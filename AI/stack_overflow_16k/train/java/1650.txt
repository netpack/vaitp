"why did we have to declare a package at the top of the code? i'm a new learner of blank and i made an ""hello youtube"" program as i watch a youtube tutorial..however, it didn't work at the first time in this form...class apples{.   public static void main(string args[]){.       system.out.println(""hello youtube!"");.  }.}...so i learnt and pictured two solutions below.....first solution: package bucky; required at the top of the code. what exactly did we solve adding package bucky?..what is the meaning of the other solution.i mean we are moving a class named apples.blank, why are we especially moving class for example?"
