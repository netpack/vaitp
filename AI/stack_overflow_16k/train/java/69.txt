"what is an efficient way operating a set of variables? i am making a ""genetic simulator"", and at some point i want to compare the data in the genes to set the result in an individual. i came to a solution, but seems quite impractical, i'm sure there is a proper way of doing it ..right now, i use a static method in a support class that handles the operation, but i fear that maintenance will be annoying, as i plan to modify the list of attributes quite often...public class geneops {  .    public static attributelist addattributelists (attributelist a, attributelist b) {.        attributelist x=new attributelist();..        x.agressiveness= a.agressiveness+b.agressiveness;.        x.bravery=a.bravery+b.bravery;.        x.speed=a.speed+b.speed;.        //repeat for all attributes..        return x;.    }.}...this works, but i would like something that is updated automatically every time i decide to add something to the list eg: if i add an attribute called sneak, i want it to be calculated without modifying the method."
