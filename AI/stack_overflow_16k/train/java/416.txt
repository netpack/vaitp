"blank.io.ioexceptoin keysize too big in windows 2003 server i have a blank project created in netbeans in ubuntu that uses blank keystore. when i run the jar file in ubuntu there is no problem and it works fine. when i run the same jar file in windows 2003 server i get the following error ..blank.io.ioexception: keysize too big. at sun.security.blankkeystore.engineload. at sun.security.provider.blankkeystore$jks.engineload. at blank.security.keystore.load...after searching the web i found it is because of out of memory error. but tried some fixes. nothing works. any idea on how to solve this problem...it looks like some environment issue. the keystore file was created in linux using keytool. .if i use keytool in windows to list the keys like this .$keytool -list -keystore file..i get keytool blank.io.ioexception keysize too big. ..if i create a keystore in windows no error in the application, but the problem is i will have to use the same keystore. it has both public and private key.  the same keystore file works perfectly in linux."
