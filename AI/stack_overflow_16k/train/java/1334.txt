"fetch expression from string [blank] i am trying to fetch a part of string that may be an expression. i didn't find any way to do this. problem is that i have a string that have may have one or more expressions and i have to fetch them...for example, string is: -..    if [100]&gt;[102] then [100]-[102] else [102]-[100]...now, here [100] is representing a value, will be retrieved from database using 100 as primary key and same as for [102], so how to fetch the following..    [100]-[102]...and..    [102]-[100]...expressions from given string...thank you!"
