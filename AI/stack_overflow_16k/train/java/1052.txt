"simple looping code won't work this is the simple code that i was practicing on since i'm totally new to blank. this is under the day8 component of the kilobot tutorial available online here: http://www.kilobolt.com/day-8-looping..public class looping {.public static void main(string args[]) {.    boolean earthisspinning = false;.    int counter = 9;..    while(counter &gt;= 1){.        counter--;.        system.out.println(counter);.        if (counter == 4){.            earthisspinning = true;.        }.        else{.            earthisspinning = false;.        }..        while (earthisspinning){.           system.out.println(""the earth is still spinning"");.        }.    }.}...and i edited the supposed tutorial that i was supposed to do. so i was wondering why the console keeps looping ""the earth is still spinning"" and not only that at 4 where earthisspinning = true, since earthisspinning is only true when counter is at 4."
