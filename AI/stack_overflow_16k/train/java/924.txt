"generate and distribute random numbers fairly in blank hi i have been trying to figure this quiz out..a lottery company shares out prizes to winning contestants every week. most weeks, more than one contestant wins, in which case they try to share out the prizes as fairly as possible. their prize distribution office has hired you to write a program that they will use to distribute prizes in the fairest way possible...the program you write should take two lines of input:...a comma-separated list of this week's prizes' values.a comma-separated names of this week's winners...for example, the input could be:.100,800,200,500,400,1000.joshua,mahesh,lilian..the program should then output the fairest possible distribution of prizes, by displaying one line for each winner, with the values of the prizes allocated to them. for example, given the input above, the output could be:...joshua:100,400,500.mahesh:1000.lilian:800,200...the example above gives a perfect solution, where all winners get the same value of prizes (total value of 1000 each). in many cases, this will not be possible, but all prizes must be distributed and cannot be divided. part of your job is to decide how you define 'fair' for these cases. for example, given the input..400,400,500,600..barry,sheila,onyango,wekesa..the following would be acceptable output, because there is no fairer distribution possible:...barry:400.sheila:400.onyango:500.wekesa:600...i am using blank and so far this is what i have come up with..import blank.util.scanner;.import blank.util.arrays;..public class main {.    private static string amounts;.    private static string names;..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner userinput = new scanner(system.in);..        system.out.print(.
