"jarfile from inside a *.jar or inputstream to file? i have a jar or war...i'm programmaticaly reading this jar, and when i find jar inside this jar i'd like to programmaticaly read it again. ..but jarfile provides only getinputstream, which i cannot pass to jarfile(file file) constructor...how to read jar from jar?..edit: i was thinking about getting the file somehow from classloader or so."
