"trying to fix project with counting integer occurrences in an array with scanner, the output is absurd this is the program in it's current state, the output is incredibly insane and i am trying to see where the mistake lies. it is either the while statement or the nested for loop but i still can not come out to any solutions, any assistance would be amazing...public static void main(string[] args) {.    scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..    int[] numbers = new int[100 + 1];.    int number = 0;.    int count = 0;..    system.out.print(""enter integers between 1 and 100: "");.    while ((number = input.nextint()) != 0) {.        numbers[number]++;.    }..    for (int m = 0; m &lt; numbers.length; m++) {.        for (int n = 0; n &lt; numbers.length; n++) {.            if (numbers[m] == numbers[n]) {.                count++;.            }..        }.        if (count &gt; 1) {.            system.out.println(numbers[m] + "" occurs "" + count + "" times"");.        } else {.            system.out.println(numbers[m] + "" occurs "" + count + "" time"");.        }.    }..}...}..the output is something like this:..0 occurs 8350 times.0 occurs 8447 times.0 occurs 8544 times.0 occurs 8641 times.0 occurs 8738 times.0 occurs 8835 times.0 occurs 8932 times.0 occurs 9029 times.0 occurs 9126 times.0 occurs 9223 times.0 occurs 9320 times.0 occurs 9417 times...when it should be something like this:..1 occurs 1 time.3 occurs 4 times"
