"increasing heap size in blank program gives problem i am using a blank program which requires a lot of ram. ( ideally i would want to give it..10 gb of ram ) ..this program is run using a bat file. which has the following command to set blank heap size..blank  -xmx896m weka.gui.explorer.explorer...which allocates it 896 mb...i am running this program on a high end 64bit server with windows 2003 64bit standard os...when i try to change the bat file to increase heap size to lets say 1.8 gb by using..blank  -xmx1896m weka.gui.explorer.explorer...it gives an error message  - ""could not reserve enough space for object heap "" and the program doesnt start..how can i give this program a greater heap size atleast upto 4 gb"
