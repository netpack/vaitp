"little blank help with loops hi i am doing some practice problems and trying to print a diagonal line like the example below. i have writen the program you see below and i honestly dont understand what i am doing wrong. i m a blank beginner and i cant see how to find the error. ..example:..*.  *.    *.      *.        *...code: ..class diagonal{.  public static void main(string args[]) {.    int row, col;...    for(row = 1; row &lt; 6; row++) {.      for(col = 1; col &lt;= row; col++) {.          if(col==row){.            system.out.print(""*"");.          } else{.              system.out.print("""");.          }.          system.out.println();     .      }.    }.  }.}...i am trying to learn for loops because they really confuse me. another practice is to print a similar diagonal line but this time from right to left. i cant do that without getting this right however :( i believe they will be pretty similar?.above my reasining is this: as long as the column # is the same as the row number the print the line or otherwise leave a blank....what's wrong with how i did it?..thank you!"
