"get input stream of zipped file? is it possible to get a file as inputstream from the zipped file? i only know this one here: how to extract a single file from a remote archive file? which gives me just the bytes of the file. ..so is there any functionality to have a method like this: inputstream getfile(string path, file zipfile) where the path is the path inside the ziped file?"
