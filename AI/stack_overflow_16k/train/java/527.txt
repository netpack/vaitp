"can you check whether your os and blank runtime are 32-bit or 64-bit from within your program? i was told there is a system environment property file i could check, however, it hasn't yielded any definite results so far. ..basically i need to see what version of the os and blank i'm running so i can copy the correct dlls to the run directory. as always, a better solution is appreciated."
