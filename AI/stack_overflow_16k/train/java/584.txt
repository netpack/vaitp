"try - catch return method is this syntax best method?..method 1:.   input.   method2():.method2: (input).   try.   catch.      return(method1()).method3: (input).   .......this is so when an exception is thrown you rarely want the program to crash, so it's best to have a return statement so the user can declare a new input for the variable. i am reading my textbook for class and they don't cover a return. otherwise, without the return, having a try-catch seems pointless if the program just terminates."
