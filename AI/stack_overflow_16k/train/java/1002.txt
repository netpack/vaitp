"coin strip: how to shift places in an array? i have this prompt: ...  create a program that represents a coin strip game that follows the rules below -.  .  .  the board consists of a series of adjacent squares. the number of squares is a variable..  at the start of the game, coins(markers) are placed on the board by one of the two players..  coins can't share the same square..  coins can't pass another coin..  coins can only move to the left..  coins may move any number of squares using the rules above..  the winner is the last person who moves a coin..  ......o=coins e=empty space.o e e o e o e o o o e o.......  if the input is 12,7,1,4,6,8,9,10,12, the output is 4,1,0,0,0..  the first 2 numbers of the input,12,7, is the amount of squares and the amount of coins(12 is number of squares, 7 is the number of coins on the board). the rest of the numbers(1,4,6,8,9,10,12) are the positions of the coins on the boards..  .  the output is the amount of coins that can move a certain amount of squares. 4,1,0,0,0 is showing that on the board above, according to the input, 4 coins can move 1 space, 1 coin can move 2 spaces, and 0 coins can move 3, 4, or 5 spaces. so therefore the output is 4,1,0,0,0. here's some other inputs and outputs according to the code:..14,6,1,3,6,7,10,14 ------- 4,3,1,0,0.10,2,4,9 ------- 2,2,2,1,0.10,2,6,10 ------- 2,2,2,1,1....right now i have this for my code:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class coinstrip_chapter10 {.    public static void main(string[]args) {.        scanner sc=new scanner(system.in);.        system.out.println(""type in your numbers(ie 12,7,1,4,6,8,9,10,12 - no spaces): "");.        string input=sc.nextline();.        sc.close();.        string[] input1=input.split("","");.        boolean[] input2=new boolean[integer.parseint(input1[0])];.        for(int i=0;i&lt;input1.length-2;i++) {.            int k=integer.parseint(input1[2+i]);.            input2[k-1]=true;.        }.    }.}...but i'm stuck on rule:...  coins can only move to the left...and i don't know how to make the array move a space with a coin to the left one space in the array. here's what i mean: ..true false false true false true false true true true false true...is the example i have. how do i move the spaces with true in them one space to the  left?..visual:..true false false true false true false true true true false true...to:..true false true false true false true true true false true false"
