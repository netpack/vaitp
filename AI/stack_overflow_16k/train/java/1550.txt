"why is my withdraw method allowing me to take out more then has been deposited? i have to write a atm program for my computer science class. it works for the most part, apart from a couple logic problems within the programs itself. so far, from what i can tell, my atm will deposit the correct amount of money that i tell it to however, when i withdraw money, it does not always withdraw the correct amount if i purposefully make an error (such as trying to take out an amount that is not a multiple of 20). i am also running into an issue where if i try to take out more money then is actually in the account, it will become a negative value, which i do not want to be allowed. i want it not to subtract the value that causes it to become negative and for it to prompt the user until a value less then or equivalent to the balance is able to be taken out. i am rather new to coding so please excuse my rather messy code. my error is probably around the else if statement where option == 3. here is my code:..import blank.io.*;.import blank.util.*;.public class atmlauncher.{.    public static int options=0;.    public static void main(string [] args).    {.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.        atmtester atm = new atmtester();..        system.out.println(""login: n(case sensitive)"");.        system.out.print(""username &gt; "");..        string usernameinput=input.nextline();.        int count=4;.        while (!usernameinput.equals(atmtester.getusername())).        {.            system.out.println(""nincorrect input. please try again. you have "" + (count-1) + "" trys remaining attempts."");.            system.out.println(""login: n(case sensitive)"");.            system.out.print(""username &gt; "");.            count--;.            if(count==0).            {.                system.out.println(""no remain attempts, system will now exit"");.                system.exit(0);.            }.            usernameinput = input.nextline();.        }..        system.out.print(""pin &gt; "");.        int pininput=input.nextint();.        int count1=4;.        while (pininput&lt;atmtester.getpin() || pininput&gt;atmtester.getpin()).        {.            system.out.println(""nincorrect input. please try again. you have "" + (count1-1) + "" trys remaining"");.            system.out.print(""pin &gt; "");.            count1--;.            pininput=input.nextint();.            if(count1==0).            {.                system.out.println(""no remain attempts, system will now exit"");.                system.exit(0);.            }.        }..        system.out.println(""nwelcome, "" + atmtester.getusername() +""!"");..        while(pininput==2468).        {.            atm.main();.            options = input.nextint();.            if (options==4).            {.                atm.logout();.            }.            else if(options==2).            {.                system.out.println(""how much money would you like to deposit?"");.                system.out.print(""$ "");.                atm.deposit = input.nextint();.                atm.balance+=atm.deposit;.                system.out.println(""your new balance is $"" + atm.balance +""0"");.            }.            else if(options==3).            {.                system.out.println(""how much money will you be withdrawing?
