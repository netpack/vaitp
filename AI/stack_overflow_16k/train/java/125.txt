"why char is actually a numerictype in blank, but not a symbolictype or string? regarding blank syntax, there is a numerictype which consists of integraltype and floatingpointtype. integraltypes are byte, short, int, long and char. ..at the same time, i can assign a single character to char variable...char c1 = 10;.char c2 = 'c';...so here is my question. why char in numeric type and how jvm convert 'c' to a number?"
