"using || or operator within if statements alongside characters i'm very new to programming in general, and i'm having a bit of trouble with a program i'm writing in blank to help calculate my final grade in a class. this part of the program asks me what letter grade i would like to receive, and then determines if that input is valid. for example, if i typed into the keyboard that i wanted to receive a letter grade of ""z"", because that is not a valid grade, i would like my program to output ""invalid input"" and exit. the code i have written below is not producing any syntax errors, but it outputs ""invalid input"" for every letter grade i choose, even a, b, and c (inputs that should be valid). any help in understanding what's wrong is more than welcome...scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..char desiredgrade..system.out.print(""what letter grade do you want to achieve for the course? "");.desiredgrade = input.next().charat(0);.if (desiredgrade != 'a' || desiredgrade != 'b' || desiredgrade != 'c'){.        system.out.println(""invalid input"");.        system.exit(0);.    }...in addition to this, it would be helpful to not have to worry about case sensitivity with the inputs. i know i can use .ignorecase() or .equalsignorecase() with strings, but i'm not quite sure how to implement that with char."
