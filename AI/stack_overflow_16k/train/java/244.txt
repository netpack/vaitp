"why is text file encoding still ansi when in the blank code i am specifying it be utf-8 i am writing a some text into file using the filewriter object. i am specifying that i want the output to be in utf-8,but when i open the text file and go to save as , i see that it is in ansi encoding...i want to also add that when there are characters other than the standard ascii charset (eg:- japansese character) the file encoding is utf-8, but without then text file encoding is ansi...file json_file= new file(path);.filewriter json_file_output=newfilewriter(json_file,standardcharsets.utf_8);.json_file_output.write(""some json text here"");.json_file_output.flush();...i am not sure whether it is due to blank code or notepad...thank you for the help."
