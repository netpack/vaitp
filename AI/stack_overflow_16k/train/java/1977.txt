"blank probecontenttype how does probe content type in blank work?..some resources highlight that it is based on file extension and other resources such as this one indicate that a bug exists...i've created a excel file and using save as i've saved it as myexcelfile.txt and probecontenttype reported it as application/zip hence proving that it is not based on extension, now this has created further confusion as the link i've provided is from oracle and states both extension wise and byte wise verification...what is the fact? how does probecontenttype actually work?"
