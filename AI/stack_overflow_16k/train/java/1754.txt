"blank8 why is my solution faster than the neat solution? (hackerrank chocolate feast) edit: simplified my solution..edit: removed opinion based secondary question...background: atarted learning blank a week or two ago using hackerranks problems as exercises and stackoverflow search + google as my teacher, i've had some limited experience learning other languages...i did the exercise my own ""noobish learner way"" which i can't help but feel is a ""botched job"" when i see ""neat &amp; short"" solutions...however, when submitting both solutions one after another a couple of times i found the ""neat"" solution was quite a bit slower. ..i vaguely remember something about % operations being costly, is mine faster because of no % operations or is there more to it than just that?..exercise: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/chocolate-feast..neat solution from discussion:..import blank.io.*;.import blank.util.*;..public class solution {.    static int cc; .    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.        int t,n,c,m,r;.            t = in.nextint();.            while(t--&gt;0){.             n = in.nextint();.            c = in.nextint();.             m = in.nextint();.                r=n/c;.                cc=r;..                    while(r&gt;=m){.                        cc=cc+r/m;.                        r=r%m+r/m;.                    }..                system.out.println(cc); .            }..    }.}...my solution:..import blank.io.*;.import blank.util.*;..public class solution {..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);.        int t = integer.parseint(sc.nextline());    //t = number of test cases.        int[][] tc = readinput(sc, t);              //tc[t][0] = money. tc[t][1] = price. tc[t][2] = wrappers per free bar..        for (int i = 0; i&lt;t; i++){                  //loop for all test cases.            int choc = calcchoc(tc,i);              //work out how much choc can be bought.            system.out.println(choc);               //print result for the test case.        }.    }.    //calculate how much choc he can buy with m $ at p price with w wrappers needed for a free bar.    public static int calcchoc(int[][] tc,int i){..        int m = tc[i][0];       //money he has.        int p = tc[i][1];       //price of choc.        int w = tc[i][2];       //wrappers per free bar..        int bars = m/p;         //how many bars he can buy initially.        int wrappers = bars;    //each bar is a wrapper from initial purpose..        //loop to turn in all wrappers while it is possible to do so.        while (w&lt;=wrappers){..            int barsfromturnin = wrappers/w;                //bars from turning in current wrappers..            bars = bars + barsfromturnin;                   //new bar count.            wrappers = wrappers - (barsfromturnin * (w-1)); //wrapper count reduced by amount of wrappers turned in -1 wrapper per bar recieved from turn in...            if (w==1){ //break out of infinite loop when you get 1 bar for 1 wrapper!.                system.out.print(""infinite bars, exiting infinite loop at bars = "");.                break;.            }.        }.        return bars;.    }.    //read input for each test case and make 2d array of the info.    public static int[][] readinput(scanner sc, int t){..        int[][] input = new int[t][3];..        for (int i = 0; i&lt;t; i++){.            string[] inputline = sc.nextline().split("" "");..            input[i][0] = integer.parseint(inputline[0]);.            input[i][1] = integer.parseint(inputline[1]);.            input[i][2] = integer.parseint(inputline[2]);.        }.        return input;.    }.}"
