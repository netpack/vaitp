"is there a way to create an immutable object in blank, when the object have mutators? this code is familiar...list&lt;character&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;character&gt;();..  // populate the list.  list.add('x');.  list.add('y');...  // make the list unmodifiable.  list&lt;character&gt; immutablelist = collections.unmodifiablelist(list);...now i have a typical model class with variables, getters and setters. can i make that object immutable,after i have invoked the setters i want? something like this is my dream.....person person = new person();.person.setfirstname(""firsname"");.person.setlastname(""lastname"");.// i have a lot to set!!- person is pretty large..// some way to do this.person stubborn = object.immutableobject(person);...i know there is no object.immutableobject()..but is it possible to achieve something like this??"
