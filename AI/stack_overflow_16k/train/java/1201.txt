"any blank static/dynamic code analyze tool to find all recursive method in my blank project i need to find all recursive methods in my projects (100+ eclipse blank/plugin projects with about ~1 millions lines of code) since we found some performance problems caused by recursive methods. we don't care about the used libraries...i would prefer open source/free and with eclipse plug-ins. static code analyzer would be even better...findbug or google's codepro seems don't have such function. also check style, pmd, etc.....any one know such tool, or give some hint to write such a feature?"
