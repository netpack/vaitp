"how can you print several elements from a string array in the tostring() method? i am trying to print each element in a string array but i seem to only be able to print a specific index. ..    public string tostring() {.        return fruits.fruitcolor + fruits.fruitname;.    }..    public string tostring() {.        return fruits[i].fruitcolor + fruits[i].fruitname;.        i++; // i don't understand why the int i cannot be incremented to print out the next set of information?.    }...i don't know if i like the arrays.tostring(array) method because i don't necessarily want the [] format, but rather specific information from each element in chronological order. i attempted for loops as well in the tostring() method, which also failed. any suggestions are appreciated."
