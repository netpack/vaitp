"how to test a sso using tokens in blank? i have to two applications :.  a : is the parent application.  b  : is the child application...when the user has to access b , he needs to sign in to a , which creates a token, and then the user can access b with that token..manually using post-man i was able to test the flow.   how can i write automation for the same flow. how can my automation test in b access the same token from a and use it ? my automation will be using the restassure lib...both the applications are in blank...manually using post-man this is what i have so far :..curl -x post .  http://localhost:8080/applicationb/endpoint .  -h 'authorization: bearer &lt;token_value&gt;' ...i got the token_value by login into a that created the token that i used."
