"initialization of static method when class loads in blank i have a doubt regarding static methods. in the program written below, output will be: main. i understand this because main is a static method, so when class loads, it executes. if so, the same principle should apply for met() also, right? as it is also static. why does only main executes whereas met() doesn't when the class loads?  ..public class test {..    static void met() {.        system.out.println(""method"");    .    }..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        system.out.println(""main"");    .    }    .}"
