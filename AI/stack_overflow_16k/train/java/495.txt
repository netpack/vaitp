"how to over ride a inputstream method read() to return a character? the question was: develop a class converttolowercase that derives from fileinputstream and overrides the read() method that is derived from fileinputstream such that overriding read() method returns a lower case character.  use this class to convert the file information in in.txt to lowercase text and write it to the file out.txt...the problem is that the program crashes in the middle and gives an error of unhandled heap, and it doesn't print the last word i.e. head in the out.txt..here's the in.txt: ..how high he holds his haughty head...here's the out.txt: ..how high he holds his haughty ...(notice the word head is missing)..i can't figure out the problem. any help would be appreciated :)..//converttolowercase class.import blank.io.fileinputstream;.import blank.io.filenotfoundexception;.import blank.io.ioexception;.public class coverttolowercase extends fileinputstream { //inherits from fileinputstream..public coverttolowercase(string name) throws filenotfoundexception {.    super(name);.    // todo auto-generated constructor stub.}...public int read() throws ioexception {.    char c=(char) super.read(); //calling the super method read.    c=character.tolowercase(c);.    return c;   .}..}..import blank.io.fileoutputstream;.import blank.io.filenotfoundexception;.import blank.io.ioexception;..public class hw4ex2 {..public static void main(string[] args) throws filenotfoundexception {.    coverttolowercase c1=null;.    fileoutputstream output=null;..    try {... c1= new coverttolowercase(""c:/users/user/workspace/hw4ex2/in.txt"");.     output= new fileoutputstream(""c:/users/user/workspace/hw4ex2/out.txt"");.        int a;.        while ((a=c1.read()) != -1).        {.            system.out.print(a);.            output.write(a);..        }.    } catch (ioexception e) {.        // todo auto-generated catch block.        e.printstacktrace();.    }..    }..}"
