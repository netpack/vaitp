"project specific key of list of objects from a list of key array blank spring i have this list of array : ..list&lt;string&gt; keylist = [""key1"", ""key2"", ""key3""]...and i have a list of objects like this:..[{.""key1"": 1,.""key2"": 2,.""key3"": 3,.""key4"": 4.}, {.""key1"": 2,.""key2"": 4,.""key3"": 6,.""key4"": 7.}]...and i want to only take those elements that i have in keylist. ..so in final list, i won't have ""key4"". ..my approach was to use two for loops - first for the list of objects and then keylist. ..i need to know if there's any better approach to do this. maybe an inbuilt function that i am not aware of. ..note: one is list, other is list. i don't think i can just compare or take the intersection of these two list."
