"how to switch the right side of the jsplite between blank/jtabbedpane i have a jsplitpane where on the left side  i show a list and on the right side there is jtabbedpane. if i click on a list item,  then the jtabbedpane will update the info. everything works good...now my question is, when no list item is clicked on ( so basically when you run it first time), then i want to to replace the jtabbedpane with empty panel (blank right side). i tried to do setvisibility to be off on the jtabbedpane but then the divider is pushed all the way to the right. is there a quick way to just make this jtabbedpane blank and then somehow make it appear later on. here are screenshots to better explain the situation:..fully functional window...what i want when no item is clicked...what happens if no item is clicked"
