where is the blank.exe that launched me? is there some way i can find the path to the blank.exe that launched me?..in this case i am on windows but if there is a general solution i would welcome it...added..fyi: in most cases my tool will be launched from a full path to an unregistered blank.exe. e.g. c:abcdefsdkjrebinblank -jar mytool.jar. can i find the c:abcdefsdkjrebin...yes it is rather self-referential. :)
