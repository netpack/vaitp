"can method return more than one type i am new to blank and trying to understand the below code:..int somemethod() {.    return (true ? null : 0);.}...the method's return type is int, but it can return both null and int, is this correct behavior in blank? can a blank method return more than one type? this may sound silly for those who are experienced, but i have just took my first step in blank."
