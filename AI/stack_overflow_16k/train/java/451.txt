"system.exit(0) reached before maximum user attempts made reached i may have confused my self with the logic for some time now and i could use some assistance. so i have created this function to return a voucher # (size is 4-digits). the pre-condition is two characters entered must be correct and in their respective placing below the application reveals the rest of the voucher digits (when compared with voucher in record). ..i am giving the user 3 attempts to search the voucher with the only two known voucher digits. after three attempts and if the voucher does not exist. i'll lock the user and close the app with system.exit(0)...however, system.exit(0) executes when attempt = 3. it seems i don't have control over my loop...int attempts = 3;..while (attempts != 0){.. if(vouchernumber.charat(0) == voucherrecord.charat(0) &amp;&amp;.           vouchernumber.charat(1) == voucherrecord.charat(1))..           system.out.println(""reveal all digits"");..         }..        else if(vouchernumber.charat(0) == voucherrecord.charat(0) &amp;&amp;.                vouchernumber.charat(2) == voucherrecord.charat(2) ){..                system.out.println(""reveal all digits"");..        }..        else{..               system.out.println(""reveal all digits"");..               attempts--;   ...               if (attempts == 0){..                    system.exit(0);.               }                                        .        }"
