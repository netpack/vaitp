"removing hexadecimal utf-8 characters in blank i know this question has been asked before, but none of the solutions seemed to work for this particular problem..my blank application receives a username from another server. the username sometimes contains the hexadecimal representation of utf-8 characters...for example: ""féçon"" comes in as fc3a9c3a7on...none of the examples i found on this site (most of them use ""getbytes"") worked. no idea why...so my question is: if you have defined a string with these characters, how can you remove them so it looks right again? you can try it yourself by using the following:..string test = ""fc3a9c3a7on""..thanks!.mike"
