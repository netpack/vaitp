"blank noob question - how to store a string to a new text file here is my scenario:..selenium grabbed some text on the html page and convert it to a string (string store_txt = selenium.gettext(""text"");) - the text is dynamically generated...now i want to store this string into a new text file locally every time i run this test, should i use filewriter? or is it as simple as writing a system.out.println(""string"");?..do i have to write this as a class or can i write a method instead?..thanks in advance!!"
