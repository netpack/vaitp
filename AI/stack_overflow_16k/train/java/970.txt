"for loops output not what i wanted i am a newbie in blank and doing practiceit questions online.i came across this question and was stuck for quite some time...write a class named dicesum that prompts the user for a desired sum, then repeatedly rolls two six-sided dice until their sum is the desired sum. here is the expected dialogue with the user:..desired dice sum: 9.4 and 3 = 7.3 and 5 = 8.5 and 6 = 11.5 and 6 = 11.1 and 5 = 6.6 and 3 = 9...this is what i have done...import blank.util.random;.import blank.util.scanner;.public class dicesum{.    public static void main(string[] args){.        system.out.print(""desired dice sum: "");.        scanner sc=new scanner(system.in);.        int input=sc.nextint();..        random rnd=new random();.        int r1=rnd.nextint(7);.        int r2=rnd.nextint(7);..        int sum=0;.        for(int i=0;i&lt;6;i++){.             sum=r1+r2;.            system.out.println(r1 + ""and"" + r2 + ""="" + sum);..        }..    }.}...my output is ..desired dice sum:9.0 and 2=2.0 and 2=2.0 and 2=2.0 and 2=2.0 and 2=2.0 and 2=2...i dont understand how come it will print 0 and 2 for 6 times without giving another random number.i am thinking if i should create a few more int r3=rnd.nextint(7),int r4=rnd.nextint(7)..but i was thinking it will be lengthy but it is a possible way to do it."
