"using a class within an enhanced for-loop i've written a class that implements collection and iterable, and i am attempting to run it through an enhanced for-loop now. you can find it here: linkedqueue..the point of the class is to be able to go through the collection using linkedqueue.getnext(), which works fine. however i also want to be able to iterate over the values once using a for loop. the current code:..linkedqueue&lt;string&gt; queue = new linkedqueue();.queue.add(""test one"");.queue.add(""test two"");.queue.add(""test three"");.system.out.println(""queue.size = "" + queue.size());.system.out.println(""contents:"");.for (string s : queue) {.    system.out.print(""test: "");.    system.out.println(s);.}.system.out.println(""contents (x9):"");.for (int i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++) {.    system.out.println(queue.getnext());.}...prints out this:..queue.size = 3.contents:.contents (x9):.test one.test two.test three....etc......so it seems that the for loop isn't printing properly. i don't think it's an issue of size, since the queue has a size of 3 before starting. so now my problem is most likely ""what is wrong with the iterable methods"", which are hasnext(), next(), and remove() (which is unsupported in this queue). what am i doing wrong?"
