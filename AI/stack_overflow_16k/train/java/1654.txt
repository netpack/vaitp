"blank interface to only define method names (ie variable argument) let's say i want to create some crud resources. each will have create, update, delete, fetch, and list method. the return type for all of these would be identical, but the argument to these things will be different. ..is there a way that i can create an interface that defines the return type and the method name, but allows for variable argument? ..for example,..class user implements crud {.    int create(final string first_name, final string last_name);.}..class country implements crud {.    int create(final string name);.}...both have a create method that returns int, but each has a different argument."
