"setting a primitive data type through the use of a field object is there any way to set the value of a primitive through the use of fields? i've tried to play around with the following, but can't seem to get it to work...temp[i].setint(new object(), new integer(data[0]));...in this case temp would be an array of declared fields. the current index i holds a field that holds a primitive int value. is this sort of thing even possible?"
