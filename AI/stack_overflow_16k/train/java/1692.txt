"why is .length giving me the length of the return statement as opposed to user input? first question here, i've searched around quite a bit for applying the .length method to user input. unfortunately none of the questions that have been answered touch on the specifics of my situation...i'm working a school project that has two parts. the first part is rolling 2 dice until the sum of the 2 dice are either 7 or 11, then printing a message saying what each die rolled, and their total...the second part of the assignment is where i am having trouble. we are supposed to get the user to input 2 strings and have blank order the 2 strings alphabetically, and use .length to display the length of the two strings, then add them up. i've gotten as far as getting user input, but when i try to calculate the length of the strings, it just gives me the length of the return string at the end of the method.  so when the user inputs ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" i end up getting 10 and 26, because it's counting the length of ""thank you!"" and ""thank you! now watch this!"" i've tried putting the .length within the 'inputstring' and 'inputanotherstring' method, which didn't work. ..import blank.io.*;.import blank.math.*;..public class main {..    public static void main(string[] args) throws ioexception {..        boolean keeprolling = true;.        while (keeprolling) {.            int dieone = rolldice();.            int dietwo = rolldice();.            int dicetotal = (dieone + dietwo);..            if (dicetotal == 7 || dicetotal == 11) {.                system.out.println(""you rolled a "" + dieone + "" and a "" + dietwo + "": total = "" + dicetotal + "". you win!"");.                break;.            } else {.                system.out.println(""you rolled a "" + dieone + "" and a "" + dietwo + "": total = "" + dicetotal + "". roll again!"");.            }.        }..        string firststring;.        firststring = inputstring();.        system.out.println(firststring);..        string secondstring;.        secondstring = inputanotherstring();.        system.out.println(secondstring);..        int lengthone = firststring.length();.        system.out.println(lengthone);..        int lengthtwo = secondstring.length();.        system.out.println(lengthtwo);..        int totallength = lengthone + lengthtwo;.        system.out.println(totallength);..    }..    public static int rolldice() {..        return 1+ (int)(math.random()*((6-1)+1));..    }..    public static string inputstring() {..        string stringone;.        bufferedreader in;.        in = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(system.in));.        system.out.println(""enter a string!"");.        try {.            stringone = in.readline();.        } catch(ioexception e) {..        }.        return ""thank you!"";.    }..    public static string inputanotherstring() {..        string stringtwo;.        bufferedreader in;.        in = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(system.in));.        system.out.println(""enter another string!"");.        try {.            stringtwo = in.readline();.        } catch(ioexception e) {..        }.        return ""thank you! now watch this!"";.    }.}...any help would be greatly appreciated!"
