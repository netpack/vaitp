"having trouble with printing out my output statement once without looping this program is supposed to allow for the user to enter a student's name and score 10 times and output the average and the students' name that is below and greater than/equal to the average. when it gets to the point of the program where it outputs the students who have a score greater/less than the average, it does so in a loop instead of having only printing out all of the names once. what am i doing wrong?..thank you`import blank.util.scanner;..public class grades{..   public static void main(string[] args){..   //create a keyboard representing the scanner.      scanner console = new scanner(system.in);..   //define variables.      double [] score = new double[10];..      string [] name = new string[10];.      double average = 0.0, sum = 0.0, studentaverage = 0.0, highestscore = 0.0, lowestscore = 0.0;...      for(int i= 0; i &lt; score.length; i++){  ..         system.out.println(""enter the student's name: "");.         name[i] = console.next();.         system.out.println(""enter the student's score: "");.         score[i] = console.nextdouble();..         sum += score[i];..      }//end for loop..      //calculate average .      average = sum/score.length;..      system.out.println(""the average score is: "" + average);...      int highestindex = 0; ..      for(int i = 1; i &lt; score.length; i++){..         if(score[highestindex] &lt; score[i]){..            highestindex = i; ..         }..         if(score[i] &lt; average){.            system.out.print(""nnames of students whose test scores are less than average: "" + name[i]);.         }..         if(score[i] &gt;= average){.            system.out.print(""nnames of students whose test scores are greater than or equal to average: "" + name[i]);.         }...      }//end for loop..   }//end main..}//end clas...`"
