"how to profile and log slow methods in long lived blank application? is there any easy way to...profile and write out to the file what methods are slow (>1sec).in a long lived blank application.without any expensive overhead?...with all profilers i know (yourkit, netbeans, etc), i always have to watch the graphical monitor whether or not a problem occurs..instead, i just want to get a hint to solve the problem by seeking log files when a problem occurs in customers side."
