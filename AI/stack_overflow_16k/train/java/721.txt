"how to take a specific line from a text file and read it into an array? (blank) i've been trying to code a quiz game in blankfx where i store the questions on a text file and then randomize a number then use it to call the line of the same number on the text file and read it into an array. ..after looking online i can only seem to find how to read a text file line by line instead of a specific line. i also use the following code to read the text file but am unsure where to go on from there...file file = new file(""/users/administrator/desktop/short questions.txt"");.filereader filereader = new filereader(file);.bufferedreader bufferedreader = new bufferedreader(filereader);.string line;"
