"significance of && in if() i would like to know is there any difference in performance between these two codes...string sample=""hello"";.    if(sample!=null).    {.       if(!sample.equals("""")).        {.            // some code in here.         }.    }...or..string sample=""hello"";.    if(sample!=null &amp;&amp; !sample.equals("""")).    {..            // some code in here.    }...as far as i have understood, in the first code, if sample is not null then only it will go in to the block. same is the case with 2nd piece of code..what i would like to know is what is the difference in performance or better coding standards and why?"
