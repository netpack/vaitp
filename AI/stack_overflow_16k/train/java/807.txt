"blank bubble sort - infinite loop the issue is that i am getting an infinite loop when i try to run....  boolean flag = true;..   do {.       flag = false;.       for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.length-1; ++i) {.           if (list[i] &gt; list[i + 1]) {.               swap(list, i, i + 1);.               flag = true;.           }..       }.   }.   while (flag == true);....edit: i should have said that the problem is with the while loop, but it's due to what is happening in the for loop..the swap function works because i have used it for other things before.here is the array list if that is really needed...int [] list;.list = new int[5];.list[0] = 4; .list[1] = 5;.list[2] = 12;.list[3] = 9;.list[4] = 3;"
