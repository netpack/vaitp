"counting length of string when only an object is passed through? i'm currently on an 'intermediate' book for blank but they don't supply the answers to most of the questions (probably should get a new book)..but in the book they ask this question and say it's pretty easy...write a class shortwordfilter that implements the filter interface and only accepts words that are less than 5 characters. that is the method accept will return true if the number of characters is less than 5; otherwise, the accept method returns false...so i implemented it on eclipse and this is the code:..@override.public boolean accept(object x) {.    return false;.}...i mean, i have absolutely no idea, plus i dont have a tutor to help me so i hope you guys can give me some guidance because the stuff i've tried doesn't work."
