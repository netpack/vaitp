"calculate average from sources that sends data at different time. in my current project, i am going to write a function of calculating average temperature...a notatable  point of this function is that  it receives data from many temperature sources at different time. could you advise me ""how can i write a function with such a behavior?""..for instance,  following function receives tempsensordata from many temperature sensors, which sends temperature data at different time. i need to write a logic of calculating average temperature.   ..public void calculateroomavgtemp(tempstruct tempsensordata) {..   // write logic of calculating average temperature...}"
