"blank library to find objects in image and create subimages i have an image with a few items- a car, a person a tree and a mailbox. i want to cut the image around each item and create a sub-image of each. now i would have one image with a car, one with a person and one with a mailbox. there may be an overlap of other objects, but the predominant feature in each would be the main object...what library is there that can do this, or at least what technologies that i could merge to do this?..thanks."
