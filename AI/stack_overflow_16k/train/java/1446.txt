"passing subclasses for instantiation i have an abstract class tool, it is subclassed by various classes like hammer, screwdriver, etc...tool has a constructor with parameters ..tool(string name, double weight, double length)...i would then like to within another class, tooluser, create objects from a tool class that is passed to it. ..class tooluser {.    void createtool(***pass the tool somehow here***) {.        for (int i=1; i&lt;10; i++) {         .           // create tool object from passed tool class .           // could be hammer, screwdriver, etc. whatever was passed.        }..        // tooluser will then use the instantiated objects as .        // tool objects.. it doesn't care if they are hammers, .        // screwdrivers or anything else.. it will just access them as.        // a tool object.    }.}...i couldn't figure out how to do this passing hammer to createtool(class toolclass), the reason was because the blank compiler complained about using subclasses.. ..is this possible somehow using reflection or lambda expressions?..i also would like to pass along the parameter data somehow (weight and length) so that i can either instantiate the class using those parameters - if that is possible...anyone have any ideas how to do this.. i know nothing about lambda expressions really and my attempts at using reflection have failed."
