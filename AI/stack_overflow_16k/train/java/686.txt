"how to compile a blank project with a terminal/cmd i got tired of using eclipse because it was too ""plain"" and ""old style"". so i moved on to a program called sublime text 3 and i used a package named ""material theme"" which made the program look flat and all nice and stuff...but i wanted to code blank in that but i don't know how to compile stuff without using an ide and it was not easy to find out but i found out that you could do it through the terminal/cmd of your operating system...but what i don't understand is how i could actually use the blankc command which means blank compile and i searched and i didn't find out because i couldn't understand anything that was posted on either youtube or stack overflow because i'm new to this whole terminal/cmd blank compiling thing."
