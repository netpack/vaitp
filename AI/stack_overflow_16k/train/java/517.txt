"blank get query expansion terms does anyone know if its possible to easily get query expansion terms programmatically using blank?..for example when you do a google search, at the bottom of the results page there is a ""searches related to [term]"" section, is there a way to harvest those terms? i feel like this would be easiest. ..i dont want to create my own query expansion algorithm because of time constraints and would like a quick and easy way to get the terms...for example ""fashion design"" -> [""fashion design courses"", ""fashion design careers"", ""fashion design sketches""]..thank you in advance for any help ..-mc"
