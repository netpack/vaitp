"implementing search box in my blank program i am making simple browser. i want to implement a search box which will automatically redirect to the results of search for example in http://uk.ask.com/ it looks quite simple...if i was going to search for ""hello so"" it link would look like this...http://uk.ask.com/web?qsrc=1&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir&amp;q=hello+so+&amp;dm=all..so what i am wanting to do is make a jtextfield where user can enter what he is searching for, and then just fill in whatever he typed into the url..http://uk.ask.com/web?qsrc=1&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir&amp;q=""fill here with + instead of spaces           ""&amp;dm=all..i don't know how to split the string entered and fill the spaces with + signs. any idea ?.also this is just the way i thought it would be possible to do it. i would much appreciate any other suggestions. thanks in advance"
