"copying a temp file i have tried searching for the answer this problem but have not found it exactly. i am trying to determine how to make a hard copy of a temp file. all my searching only showed how to copy a standard file...my program allows the user to upload a file. this file is then read and analyzed and a new temp file is created and written to. ..next i want to copy the temp file to an actual hard location depending on a user selection. ..the reason i am doing it like this is that the actual program i am writing used to have the user upload a file and select the save destination during the beginning but i have been asked to make the program only ask for the save destination in the very end. this is why i need a temp file to hold the data until the end of the program when the user is asked for the destination...note that this code sets the destination:..while(saveapproval==false){//while the user does not have approval of the save location.....        jfilechooser chooser2 = new jfilechooser();//creates a new jfilechooser object...        savefile = chooser2;//sets the save file location to chooser2. ..        chooser2.setfileselectionmode(jfilechooser.directories_only);//user is only able to scan for .        //directories. ..        //completes once the user clicks okay. .        int returnvalue2 = chooser2.showdialog(chooser2, ""directory to save"");.        if(returnvalue2 == jfilechooser.approve_option){.            saveapproval=true;.        }else{.            system.exit(0);.        }..        }...so i want to take the file variable nachafile and copy the temp data into it. i then want to save nachafile into the savefile variable directory the user has selected. below you will find my complete sample code i have created:..package testingtemp;..import blank.io.bufferedreader;.import blank.io.bufferedwriter;.import blank.io.file;.import blank.io.ioexception;.import blank.io.filereader;.import blank.io.filewriter;..import blankx.swing.jfilechooser;.import blankx.swing.filechooser.filenameextensionfilter;..public class mainclass ..{..    public static jfilechooser uploadfile;.    public static jfilechooser savefile;.    public static boolean uploadapproval;.    public static boolean saveapproval;.    public static file temp;.    public static file nachafile;..    public static void main(string args[]){..        while(uploadapproval==false){//while upload approval has not been given....            jfilechooser chooser = new jfilechooser();//creates a new object of the jfilechooser class. ..            uploadfile = chooser;//saves the upload file variable as the chooser response. ..            chooser.setdialogtitle(""please choose ach file to upload"");//sets the title bar text. ..            //completes once the user clicks ok. .            int returnval = chooser.showopendialog(chooser);//.            if(returnval == jfilechooser.approve_option){.                uploadapproval=true;.            }else{.                system.exit(0);.            }..            try{..                file temp = file.createtempfile(""nachatemp"", "".ach"");..            }catch(ioexception e){..                e.printstacktrace();..            }..        bufferedreader reader = null;.        bufferedwriter writer = null;..        try{..            reader = new bufferedreader(new filereader(uploadfile.getselectedfile()));....            writer = new bufferedwriter(new filewriter(temp));..            string line;..            while((line = reader.readline()) != null){..                writer.write(""1"");..            }..            while(saveapproval==false){//while the user does not have approval of the save location....                jfilechooser chooser2 = new jfilechooser();//creates a new jfilechooser object...                savefile = chooser2;//sets the save file location to chooser2. ..                chooser2.setfileselectionmode(jfilechooser.directories_only);//user is only able to scan for .                //directories. ..                //completes once the user clicks okay. .                int returnvalue2 = chooser2.showdialog(chooser2, ""directory to save"");.                if(returnvalue2 == jfilechooser.approve_option){.                    saveapproval=true;.                }else{.                    system.exit(0);.                }..                }...        }catch (ioexception e){..            e.printstacktrace();..        }finally{..            try{..                reader.close();.                writer.close();..            }catch (ioexception e){..                e.printstacktrace();..            }..        }..    }..files.copy(temp, savefile.getselectedfile()+""thisisatest.ach"");...}..}"
