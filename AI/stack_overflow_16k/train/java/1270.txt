"how this method is called without using the classname i wanted to know how a static method is called in another class...assume i have a class as following,..class classa.{.public static void method1(string a).{.}.}...in another class the method method1 is called as following,..class classb.{.public static void main(string[] args).{. method1(""alpha"");. }. }...please note that the classb is not extending the classa, i am confused."
