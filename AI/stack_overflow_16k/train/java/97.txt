"different object array elements refer to the same object? i have an object array that i am using to store different objects. when i try to get the data from either object, it gives the last object's data. i made some new testing files and cut everything down to the problem itself. here is what i mean: ..public class test.{.  public static objecttest[] objarray = new objecttest[2];..  public static void main(string[] args).  {.    objarray[0] = new objecttest(""jimmy"");.    objarray[1] = new objecttest(""terry"");.    system.out.println(objarray[0].getname());.    system.out.println(objarray[1].getname());.  }.}...this outputs:..terry.terry...here is objecttest.blank as well:..public class objecttest.{.  private static string name;..  public objecttest(string nm).  {.    name = nm;.  }..  public static string getname().  {.    return name;.  }.}...what's making this print out the name for the last object? aren't there supposed to be 2 different objects here? there seems to be only 1."
