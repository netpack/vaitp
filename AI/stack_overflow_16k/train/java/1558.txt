"blank mouse pressed - without events is there a way, in blank, to directly check whether one of the mouse buttons is down without using events, listeners etc. ? i'd like to have a thread that, every 100 milliseconds or so, checks whether a mouse button is down and then does something. so if the user holds a mouse button down for a while it will trigger several responses...so what i'm looking for is a method that gives the state of the mouse, without going through the usual event - handling system...thanks"
