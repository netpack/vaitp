"how do you make an object move opposite direction? i need to make a boat move in its opposite direction when it hits out of bounds (8, -8)...the boat moves but adding its current velocity to its current position. if the boat hits a boundary it turns around and moves in the opp. direction.....    }..public void move(int direction).{.    this.position = position + direction;.    this.velocity = velocity + position;.    if ( position &gt; 5).    {.        direction = - 1;..    }.    else if ( position &lt; -5).    {.        direction = + 1;.    }...    }.}...it does not work.. any help would be great...thank you :)"
