"is it possible to put specific information into an interface? so i have a question about interfaces after experimenting for a bit: can specific information be put into one?..here's my interface:..public interface weapon{.   public int damage();.   public int range();.   public string name();.   public int rateoffire();.   public string[] applicableoperators();.   public void getspecs(); //this is the method in which i have a question.}...next, i implement it into the given gun: the r4c...public class r4c implements weapon{.   @override.   public int damage(){.      return 34;.   }..   @override.   public int range(){.      return 20; //meters.   }..   @override.   public string name(){.      return ""r4-c"";.   }.   @override.   public int rateoffire(){.      return 850; //rounds per minute.   }..   public string[] applicableoperators(){.      string[] appops = new string[1];.      appops[0] = ""ash"";.      return appops;.   }.   public void getspecs(){.      system.out.printf(""name: %sndamage: %dn rate of fire: %dn"".     + ""range: %dn"", name(), damage(), rateoffire(), range());..      system.out.println(""napplicable operators:"");..      for(int arraycount = 0; arraycount &lt; applicableoperators().length; arraycount++){.          system.out.printf(""%sn"", applicableoperators()[arraycount]);.      }.   }.}...so i want to have the ""getspecs"" method always have the same output. no matter which gun is being put in, i always want this same format:..name: (weaponname) ..damage: (damage)..rate of fire: (rof)..range: (range)..applicable operators:..ash..is there a way to do this inside an interface? or would i just have to make a seperate method meant for output somewhere else? i know this is probably a basic question, but because i understand so little of interfaces so far, any input could help..thanks!"
