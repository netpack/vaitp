"blank - overlay 2 images - above image get the form of below image i want to done this, using blank:....i can use blankfx by applying blend mode on top image. in this case i use linear burn...but this is not ok. if i use other colors, linear burn is no longer ok(top image color is changed to much), i need to use other blend mode...so, my question is this: there is a library which can transform(morph?) top image by what is under it?(i don't know how exactly to explain, leave a comment if you don't understand)..edit 1:..here is an example where linear burn is not good:....in this case i should apply exclusion blend mode. also exclusion is still not very good, but is the one which nearly keep the original color of top image(blue)...my intention is to create an app which does this blend mode automatically, but i can't find a rule or a blend mode which work in all cases. there could be any kind  color for both layers, top and bottom."
