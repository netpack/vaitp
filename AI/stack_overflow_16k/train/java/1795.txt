"a blank driver from c i am trying to wrap a driver for a db with a blank api. i am able to call the driver through jni. though this was a big task for me, i now understand that this is just the beginning. what are the other testing that i need to do to make sure my blank driver works correctly? i am testing the character encoding and some data type conversions. but is there anything i have to test that i do not do."
