"blank manipulatin scanner input i'm very new to blank and currently doing an introduction course.  i'm working on a program which creates two basketball teams and asks the user to input scores for the two teams...to add a score to the first team the user enters 'a' followed by a space and the amount of points to be added.  to add to the second team 'b' followed by space and points is used...now everything works great but i want the game to finish when the user enters 'exit' instead of 'a 2' or 'b 1' etc...i've set up my class and methods accordingly but my problem is that it either works great adding scores or reading exit and bringing up the final score..not both...in other words, i manage to store the input 'exit' correctly or 'a 2' etc. but whenever the one works the other one doesn't...i've played around with various code combinations but none work, this is what i've got currently:..if (keyboard.nextline().equals(""exit"")) {.        system.out.println(""exit"");.    }.    else {.        team = keyboard.next();.        points = keyboard.next();.        system.out.println(""not exit"");.    }...this prints out exit when i type exit when asked for a score...but when i enter for arguments sake 'a 2' it just hangs...i'm not allowed to use array's unfortunately.  please help."
