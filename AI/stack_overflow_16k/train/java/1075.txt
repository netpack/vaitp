"blank bicycle and bicycle test i have a problem to write my code. this is a code where i have to create an object class and run it using another class object..the program is called bicycle and bicycletest..i was given the bicycle program (its already been written) and all i need i write bicycletest to utilize the bicycle..now, the problem is, i have created 2 object, called nicebicycle and coolbicycle. i need to change my nicebicycle name to ""kenny mccormick, but i cant do it. i keep getting error saying .""error: variable nicebicycle might not have been initialized"" for this line of command that i write...// change the owner's name to kenny mccormick using setownername.    nicebicycle.setownername(""kenny mccormick"");..what should i do?..anyway, here is the bicycle code, and bicycletest that i write based on the instructor command..thank you for your reply..bicycle.blank..public class bicycle.{..// instance field.private string ownername;.private int licensenumber;..// constructor.public bicycle( string name, int license ).{.     ownername = name;.     licensenumber = license;.}..// returns the name of this bicycle's owner.public string getownername().{.     return ownername;.}..// assigns the name of this bicycle's owner.public void setownername( string name ).{.     ownername = name;.}..// returns the license number of this bicycle.public int getlicensenumber().{.     return licensenumber;.}..// assigns the license number of this bicycle.public void setlicensenumber( int license ) .{.     licensenumber = license;.}...}..and here is bicycletest.blank that i wrote...  public class bicycletest .   {..    public static void main( string[] args ).    {..    // create 1 bicycle reference variable. for example: mybike.    bicycle nicebicycle;..    // create 1 string reference variable for the owner's name.    string name;..    // create 1 integer variable for license number.    int licencenumber;..    // assign your full name and a license number to the string and.    // integer variables.    name = ""boo yeah"";.    int licensenumber = 9972;..    // create a bicycle object with the bicycle class constructor.    // use the variables you created as arguments to the constructor.    bicycle coolbicycle = new bicycle( ""boo yeah"", 9972 );..    // output the owner's name and license number in printf statements.    // using the object reference and the get methods..    // for example: bike.getownername().    system.out.printf (""the coolbicycle owner's name is %snthe license number is %dn"", coolbicycle.getownername(), coolbicycle.getlicensenumber());..    // change the owner's name to kenny mccormick using setownername.    nicebicycle.setownername(""kenny mccormick"");..    // output the owner's name and license number in printf statements.      // using the bicycle object reference variable and the get methods..      system.out.printf (""the nicebicycle owner's name is %sn"", nicebicycle.getownername());. }...}"
