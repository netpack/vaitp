"receiving a nosuchelementexception for project i am working on a program which is meant to take data from a file and write it to a new file if it meets certain criteria. however, running my code gives me a nosuchelementexception at line 41, where the first token is supposed to be made (name = st.nexttoken();). i'm not entirely sure why this is occurring. am i using the stringtokenizer correctly, or is it a problem with my loop?..here is the full code:..import blank.util.*;.import blank.io.*;..public class warning1.{.public static void main (string[] args) throws ioexception.{..int credithrs, n = 0;     // number of semester hours earned.double qualitypts, gpa; // number of quality points earned and grade .point (quality point) average.    string name = """", inputname = ""students.dat"", outputname = .""warning.dat"";.    try{.    file file = new file(inputname);.    scanner scan = new scanner(file);..    filewriter fw = new filewriter(outputname);.    printwriter pw = new printwriter(fw);..    string[] filelines = new string[100]; //create an array of .strings..    while(scan.hasnext()).    {.        filelines[n] = scan.nextline();.        n++;.    }.    int m = n;.    scan.close();.    for(int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++).    {.        stringtokenizer st = new stringtokenizer(filelines[i], "" ""); .//declare a stringtokenizer.        name = st.nexttoken();.        credithrs = integer.parseint(st.nexttoken());.        qualitypts = double.parsedouble(st.nexttoken());.        gpa = qualitypts / (double) credithrs;.        if ((gpa &lt; 1.5 &amp;&amp; credithrs &lt; 30) || (gpa &lt; 1.75 &amp;&amp; credithrs .&lt; 60)).        {.            pw.println(name + "" "" + credithrs + "" "" + gpa);.        }.    }.    pw.close();.    }.    catch (filenotfoundexception exception).    {.        system.out.println(""the requested file is not located in the .package. please move it to it's destination."");.    }.    catch (numberformatexception exception).    {.        system.out.println(""the program could not parse the data .properly. make sure each line in the file contains a string, integer, .and double, in that order"");.    }.    catch (ioexception exception).    {.        system.out.println(""unexpected error. please check your source file and try again"");.    }.}.}"
