"reuse the actionlistener i am working on a gui card game and i am wondering if there is a way i can improve my code. here is my situation. ..i have three cards: a, b and c. players are free to replace a card by clicking on one of three buttons: button1, button2 or button3, respectively. ..class rpbtn implements actionlistener {.    public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {.        image1 = new imageicon(mydeck.mydeck[5].filename);.        label_image1.seticon(image1);.    }.}...the variable names are fixed. yet, i don't want to create 3 similar inner class by just changing variable name from 1 to 2 or 3. is there a way that i can reuse/improve these codes?.thank you."
