"double not initializing + system.out.println() not displaying i'm trying to make a computing tax calculator for an assignment and everything works fine, except when i try to use one double i made, called 'tax'. my ide keeps saying that the 'tax' double is never being used... though i'm 90% sure i initialized it, and the program runs fine otherwise...the ""system.out.println()"" i entered after everything also isn't printing, and there's no resources that i've searched that can help me out. please help?..thanks for the read, have a blast of a weekend folks...here's my code:...        public class computingtaxes{.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        /*.        prompt for filing status. no problems here.         */.        system.out.println();.        system.out.print(.
