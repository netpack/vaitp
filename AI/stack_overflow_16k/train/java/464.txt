"shift array by k i am working on a small blank program, its very basic and one of my functions shifts the alphabet by a given key. i have got it working, but its shifting the wrong way, how can i make it shift the other direction?..public static char[] ouralphabet = {'a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z'};...    public  char[] shiftalphabet(int key) {..            int length = ouralphabet.length;..            char[] result = new char[length];..            for (int i=0; i &lt; length; i++).            {.                result[(i+key+26)%length] = ouralphabet[i];.            }..            return result;.    }...im guessing its very simple, but its confused me!..for example;. with a key 19 produces;.hijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefg..when is should produce;.tuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrs"
