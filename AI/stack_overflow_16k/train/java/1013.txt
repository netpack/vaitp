"my calculator program is not recognising first method and subtracts for both methods, why? import blank.util.scanner;..public class calc {..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        scanner taken = new scanner(system.in);.        int fnum;.        int snum;.        int ans;.        string meth;..        system.out.println(""please type method you wish to use:"");.        meth = taken.nextline();..        if (meth == ""+"" || meth == ""plus"") {.            system.out.println(""please enter the first number:"");.            fnum = taken.nextint();.            system.out.println(""please enter the second number:"");.            snum = taken.nextint();.            ans = fnum + snum; // this is the bit it misses even if the user goes through this method..            system.out.println(""the answer is "" + ans);.        } else {.            subcalc subcalcobject = new subcalc();.            subcalcobject.subcalculator();.        }.    }..}...like whats in the title my program does not + the numbers which is whats supposed to be done in the first statement and always subtracts no matter what method is chosen."
