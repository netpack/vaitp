"i want to limit the integer input for the scanner in a range i know that this sounds like a repeat question, but i did spend all day yesterday extensively searching on both stack and google and while there were different solutions out there (one in which i'm basing my own attempt on) i feel i've reached a point where i need some guidance with my code...i want to simply create a scanner that only accepts values 1 through 50. in my main method, i have the following:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class test {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.        int inputint = getinput(in);.        system.out.print(inputint);.    }..    public static int getinput(scanner in) {.        system.out.println(""enter the number of questions (between 1-50):"");.        int input = 0;.        while (true) {.            input = in.nextint();.            if(input &gt; 50 || input &lt; 1).                break;.            system.out.print(""invalid input.nenter the number of questions (between 1-50):"");.        }.        return input;.    }.}...it does not seem to give me the ""invalid input"" error whenever the input is higher than 50 or below 1. i've been trying to search for the past 2 days for a solution and every solution i've found had its own problems, and trying to solve each just dug me deeper and deeper into a hole. questions such as [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. i feel like at this point i can't figure this out without a little guidance."
