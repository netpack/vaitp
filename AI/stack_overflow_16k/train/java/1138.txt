"multiple class calculator i am trying to make a simple calculator using multiple classes.  i can make one in one class, but now i would like to try making one using two classes.  i am having trouble with calling some variables (fnum, snum, answer) from the operationclass..if i run the program as it's written now i get 0 returned for the answer..i tried making the variables fnum, snum and answer in operationclass public but that did not work..also i tried public class operationclass extends calculator.  that did not work either..i know i'm missing something very simple.  i just can't pin point it.  ..calculator class:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class calculator{..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        operationclass operationobject = new operationclass();...        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.        double userinput;.        int userchoice;..        system.out.print(""please enter the first number: "");.        userinput = input.nextdouble();.        system.out.print(""please enter the second number: "");.        userinput = input.nextdouble();.        system.out.println(""please select operation to perform:"");.        system.out.println(""1-addition"");.        system.out.println(""2-subtraction"");.        system.out.println(""3-division"");.        system.out.println(""4-multiplication"");.        userchoice = input.nextint();..        switch (userchoice){.        case 1:.            operationobject.addition();.            system.out.println();.            break;.        case 2:.            operationobject.subtraction();.            break;.        case 3:.            operationobject.division();.            break;.        case 4:.            operationobject.multiplication();.            break;.        }...    }..}...operationclass:..public class operationclass{..    double fnum, snum, answer;..    public void addition(){.        answer = fnum + snum;.        system.out.println(answer);.    }..    public void subtraction(){.        answer = fnum - snum;.        system.out.println(answer);.    }..    public void division(){.        answer = fnum / snum;.        system.out.println(answer);.    }..    public void multiplication(){.        answer = fnum * snum;.        system.out.println(answer);.    }.}"
