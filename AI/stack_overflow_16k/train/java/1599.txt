"blank: receives three numbers (short, int, long), the method must return the largest number basically my method must receive three different data types (short, int, long) and display the largest. however the method cannot translate them because i am using char, that is obvious but i don't know what else to use instead, i need a different way for cast those objects using 'return'...error msg: method in class cannot be applied to given types. required: short, int, long ..and yes, i need to use swing library... ..package homework;..import blankx.swing.joptionpane;..public class test {.    string result = null;..public static int addnumber(string title, string message){.    return joptionpane.showinputdialog(null, title,message, -1).charat(0); .}.public static void largest(short a, int b, long c) {..    if (a &gt; b) {.        system.out.println(a + "" is the largest number"");.    } else if (a &gt; c) {.        system.out.println(a + "" is the largest number"");.    } else if (b &gt; a) {.        system.out.println(b + "" is the largest number"");.    } else if (b &gt; c) {.        system.out.println(b + "" is the largest number"");.    } else if (c &gt; a) {.        system.out.println(c + "" is the largest number"");.    } else if (c &gt; b) {.        system.out.println(c + "" is the largest number"");.    }..    else {.        system.out.println(""wrong number"");.    }..}..public static void main(string[] args) {.   largest(addnumber(.
