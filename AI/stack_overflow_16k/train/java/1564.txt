"using one input data in two tasks is there a way to use one input data in two tasks? i have a program that has to check if an email matches a particular pattern and at the end if an email is correct the program prints it. in my case i have to write the email twice, one time so an email can be stored in a variable email = in.readline(); and the second time so it can be checked vname = in.readidentifier(); and i want to write it just once...out.print(""please enter an email-adress: "");.email = in.readline();.name = in.readidentifier();.if (!in.done()) {.    out.println(""error : false name"");.    return;.}"
