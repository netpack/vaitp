"bytestream problems i'm having a hard time trying to understand how this code is working. it's using a byte stream:..in = new fileinputstream(""xanadu.txt"");.out = new fileoutputstream(""x.txt"");.int c;..while((c = in.read()) != -1) {.    out.write(c);   .}...what i don't understand is the while loop. is the input stream working like an array where the index is being incremented, and that index is passed on to the output stream? ..if some one could explain it would be greatly be appreciated."
