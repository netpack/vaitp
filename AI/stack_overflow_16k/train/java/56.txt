"how would you write your own blank classes to inherit from both jfc and wfc classes? as we all know ""multiple inheritance"" is prohibited in blank and j#. however, you can implement multiple interfaces like runnable using blank and j#. so, how would you write your own classes to inherit from both jfc and wfc classes, and implement both jfc and wfc interfaces at the same time ? is something like that possible......? ..i know how to inherit jfc and wfc classes seperately and implement interfaces one at a time. could someone post a sample code ? i am reading john sharp's microsoft press book, and he says all that is elementary...... can anyone help ?"
