"read/write windows registry on 64bit win 7 using blank with jna i'm trying to read/write windows registry on 64bit win7 using blank. ..firstly, i tried jdk blank.util.prefs.preferences and its reflection usage. that is a good solution but it only supports reading/writing reg_sz type (string) value. ..unfortunately, i need to read/write reg_binary, so give it up. ..secondly, i tried jni registry. reading is ok, but writing usually fails because writing hklm needs administrator rights. i don't know how to get administrator rights in blank. ..finally, i tried jna (blank native access) an excellent project for working with native libraries and has support for the windows registry in the platform library (platform.jar) through advapi32util and advapi32. it's very good and simple to use. and writing registry needs no administrator rights. ..but how can i read/write 32bit registry (under wow6432node node) in a 64bit jvm on win7? ..by default, 64bit nodes are read/written in 64bit jvms, and 32bit nodes in 32bit jvms. ..but in a 64bit jvm, i want to read/write 32bit nodes(for example, hklm-&gt;software-&gt;wow6432node-&gt;odbc). how can i do that?"
