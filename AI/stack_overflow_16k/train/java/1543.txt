"take user input to select which variable to edit i'm trying to take user input to select the variable they want to edit.  say i have 10 variables, i want the user to be able to input ""row 1"" and that prompts them to change the value of that variable through another input.  i would post code, but i don't have any to post relating to this because i don't even know how to start. ..edit: i don't want to have something like this:..if (input == ""row 1"") {     .    r1 = scan.nextint();.}...as i'm dealing with a lot of variables and don't want to have to make a statement for ever single one."
