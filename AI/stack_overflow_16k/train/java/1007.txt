"text manipulation basic blank so i have a text document in a format like this:..80  egypt           12  1   0   0   13  0.81  qatar           7   4   1   1   13  0...i would like to read it in line by line and store the name of the country along with the highest number (which will always be the 5th number...however, when i do the following then i am getting an array out of bounds error because it isn't splitting the line up at all...     string st;.     while ((st = br.readline()) != null) {..    string[] temp = st.split("" "");..     system.out.println(temp[1]);..     }...edit:.reason is that they are tabs not spaces and can be fixed with:..st.replace(""t"", """");"
