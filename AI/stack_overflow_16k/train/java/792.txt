"if statement always returning true when comparing ints - lehmann algorithm/test i'm implementing a method that generates a number and checks if its prime using lehmanns method. i got it all working apart from my checking if it's prime. so n is the randomly generated number and prime is the result after running lehmanns algorithm. essentially if the result of it is 1 or -1 mod n then it might be prime. blank doesn't like negative module and -1 mod n will always be n -1 so i did the check like so: ..       int n = 7;.       int prime = 6;.    if(prime != 1 || prime != n - 1).    {.        system.out.println(""here"");.    }...now the issue is this is still printing ""here"" when it shouldn't even if i set prime to 1. i might just be tired because it's something simple i'm missing."
