"returned int always zero + how to use object from main method in sub-method i am trying to write a simple blank program for school that does the following:..gym membership: ""write code that will input the customerâ€™s age and number of months, and print the monthly rate and total amount to be charged. prompt the user for the appropriate input, and display a meaningful output message. make sure that the months are greater than 0 and the age is greater than 0.""  ..my problems are:  ...custmonths int is always getting returned as 0 and i don't know why.  .i can't seem to find a way to loop back to the start of my selectage method if the user gives bad input (negative number or zero). ...here is my blank code:..import blank.util.*;..public class gymmembership {.public static void main (string[] args) {.    //create test customer (customer0) via the constructor.    gymmembership customer0 = new gymmembership(70, 12);.    customer0.selectage(customer0.custage);.    customer0.printcustomer();.    customer0.getmonthlyrate(customer0.agenamed);..    //prompt user for two integer inputs to create customer1.    scanner scnr = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.println(""enter customer age, then number of months for contract: "");.    gymmembership customer1 = new gymmembership(scnr.nextint(), scnr.nextint());.    customer1.selectage(customer1.custage);.    customer1.printcustomer();.}..//the constructor.gymmembership(int custage, int custmonths) {.    this.custage = custage;.    this.custmonths = custmonths;.}.//instance variables .private int custage;.private int custmonths;..int monthlyrate;    .int childrate = 15;.int adultrate = 25;.int seniorrate = 20;..string agenamed;.public string selectage(int custage) {.    scanner x = new scanner(system.in);.    int age = custage;.    agenamed = ""badinput"";.        do {.            if (age &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; age &lt;= 18) {.                agenamed = ""child"";.            } .            else if (age &gt;= 19 &amp;&amp; age &lt;= 64) {.                agenamed = ""adult"";.            }.            else if (age &gt; 64 &amp;&amp; age &lt;= 120) {.                agenamed = ""senior"";            .            }.            else {.                agenamed = ""badinput"";.                system.out.println(""age must be a positive number between 1 and 120."");.                break;.            }   .        } while(agenamed.equals(""badinput""));       .    return agenamed;.    }..public int getmonthlyrate(string agenamed) {.    if (agenamed.equalsignorecase(""child"")) {.        monthlyrate = 15;.    } else if (agenamed.equalsignorecase(""adult"")) {.        monthlyrate = 25;.    } else {.        monthlyrate = 20;.    }.    return monthlyrate;.}..public void printcustomer() {.    if (agenamed.equals(""badinput"") != true) {.        system.out.println(""the customer is a/an "" + agenamed + "" and is "" + custage + "" years old."");.        system.out.println(""the customer is signed up for a "" + custmonths + "" month contract."");.        system.out.println(""the monthly rate is "" + monthlyrate);   .    }.    else {.        selectage(customer1.custage); //this is broken since i cannot access customer1 object from this ""printcustomer"" method..        }.    }.}...i realize i am very likely making some bad beginners mistakes here as well, but am not quite sure what they are."
