"unsupported major.minor version. possibility of recompiling jars i am new to blank so i dont know if my question makes sense. i have a jar which i got from another developer and this jar is compiled in blank 1.7 and i am using 1.6. so when i run this application, it gives me a unsupported major.minor version error. so,i would like to know is there a way that i can recompile the jar in 1.6 somehow? i cannot update my blank version to 1.7 because, the development system cannot be connected to internet...thanks"
