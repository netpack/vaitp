"modify blank source code file and add some lines of code i have a blank source file (for example)..public class jtest{  .  public static void main (string arg[])  .    { . . . . . }  .  public mytestmethod()  .    {  .    for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++)  .      system.out.println(i);  .    }    }  ...what i have to do is to write blank program that can modify source code of the above blank file, not the compiled class file..after the modification using that program, the output may be . . .    ..public class jtest{  .  public static void main (string arg[])  .    { . . . . . }  .  public mytestmethod()  .    {  .    for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++)  .      {                                    // { added to code  .         system.out.println(i);  .         system.out.println(""iteration"");  //new line added to code  .      }                                    // } added to code  . }  }  ...i think my question would be clear now. it is just an example of my task..which blank library/libraries could be used.  ..blankssist is helpful to modify the class file. it is a very easy and handy tool for bytecode editing but i have to edit the source code."
