"type casting int to double blank? i'm practicing debugging and there is a question that i'm unsure on, it's asking what is wrong and what can i do to fix it i read the book chapter on it but not specific enough. pasted from the book:..int a = 26.4.        ^.when you compile, this is the message: ..test.blank:8: possible loss of precision .int a = 26.4;..required: int .found : double .1 error ..i have a decent understanding on why there is an error, because of how double has a higher precedence than int and how an int cant necessarily store a double value...my question is, is there a way to type cast variable a into a double type? or is the only way to fix this by changing a from int to double?..thanks"
