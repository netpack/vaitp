"how to get an array table to print every other line? i have tried messing with different things and looking up but i may be using the incorrect wording. i am just wondering where the blank lines go within the indexing of arrays. thanks for any help/guidance...i'm wanting my output to look like:.course        hours    score   grade.cs121           4       98      a.// mine doesn't have this blank line.math161         3       55      f.// or this blank line.cs124           3       66      d...my last print statement:system.out.printf(""%-10s %d %5d %5cn"", courses[i], credits[i], scores[i], lettergrades[i]);"
