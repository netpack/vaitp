how to implement an abstract function from a super class with an interface in blank so i have a class that looks something like this:..public abstract class gameobject {..    public abstract boolean hasvalidlocation();..    //some more code that will use hasvalidlocation.}...and an interface:..public interface collidable {..    //some abstract references to functions of the game object..    default boolean hasvalidlocation() {.        //checks whether or not the the game object has  a valid locaton.    }.}...and i have a similar interface for notcollidable and would like to implement the abstract function hasvalidlocation from the game object with this interface:..public class gameobject1 extends gameobject implements collidable {.    //some code.}...but blank says that gameobject1 does not implement hasvalidlocation. i can't use 2 abstract classes since i already split gameobject in a dynamicgameobject and staticgameobject and those can both be collidable and not collidable...is there something i did wrong or an alternative solution that doesn't require me to write hasvalidlocation() multiple times?
