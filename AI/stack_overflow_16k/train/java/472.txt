"how to to return null if none selected in a method? for example..private arraylist&lt;book&gt; books;.private int indexofselected;...i'm not sure if setindexofselected() is correct, but it's supposed to set the index into the list of selected books...public void setindexofselected(int indexofselected) {.books.set(indexofselected, getselectedbook());...and i need this method to return null if no book was selected, i'm not sure how to continue?..public book getselectedbook() {.}...i tried using a if statement but it gave me a error of unreachable code"
