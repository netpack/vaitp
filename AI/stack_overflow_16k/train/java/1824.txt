"blank - store objects in a hierarchy that follows their class inheritance i need to store lots of objects that belong to different classes:..classa {...}.classa1 extends classa {...}.classa2 extends classa {...}.classa2a extends classa2 {...}.classb {...}...now i need to find a way to store all these objects in a way that allows me to efficiently get all objects that belong to a particular class and its inherited child classes. for example, this imaginary code..getobjects(classa2)...would return a list of all stored objects that belong to classa2 or classa2a...i believe a tree collection of some sort would be suitable, but i can't think of any way to implement it. any ideas?....(background: i am creating a simple blank game, in which there's number of sprites that i need to manage, while some of those sprites share similar properties. when i check for events like collisions, i need to get all objects that extend enemysprite and compare their coordinates with the player's sprite.)"
