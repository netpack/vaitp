"how do i get continuous user input? i need a help trying to set my code to continuously receive user input for factorial numbers. it will produce a question and intake the user input but only once. i want it to continue asking the user for that input.  ..i tried to do a while loop however nothing shows up. ..import blank.util.scanner;.public class factorialrecursion.{..    public static void main(string[] arg).    {.            scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.            long userinput;..            system.out.println(""please enter a number you would like find the factorial of."");.            userinput = scan.nextlong();.            long fc = factorialrecursion.fact(userinput);.            system.out.println(""factorial = "" + fc);.    }....    public static long fact(long x).    {.            if (x &lt;= 0).                return 1;.            else.                return factorialrecursion.fact(x - 1) * x;.    }..}...the output is correct but i want my program to continue asking for that input."
