"how to get the binary values of the bytes stored in byte array i am working on a project that gets the data from the file into a byte array and adds ""0"" to that byte array until the length of the byte array is 224 bits. i was able to add zero's but i am unable to confirm that how many zero's are sufficient. so i want to print the file data in the byte array in binary format. can anyone help me?"
