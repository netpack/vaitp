"does blank have a default value return like blankscript? i was wondering if blank have a ""default value assignation"" (i really don't know how to call it) like what you can do in blankscript or python. ..for example in js you can do this: ..var myvar = variable || ""default value"";...and if variable contains a value, myvar will have the value of variable otherwise myvar will be the string ""default value""...also in python you can do this: ..a = ""hello"" .b = a or ""good bye"" .print b #this will print ""hello"" .a = none.b = a or ""good bye"" .print b #this will print ""good bye""...can you do this something similar in blank? usually when i have to do this in blank, i do something like this: ..string a = b != null ? b : ""default value"";...but i think what you can do in js or python it's much more readable. also can you tell me what's the ""name"" of this ? i know the || symbol it's an or operator, but how it's called when you do this ""defaultvalue"" thing..thanks"
