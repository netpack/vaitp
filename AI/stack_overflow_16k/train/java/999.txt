"difference between string s="" "" and string s=null i wrote the program to reverse the string..string original = ""hello"";.string rev = """";.for (int i = original.length() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {.    rev += original.charat(i);.}.system.out.println(""reversal:"" + rev);...the output is : reversal:olleh..but, when i rewrite string rev="""" as string rev =null..i get the output as reversal:nullolleh..what is the difference between null and """" character?"
