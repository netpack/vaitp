"instance variable thought to be missing method so my goal is to create a method for both the pagesread() instance variable and the typehomework instance variable, but when i try this, i get an error saying that they are missing method or to declare abstract. if someone could help me figure this out or send me to another question similar that would be wonderful, thank you...public abstract class homework {.    public int pagesread();.    public string typehomework();.    public abstract void createassignment(int p) {.        return null;.    }.}"
