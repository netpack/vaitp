"why can i use .equalsignorecase(""anoterstring"") without assigning it to a variable or within a control flow statement? i came across this code:..    for (final string s : mylist).    {.        s.equalsignorecase(test);.        updateneeded = true;.        break;              .    }...i suspect that this is not what the programmer actually wanted to do. i believe he meant to write something like:..    for (final string s : mylist).    {.        if(s.equalsignorecase(test)).        {.            updateneeded = true;.                break;.        }   .    }...however, i don't understand why there is no error in the first code snippet. .. s.equalsignorecase(test);    ...since the method .equalsignorecase(""anoterstring"") returns a boolean and it is not being assigned to anything or used within a control flow statement"
