"how do i use charat to check if the string doesn't start with a a-z or a-z? else if (!stremail.touppercase.charat(0) &lt; 'a' || !stremail.touppercase.charat(0) &gt; 'z').        {.            joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, ""must start with a through z or a through z"");.        }...i tried doing that but i kept getting an error message. should i just use charat alone? am i better off using indexof to check if the string or email starts with a letter lower case or upper. i was thinking combining index and char, but i tried that, and it didn't work."
