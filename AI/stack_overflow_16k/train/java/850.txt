"is this creating 12 string objects? i'm trying to understand if this code below creates 12 objects for a string like ""stephan""..public string reverse(string str) {.            if ((null == str) || (str.length()  &lt;= 1)) {.                return str;.            }.            return reverse(str.substring(1)) + str.charat(0);.        }...this recursively reverses a string. i understand how it works. but i was thinking if there is a relationship in this case between the length of the strings and number of string objects created through concatenation?"
