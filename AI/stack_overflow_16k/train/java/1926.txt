"numberformatexception for input string: ""9646324351"" here's a snapshot of a problem on leetcode:....for this problem, they provide this framework code you have to fill in:..public int reverse(int x) {.}...when testing solutions, it seems to provide an unreasonable input and won't let me submit my solution. the error is:....note that the input is 1534236469. that fits in an int as input, but the reversed version, 9646324351, naturally doesn't, as the max positive value of an int in blank is 2147483647...is this just an error in the leetcode test? or is there some trick i can't imagine that magically lets me return 9646324351, a clearly out-of-range value, back from reverse as an int?..here's my code, but the code almost doesn't matter, as the return type (int) is fixed by the problem (so by ""integer"" they really mean int, not long):..public int reverse(int x) {.    string intstring;.    stringbuilder sb = new stringbuilder();.    if(x &lt; 0){.        sb.append(""-"");.        x = x * -1;.    }.    intstring = integer.tostring(x);.    for(int i = intstring.length() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--){.        sb.append(intstring.charat(i));.    }.    string resultstring = sb.tostring();.    int result = integer.parseint(resultstring);.    return result;.}"
