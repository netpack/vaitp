"look for an element in a 2d array using contains i have a 2d array and want to use contains method to check if mychar is part of myarray[i][0]..public static final string[][] myarray = {.        {""nm1"", ""desc1""},.        {""nm2"", ""desc2""},.        {""nm3"", ""desc3""},.        {""nm4"", ""desc4""},.        {""nm5"", ""desc5""}.    }..arrays.aslist(myarray).contains(mychar);...however this is failing for me. when i make it as 1d array like: ..public static final string[][] myarraynm = {.    ""nm1"",.    ""nm2"",.    ""nm3"",.    ""nm4"",.    ""nm5"".}..arrays.aslist(myarraynm).contains(mychar);...is working for me. is there a way i can do the value check using 2d array (loop will be the last option)"
