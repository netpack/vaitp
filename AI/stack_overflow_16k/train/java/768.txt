"a program that contains employee data if employee tenure is more than three years call all functions in main (in blank) i am writing a program in blank that contains variables to hold employee data like...employeecode.employeename.employeedateofjoining...i have written a function that assigns user defined values to these variables that i mentioned above. in variable employeedateofjoining i store values like 3-3-2019. after this, i want to write another function that asks the user to enter the current date and then checks if the employee tenure is more than three years or not. if an employee's tenure is more than 3 years than call the functions otherwise not....package assignment;.import blank.util.scanner;.import blank.util.calendar;.public class employeedata {..    string employeename, employeecode, dateofjoining;.    scanner input=new scanner(system.in);.    calendar c1=calendar.getinstance();.    public void employee_data().    {.    system.out.println(""enter the employee name:"");.    employeename=input.nextline();..    system.out.println(""enter employee code:"");.    employeecode=input.nextline();..    system.out.println(""current date:""+(c1.get(calendar.month)+1)+""-"" .    +c1.get(calendar.date)+ ""-"" +c1.get(calendar.year));.    }.    public void checkdate().    {.    system.out.print(""enter his date of joining --&gt; - should be used and all entries must be integer:"");.    dateofjoining=input.nextline();..    }.}...this is main class ..package assignment;..public class assignment {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        employeedata e1=new employeedata();.        e1.employee_data();.        e1.checkdate();.    }.    }...if i enter date like 21-3-2019 then it should subtract this from current date and should show me output in this format e.g 22-3-2018"
