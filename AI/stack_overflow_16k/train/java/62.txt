how to sort a string array in alphabetical order without using compareto? i’m trying to sort through a string array of names. i have two different string arrays for first names and last names and i’m trying to sort through them in alphabetical order without using any kind of array sorting. is there any kind of way to tell blank whether we want our string array going from increasing to decreasing order?
