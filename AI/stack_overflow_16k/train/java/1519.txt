"write a method to return number of words in a string? edited write a method called wordcount that accepts a string as its parameter and returns the number of words in the string. a word is a sequence of one or more nonspace characters (any character other than ' '). for example, the call wordcount(""hello"") should return 1, the call wordcount(""how are you?"") should return 3, the call wordcount("" this     string has     wide       spaces "") should return 5, and the call wordcount("" "") should return 0...ok so my problem is that when a string/phrase word input by the program begins.with a space rather than a word, it doesn't register the following words in the sentence and returns value 1. ..so if the wordcount is(""   this string    has   wide spaces"").which should return 5 but  is only retiring 0. i don't get why can you help me understand where i messed up?..here is my method:..   public static int wordcount(string s) {.          int word = 0;.          if(s!=null).          if(s.charat(0)!=' ') {.              word++;.          }.          for(int i=0; i&lt;=s.length(); i++) .          {.          if(s.charat(i)!=' ' &amp;&amp; s.charat(i+1) ==' ') .          {.                word++;.          }.              return word;.        }.           return word;.    }"
