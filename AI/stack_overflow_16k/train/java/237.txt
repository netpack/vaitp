"optimizing variable check in blank i have been working the codingbat exercises lately and here is my solution for one of the problem..public boolean makes10(int a, int b) {.  return (a == 10 || b == 10 || a+b == 10);.  } ...the code itself works but i am wondering if this code can be optimised further since the 2 variable (a and b) both check if they equals to same value.i am referring to a == 10 || b == 10"
