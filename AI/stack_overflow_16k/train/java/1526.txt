"blank scanner, delimiters, and end of line i have a data file with slash-delimited ints on multiple successive lines..here's a little piece of code that i'd like to use to read and print all those ints:..import blank.util.scanner;.import blank.io.file;..class testing {.   public static void main (string[] args) throws exception {.      scanner file = new scanner(new file(""data.txt""));.      file.usedelimiter(""/"");.      while (file.hasnextint()).         system.out.println(file.nextint());.   }.}...data file one looks like this:..1/2/3.4/5/6...output from data file one looks like this:..1.2...data file two looks like this:..1/2/3...output from data file two looks like this:..1.2.3...can someone explain why i'm getting this behavior?  in particular, why does the first example ignore the presence of the ""3"" at the end of the first line of data?..note: i know several ""better"" ways to get my desired behavior: read the whole line at once and use split() and parseint(), read the whole line at once and turn it into a separate scanner object, etc.. that's not my question.  i'm trying to understand why this particular piece of code doesn't work as intended --- in particular, why i get less data when the file has more lines."
