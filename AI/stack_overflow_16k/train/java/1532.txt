"why the arraylist is not initialising with runtime input? i'm currently working on blank collection framework , and created a list of size 10 still the program prompting me that the list size is 0, further if list processed it throws indexofboundexception of course..i've searched about this but i don't know why it's happening to me..    int size =sc.nextint();.    list&lt;integer&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;(size);   .    system.out.println(list+"" ""+list.size());...i expect the output as [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] 10 but output is [] 0 ."
