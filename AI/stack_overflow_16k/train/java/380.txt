"blank file compiles with having mismatching directory location and package declaration i am facing an odd issue. blank source file is under /home/gftrelv204/lib_build/sfw.24/src/log/logger.blank, but in the file itself (logger.blank), the package declaration is com.giftssoft.fts.log..strange thing is, thatlogger.blank` file compiles successfully. i was expecting compiler to complain about the directory structure not matching the package declaration...$ blankc -encoding cp1252 ./src/log/logger.blank.$..$ head -1 ./src/log/logger.blank..package com.giftssoft.log;"
