how can i change the apparent type to a real type in blank? for example :  ..public static string s(object o).    return o;  ...this method doesn't work/compile. to solve it i can write return o.tostring() but i don't want that. i want to change the apparent type of o which is object to the real type of o which is i know it is string..how can i do that? i know there is a command that i can use it but i forget it. anyone know it?  ..thank you
