"overwriting a row in a two dimensional arraylist i have a 2d arraylist containing 4 cols. i want to add a 5 th column to this arraylist..the fourth col is a set of values based on which the result is to be added as the 5th column..if 1st row has 4th element as 0 then the fifth column will have a result string ""failure""..is it ok to use a 1d arraylist to get all the elements of the 2d arraylist and add the 5th element to it and then overwrite the 2d with the 1d arraylist items .or.is there a way we can directly append to the 2d arraylist using the index() and indexof()?..will appreciate it if someone can help me out with this."
