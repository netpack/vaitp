"is this a scenario where an exception thrown by a try block can be swallowed? i have a try block like so:..exception thrownexception = null;.try {.  puke(); // throws exception.} catch (final exception everything) {.  thrownexception = everything;.  // do some other stuff, wrapped in try/catch blocks to prevent accidental shadowing.  // now throw the thing.  throw everything;.} finally {.  if (thrownexception != null) {.    // do some other work here, taking care to swallow/log exceptions that might come up.  }.}...my impression is that the everything exception will be thrown, and callers of the method in which this construct exists will see it...we have a test in place where this does not seem to be the case (i.e. only various log messages hint to us that an exceptional condition was encountered; the everything exception effectively disappears from existence).  if we're right, this would seem to be a major bug in jdk 8, so i have my doubts...what am i missing?"
