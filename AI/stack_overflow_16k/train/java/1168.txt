"why is my message printing twice when i break out of the inner if? i am having a little problem with my code. compiling and running works well, however, when i attempt to break out of the inner loop,..system.out.println(""type which category you want to add to."");.system.out.println(""homework, classwork, labs, test, quizzes, midterm, final"");...the code above is printing twice to the terminal when i only want it to print once...i have a feeling that is a simple mistake with the way my brackets are aligned but i am having difficulty with figuring out how to do it. any help would be greatly appreciated!..import blank.util.scanner;..public class getgrade {.    public static void main(string[] args) {..        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        final int max = 15;..        int[] homework = new int[max];.        int[] classwork = new int[max];.        int[] lab = new int[max];.        int[] test = new int[max];.        int[] quizzes = new int[max];.        int[] midterm = new int[max];.        int[] fin = new int[max];.        int hwcount, clcount, labcount, testcount, quizcount, midcount, fincount;.        double hwtotal, cltotal, labtotal, testtotal, quiztotal, midtotal, fintotal;.        double grade = 0;..        string selection = """";..        system.out.println();.        system.out.println(""welcome to getgrade!"");.        system.out.println();..        while (true) {..            system.out.println(""type which category you want to add to."");.            system.out.println(""homework, classwork, labs, test, quizzes, midterm, final"");.            selection = input.nextline();..            if (selection.equals(""homework"")) {..                system.out.print(""what percentange of your grade is homework? &gt; "");.                double hwpercent = input.nextdouble();.                system.out.println(""now begin typing your grades. when you are finished, type -1."");..                for (int i = 0; i &lt; homework.length; i++) {.                    homework[i] = input.nextint();.                    hwtotal = homework[i] * hwpercent;.                    grade += hwtotal;.                    if (homework[i] == -1) break;.                }.            }.        }.    }.}"
