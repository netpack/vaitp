"hailstone blank program i am working on the hailstone sequence program in which the user picks a positive integer. if number is even, it will be divided by two. if the number is odd, it'll be multiplied it by three and added by one. the program will continue until the number is equal to 1. the program will also tell the user the amount of steps it took to reach 1...the goal is to be done recursively, my issue is that i am unable to declare each step to the user as the calculation happens to the number, for e.g ""number is so i divide by 2 and it = ""..this is my code so far, any suggestions or alternatives will help...thanks..import blankx.swing*..{.   public class hailstone {.   static int count;.   static int hailstonenumbers(int num).   output += (num + "" "" ) ;.   joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, output);..    if (num == 1 &amp;&amp; count == 0) {.        return count;..    }.    else if (num == 1 &amp;&amp; count != 0) {.        //n-1.        count++;.        return count;.    }.    else if (num % 2 == 0) {.        count++;.        hailstonenumbers(num / 2);.    }.    else if (num % 2 != 0) {.        count++;.         hailstonenumbers(3 * num + 1);.    }.    return count;...}..public static void main(string[] args).{.    int num = integer.parseint(joptionpane.showinputdialog(""n enter a positive number""));.    int x;..    x = hailstonenumbers(num);...   joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, ""number of steps"" + x );.}...}"
