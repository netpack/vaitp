"key to value associations what i am trying to do is create cars, assign a name to each car created. ..below is what i have done:..//.....codes.. public class cars {..        map&lt;string, vehicle&gt; vehiclenames = new hashmap &lt;string, vehicle&gt;();.        car car = new car();.        private void execute(string[] instructions).        {..           boolean blnexists =vehiclenames.containskey(instructions[1]);.           system.out.println(""exists? : "" + blnexists); ..             if (blnexists){.               if (instructions[1].equals(""build"")){.                   car.makevisible();.                  }.              }.              else {.                  system.out.println(""does not exist yet!"");.              }..//more codes..........the problem i am facing:..the program compiles and works fine, car names are being stored in the hashmap as i wanted. but the cars created don't seem to be associated to their respective names."
