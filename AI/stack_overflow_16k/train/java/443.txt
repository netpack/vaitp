"how do you access a private integer (declared in a nested class) from a method within the starter class? i've seen lots of questions about accessing private methods, but none about accessing private integers, so i figured this was worth asking. basically, i have my main class, runnystack, with a private nested class called run. inside run, i initialized a private integer, length, and i'm trying to access this private int from a method inside runnystack. ..i've already tried searching up this problem (for too long), and the answers i found don't work for me, because (per class instructions) i need to declare length as a private int inside run. this means (from what i've tried) i cannot do 'run hello = new run();"", because it says 'the constructor runnystack.run() is undefined'. i also tried 'runnystack.run len = new runnystack.run();', but it just said 'the constructor runnystack.run() is undefined'..    class runnystack&lt;base&gt; {.private class run {.    private base base;.    private run next;.    private int length;..    private run(base base, run next) {.        this.base = base;.        this.next = next;.        this.length = 0;.    }.}...this code shows the creation of the nested private class, including the private integer length...    public void push(base base) {.    if(isempty()) {.        top = new run(base, top);.    }.    else {.        if(base == top) {.            length += 1;.        }.    }.}...this code shows the method i'm trying to access length in..all i want to do is access length so that i can increase it whenever the if statement is fulfilled..any help is appreciated, thanks!"
