"is there a cleaner way to loop and capture the object ids to a list? say i have a collection of users:..list&lt;user&gt; users = ...;...now i want to get all the id's for the users in a list, currently i am doing:..for(user user : users) {.  userids.add(user.getid());.}...is there a more elegant way of doing this?..i know blank doesnt' support linq, so maybe this is the only way but just thought i'd ask."
