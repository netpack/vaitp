"path lists blank 6 in blank_home, but why does cmd use blank 7 for blank while blankc uses blank 6? i have both blank 6 and 7 installed for compatibility reasons.  right now, i need to use blank 6 but i don't want to uninstall blank 7.  i looked carefully at the path and replaced blank 7 with the path to blank6 in blank_home.  closed and restarted another cmd window.  blank 7 is 64 bit and blank 6 is 32 bit...currently,..blankc gives 1.6  which is what i expect, however, i'm not sure why blank -version gives 1.7.  how do i make it so that on windows 7 command prompt, when i type blank - version, it would give blank 6 instead?..i renamed the blank 7 folder, and when i type blank, i get this error:..c:>blank.error: could not open `c:program filesblankjre7libamd64jvm.cfg'..i thought the path would dictate what version of blank will be used...thanks."
