"using a loop to invoke multiple methods i am newish to blank and trying to building a small rocket program. ..i have 3 distinct methods that change the size and colour of the rockets exhaust jet on the graphical display when invoked which work great individually...public void pulse1().{.    jet.setdiameter(6);.    jet.setcolour(oucolour.red);.    jet.setxpos(58);.}..public void pulse2().{.    jet.setdiameter(12);.    jet.setcolour(oucolour.orange);.    jet.setxpos(55);.}..public void pulse3().{    .    jet.setdiameter(24);.    jet.setcolour(oucolour.red);.    jet.setxpos(48);.}...however, what i am trying to do is code another method ignition() that uses some sort of loop to invoke each of the three pulse methods in that chronological order a maximum of 5 times with a 500 millisecond delay between each call. (the idea being to simulate on the graphical display the firing up of the rockets engines)..thus far i have tried the following without success...public void ignition().{.    pulse1();.    delay(500); // uses the inbuilt delay method.    pulse2();.    delay(500);.    pulse3();.}"
