"blank.awt.color return color name not rgb value before anyone marks this as a duplicate, i read about 7 other questions that were similar and none of them had answers anywhere close to what i'm looking for. i also ventured past the first two pages of google search results and still couldn't find an answer...i don't care about all the colors in the world, i just want to use the ones that are already in the blank color class (i.e ""red"", ""black"", ""green"")...i'm writing a program for an intro blank class and the professor said to declare ""a private color data field named guitarcolor that defines the color of the guitar. the default value should be color.red."" his example output shows the color returning as ""getcolor(): red"". so i need to use the color class to get the output in this format. ..when i use the blank.awt.color class and input something like color.red, i want it to return ""red"", not ""blank.awt.color[r=255,g=0,b=0]"". how can i do this?..import blank.awt.color;..public class program.{.    public static void main(string[] args) {..    guitar g1 = new guitar(); ..    system.out.println(""getcolor() result: "" + g1.getcolor());..    }.}...public class guitar {    ..    private color guitarcolor;..    public guitar () {.        guitarcolor = color.red;.    }..   public color getcolor() {.       return guitarcolor;.   }...} ...output: ..getcolor() result: blank.awt.color[r=255,g=0,b=0]"
