"get the directory of the current file i have two projects: a and b. project b has a maven plugin, and when this is executed it should take some templates, which are resources of project a. ..the templates are located in c:/path/to/project/a/module1/src/main/resources/templates...the method that retrieves these templates uses velocity engine and the method is in a class located in c:/path/to/project/a/module1/src/main/blank. i use the following path for the templates: ..string path = new file( """" ).getabsolutepath() + file.separator + ""src"" + file.separator + ""main"" + file.separator + ""resources"" + file.separator + ""templates"" + file.separator;..in my unit tests this path is equal to c:/path/to/project/a/module1/src/main/resources/templates, but when i run the maven plugin from project b, this path is equal to c:/path/to/project/b/module1/src/main/resources/templates. i realize this is because i launch from project b. i know if i put my templates in project b that it works but that's not what i want...what i would like to achieve is to let the path always be equal to c:/path/to/project/a/module1/src/main/resources/templates. however, since other people are also using this project and their path to project a is most likely different from mine i cannot just do ..string path = ""c:/path/to/project/a/module1/src/main/resources/templates"". ..so i would like to keep the first part in such a way that the path to project a is found, followed by ""src/main/resources/templates"". is this possible and if yes, how?..edit to clarify: what i want is to get the path to project a from a method a1 that is inside project a. and this path to project a should also be found when i run method a1 from project b. the problem that i have with how i am retrieving the path right now is that when i run method a1 from project b then i get the path to project b...solution it is working when i use the classpathresourceloader (instead of the fileresourceloader)."
