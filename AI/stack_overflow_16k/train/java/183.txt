"most efficient way to test if number falls within certain 22.5 degree range of 360 degree circle i am building a compass, and need to return a different string for the cardinal direction depending on what 22.5 degree interval the user is currently in. ..for reference, please look at this picture...here is a sample of my current code:..if ((azimuth &gt;= 348.75 &amp;&amp; azimuth &lt;= 360) || (azimuth &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; azimuth &lt;= 11.25)).{.    return ""n"";.}.else if (azimuth &lt; 348.75 &amp;&amp; azimuth &gt;= 326.25).{.    return ""nnw"";.}...this series of else if statements continues in 22.5 degree intervals until all cardinal directions are covered. is there a more efficient way to do this? currently, android studio/intellij is giving an error message saying this method is too complex to analyze by data flow algorithm. regardless of the error message, i think there might be a more elegant way to do this, but i can't think of it at the moment. ..any ideas? thanks!"
