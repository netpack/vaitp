"how to make have a if statement run after a nested for loop is complete? i am wondering if there is a way to run a if loop after a loop is complete without removing it from the loop.this is the program i have to do for my com sci class..write a program that finds the integer from 1 to 1000 with the most factors. for example, 60 has.12 factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. keep track of the number of factors for each.integer from 1 to 1000 in the nested for. when the nested for is done, you program should know.which integer has the most factors. use a separate for loop to output each of the factors..this is the code i have..public class program45{.    public static void main(string args[]){.        int count=0,count1=0,num1=0;.        for (int num=1; num&lt;=1000; num++ ){.            for(int facnum=1; facnum&lt;=num; facnum++){.                if(num%facnum==0){.                    count++;.                }.                if(count&gt;count1){.                    num1=num;.                    count1=count;.                    count=0;.                }.            }.        }.        system.out.println(num1+"" has the most factors"");.        system.out.print(""they are "");.        for(int facnum1=1; facnum1&lt;=num1; facnum1++){.            if (num1%facnum1==0){.                system.out.print(facnum1+"", "");.            }.        }.    }.}...already tried putting second if statement in a nested if."
