"system.currentimeinmillis() vs system.nanotime() i know that system.nanotime() is now the preferred method for measuring time over system.currenttimeinmillis()  . the first obvious reason is nanotime() gives more precise timing and the other reason i read that the latter is affected by adjustments to the systemâ€™s real-time clock. what does ""getting affected by systems real-time clock "" mean ?"
