"does child class call overiding method when calling indirectly through parent? if method in class a calls parent method in class b which calls method x in class b which is overridden in class a, which implementation of method x will be called? the overridden implementation in child class a or the original implementation in parent class b?..from my code, i see that the override method is called, but i imagined that if a method was called from a class, the method would not be the overriding method in a subclass. i guess if a subclass calls a method in the parent which calls a method which is overridden in the subclass, the overridden method will be called? is that right? why?"
