"calendar.setfirstdayofweek does not work i want to get the week of the month for a specified date. for example for today(sunday sep 14 2014), the result should be 2. for tomorrow(monday sep 15 2014), result should be 3...so i do this :..calendar cal = calendar.getinstance();.cal.setfirstdayofweek(calendar.monday);.cal.settime(mydate); // mydate is a date object with the specified date.cal.get(calendar.week_of_month);...but this gives me the result 3 for today and tomorrow. what am i doing wrong?"
