"use regex to match a^xb^x, where x is the number of times a,b appear to clarify, i want to know how to use a regex to match:..ab.aabb.aaabbb .......i just found out that this works in perl: ...if ($exp =~ /^(a(?1)?b)$/)...to understand this, look at the string as though it grows from the outside-in, not left-right:..ab.a(ab)b.aa(ab)bb...(?1) is a reference to the outer set of parentheses.  we need the ? afterwards for the last case (going from outside in), nothing is left and ? means 0 or 1 of the preceding expression (so it essentially acts as our base case).  ..my questions is:  what is the equivalent of (?1) in blank?"
