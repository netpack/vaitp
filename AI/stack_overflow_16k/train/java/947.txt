"converting char array into a string i am making a hangman game. i have two char arrays and i need to check if they are equal...one of them has letters and underscores: char checkletter[]..the other one has only letters: char currentword[]..eventually, after the user has guessed all the words in the checkletter[] array it will also consist of only letters. but i need to keep continually checking (in a boolean method) if the array into which they guess and their letters get stored, is the exact same as the word they are trying to guess...if i could convert both of the arrays into strings then i could check them for equality. i am not experienced, and i don't know how to do this. any help help would be appreciated!"
