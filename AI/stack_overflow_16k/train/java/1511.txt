"simpledateformat incompatible types i have to build a program where administration can call onto things of a certain period (choosing a start and end date and the period would be in between those). ..deciding wether a date falls in between the period to actually show the right information i want to convert a string to a date and then to milliseconds...my code is as follows:..public class customer.{.// instance variables.private string consumer;.private order order;.private string date;../**. * fill in the name of the consumer and the order number.. * fill in the date/day in dd-mm-yyyy formate please.. */.public customer(string consumer, string date, order order).{.    // initialise instance variables.    this.consumer = consumer;.    this.order = order;.    this.date = date;.}../**. * get the startdate. */.public void getdate().{.    simpledateformat sdf = new simpledateformat(""dd-mm-yyyy"");.    date newdate = sdf.parse(date);.}...now i get the error ""incompatible types; you wrote a string where an int was expected.). isn't it supposed to convert a string? why does it expect int? the error lies on the ""sdf.parse(date);"" part...any help would be awesome."
