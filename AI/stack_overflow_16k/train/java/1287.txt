"blank - utilize avail data structure or create new data structure my question is that when do we need to create new data structure and when should we use built-in data structure...assume, i have to read a file. based on pattern matching, i have to get 3 properties. i.e propertya, propertyb, propertyc..after gathering these 3 properties from 5 files, i have to write to a database...option1:..create a reader which reads a file will return a map or json..class which calls reader will receive returned datastructure. in this case, it is either map or json...i will create another map in the caller class map&lt;stringfilename, mapreturneddata&gt;...if i get all the data from all the files, i will populate it into database...option2..instead of map or json create user defined class with 3 properties and its getters and setters...which one we have to use? if both are same, when we have to use user defined and built in?"
