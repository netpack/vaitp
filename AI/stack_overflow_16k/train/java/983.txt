"netutils blank library - how to make it work? i'm trying for a while to use a library in blank that i found a few months ago for edit packets..the library is ""like"" jnetpcap but much richer, and most important seems to be newer and less buggy....here is the open source homepage of the project:.https://code.google.com/p/netutils/downloads/detail?name=netutils_toturial.pdf&amp;can=2&amp;q=.in the manual the person who wrote this library said we need to use ""libnet.lib"" and ""netutils.dll"" files..i'm not really sure how to make it work, it seems to have a problam with the ""netutils.dll"" when trying to run a simple code..hope to get an answer from someone. thanks a-lot."
