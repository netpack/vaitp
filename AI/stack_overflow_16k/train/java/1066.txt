"reading lines with bufferedreader i am trying to read information from a file to interpret it. i want to read every line input. i just recently learned about bufferedreader. however, the problem with my code is that it skips every other line. ..for example, when i put in 8 lines of data, it only prints 4 of them. the even ones. ..here is the code:..import blank.io.*;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class examanalysis.{.  public static void main(string[] args) throws filenotfoundexception, ioexception.  {..    int numofq = 10;..    system.out.println();.    system.out.println(""welcome to exam analysis.  let’s begin ..."");.    system.out.println();.    system.out.println();..    system.out.println(""please type the correct answers to the exam     questions,"");.    system.out.print(""one right after the other: "");.    scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.    string answers = scan.nextline();..    system.out.println(""what is the name of the file containing each student's"");.    system.out.print(""responses to the "" + numofq + "" questions? "");.    string f = scan.nextline();.    system.out.println();..    bufferedreader in = new bufferedreader(new filereader(new file(f)));.    int numofstudent= 0;..    while ( in.readline() != null ).    {.      numofstudent++;.      system.out.println(""student #"" + numofstudent+ ""'s responses: "" + in.readline());.    }.    system.out.println(""we have reached “end of file!”"");             .    system.out.println();.    system.out.println(""thank you for the data on "" + numofstudent+ "" students. here is the analysis:"");.   }. }. }...i know this may be a bit of a bad writing style. i am just really new to coding. so if there is any way you can help me fix the style of the code and methods, i would be really thrilled. ..the point of the program is to compare answers with the correct answer. .thus i also have another question:..how can i compare strings with the buffered reader?.like how can i compare abcced with abbbde to see that the first two match but the rest don't. ..thank you"
