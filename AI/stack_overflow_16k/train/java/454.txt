how can i make a flow diagram of my program i have a very large server program written in blank. it was written by another developer who is no longer with the company and is very complex...it is made up of 23 packages and i use eclipse. ..what i want is a program that will take the source files of my program and create a kind of flow char for the functions. start with the class that has main and follow it through which classes it calls in its constructor. ..basically i have learned that the program uses interfaces heavily and i want a visual representation of how the server functions instead of tracking through several four line function in interfaces before i get to the real processing function. a flow chart type thing would allow me to see where the function call would end up...does anyone know of any program available that could do this for me ?..i don't really mind what format the visual representation is in as long as it is easy to follow.
