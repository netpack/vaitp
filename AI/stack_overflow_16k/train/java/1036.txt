"blank schedule generator not outputting enough i am working on a blank sports schedule generator , and my issue is that it is not generating enough games, i have it (i think) set for 32 days and one game per team per day, yet for some reason never outputs that many, varying between 17-29. i've gone through this several times, and i still can not figure out the problem. please help!.this is what i have so far: thanks in advance!..    public class fourthirtytwosched {.//who has the team played and how many times.static int[][] scheduleplayed = new int[4][4];..//has the team played today?.static int[][] playedtoday = new int [32][4];.public static void main(string[] args) {.    //initiate random objects.    random rand = new random(4);.    random replace = new random(4);.    //sets the arrays.    //column = reference team.    for(int i = 0; i &lt; scheduleplayed.length; i++){.        scheduleplayed[i][0] = 8;.        scheduleplayed[i][1] = 8;.        scheduleplayed[i][2] = 8;.        scheduleplayed[i][3] = 8;.    }.    for(int j = 0; j .            &lt; 32; j++){.        playedtoday[j][0] = 1;.        playedtoday[j][1] = 1;.        playedtoday[j][2] = 1;.        playedtoday[j][3] = 1;.    }..    //initiate time.    int day = 0;..        while(day &lt; 32){.        while((playedtoday[day][0] + playedtoday[day][1] + playedtoday[day][2] + playedtoday[day][3]) != 0){..        int vs = 0;.        int team = 0;.        vs = rand.nextint(4);.        team = rand.nextint(4);.        //ensure random is valid.        while(playedtoday[day][vs] == 0 || scheduleplayed[vs][team] == 0 || playedtoday[day][team] == 0){.            vs = replace.nextint(4);.            team = replace.nextint(4);  }            .        if (playedtoday[day][vs] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; scheduleplayed[vs][team] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; playedtoday[day][team] &gt; 0){.            //only prints if not bye.            if (true) {.            system.out.println(team + "" v.
