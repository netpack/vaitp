"does class method and class variable belongs to class object in blank? below two points are mentioned in blank doc:...""class objects are constructed automatically by the blank virtual machine as classes are loaded and by calls to the defineclass method in the class loader.every instance of the class shares a class variable, which is in one fixed location in memory. any object can change the value of a class variable, but class variables can also be manipulated without creating an instance of the class....my question is: does class method and class variable belong to ""blank.lang.class"" object in blank?"
