int compareto(object obj) i have to make a method that will pass an object as a parameter and compare two mystring objects...int compareto(mystring anotherstring)....return -1 if this object is less than the parameter object..return 0 if the two mystrings match.return +1 if this object is greater than the parameter object...i also have to make one that will pass a string and compare it to the object and one that will compare two objects and ignore the cases. the catch is that i have to not duplicate code. a pseudo code would be helpful but an explanation of what i'm doing wrong and an example would be most obliged...     public int compareto(bigstring ob).     {.         bigstring comp;.         for(int i =0;i &lt; size;i++)...         if(thatarray[i] &gt; comp.thatarray[i]).         {.             return 1;.         }.          else if( thatarray[i] == comp.thatarray[i]).          {.             return 0;.          }.           else if( thatarray[i] &lt; comp.thatarray[i] ).           {.             return -1;.           }.     }
