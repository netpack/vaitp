"how to get a looping program in blank i am new to blank programming and i wanted to try to make a calculator. i made the code, but the only problem is that it will only run once. i was wondering if there was any way to get it to ""loop"". by that i mean, add a question to go to the beginning of the main method that way i can run the calculator again. here is the code i have.....import blank.util.scanner;..public class calculatorfull {.    public static void main(string[] args){.        int op;.        double num1, num2;.        scanner operation = new scanner(system.in);.        system.out.println(""1 - addn2 - subtractn3 - multiplyn4 - divide"");.        system.out.print(""which operation would you like to perform?   "");.        op = operation.nextint();..        if((op != 1) &amp;&amp; (op != 2) &amp;&amp; (op != 3) &amp;&amp; (op != 4)){.            system.out.println(""that wasn't an option..."");.        }else{.            system.out.print(""first number:   "");.            num1 = operation.nextdouble();.        system.out.print(""second number:   "");.            num2 = operation.nextdouble();...            if(op==1){.                add(num1, num2);.            }else if(op==2){.                sub(num1, num2);.            }else if(op==3){.                mult(num1, num2);.            }else if(op==4){.                div(num1, num2);.            }.    }.}..public static void add(double x, double y){.        double numsum;.        numsum = x + y;.        system.out.printf(""%s + %s = %s"", x, y, numsum);.    }..    public static void sub(double x, double y){.        double numsum;.        numsum = x - y;.        system.out.printf(""%s - %s = %s"", x, y, numsum);.    }..    public static void mult(double x, double y){.        double numsum;.        numsum = x * y;.        system.out.printf(""%s * %s = %s"", x, y, numsum);.    }..    public static void div(double x, double y){.        double numsum;.        numsum = x / y;.        system.out.printf(""%s / %s = %s"", x, y, numsum);.    }.}...thanks in advance for the help!..btw, i think this might be different from this question (user input to repeat program in blank). i have different methods that i call from and that was changed to call from the main to just 1 method. don't know if that changes any of the solutions or if it is the same problem but thank you for pointing out that it might be."
