"passing list<string> as a parameter i have a function ..public class playermanager {.    public playermanager(list&lt;string&gt; players){.    //something to manipulate the player list...    }.    private static class playernode {.      public string name;    .      public playernode next;.      //....    }.}...what i need is to create playernode(it works like a linkedlist) in the constructor based on the data in the player list.  what comes to my mind is to create an array and then iterate it and create the playernode list:..string[] playerarray = players.toarray(new string[players.size()]);...but the assignment requirement says i can't construct any arrays, arraylists, linkedlists, stacks, queues, or other data structures. ..so my question is if i can not create any class implemented list interface. how can i handle the data in it?..thanks"
