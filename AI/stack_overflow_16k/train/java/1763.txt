"how to determine if a jre is 32/64bit from folder structure/files i have a jre folder on a windows system. is there a way to determine if the jre is 32-bit or 64-bit from looking at the files within?..to clarify, i have multiple jre folders and i want to investigate each. ..this is not a duplicate of the suggested duplicate. i wish to know which arch the jre is designed for, not the arch of the machine it is installed on"
