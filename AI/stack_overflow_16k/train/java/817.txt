"blank autoboxing and unboxing issue blank compiler takes care of casting primitive data types and their wrapper classes..but my doubt is that although blank compiler performs type casting all by itself, why is it that it prints an error when i try to convert an array to arraylist with int array as parameter..like:..int[] val = {1,2,3,4,5};.arraylist&lt;integer&gt; newval = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;(arrays.aslist(val));....  error: no suitable constructor found for arraylist(list&lt;int[]&gt;)...why is the compiler not casting int to integer?"
