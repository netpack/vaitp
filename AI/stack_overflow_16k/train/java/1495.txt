"why is this ""if"" a ""dead code""? i have the following code :    ../** width of each brick in pixels */.    private static final int brick_width = 11; ../** width of each brick in pixels */.    private static final int brick_height = 12;../** number of bricks in the base of the pyramid */.    private static final int bricks_in_base = 14;..public void run () {..    int lowerleftside;.    if (brick_width / 2 == 0).    {.         lowerleftside = ((getwidth()/2) - (brick_width*(bricks_in_base/2)));.    }else .         lowerleftside = ((getwidth()/2) - (brick_width*(bricks_in_base/2-1)));...eclipse marks the whole if as dead code. i initialize the value at the very beginning of the run method. ..thanks."
