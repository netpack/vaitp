"make threads per list item i am new to blank concurrency and not really comfortable with examples provided by the docs..what i am trying to do is, i have a database of employers which i retrieve their credentials from the database and store it in blank.util.list. i want to perform independent actions of each employee stored in the list concurrently. is multi-threading the right direction ? and could i be guided with some pseudo example ? ..n:b if my question is vague, comment so i may improve it rather than downvote.it's important i understand how i could accomplish this. thanks"
