"checking if a triangle is a right triangle i'm trying to check to see if a triangle is a right triangle in blank..this is a portion of what the tester class does:..    triangle a = new triangle(new point(2, 2), new point(6, 2), new point(2, 6) );.    system.out.println(a.isright()); //expects true...a portion of my triangle class receives the values and sets them to x1,y2 etc:..    public triangle(point loc1, point loc2, point loc3) {.    x1 =  loc1.getx(); y1 =  loc1.gety();.    . . ....the first two segments of code were given to me. i am to make the last segment of code which i made to be this:..    public boolean isright() {.        if((math.pow(side1,2)+math.pow(side2,2)) == math.pow(side3,2)).            return true;.        if((math.pow(side2,2)+math.pow(side1,2)) == math.pow(side3,2)).            return true;.        if((math.pow(side3,2)+math.pow(side2,2)) == math.pow(side1,2)).            return true;.        else.            return false;.    }...however, it still returns false. what am i doing wrong?.thanks a bunch!..update:.thanks for the help. i seem to have made a rather noob-ish mistake. i never thought about the fact that doubles weren't really accurate (sorry, just trying to say what i did in simple terms). i ended up inputting this:..        if(math.abs(side1*side1 + side2*side2 - side3*side3) &lt; 0.2).        return true;.    if(math.abs(side1*side1 + side3*side3 - side2*side2) &lt; 0.2).        return true;.    if(math.abs(side3*side3 + side2*side2 - side1*side1) &lt; 0.2).        return true;.    else.        return false;...once again, thanks for the help!"
