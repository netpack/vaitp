serviceloader load - duplicate class which loads first? when using serviceloader.load(x.class) and there are 2 jar files which contain definitions for x.class which one will get deployed?..the issue i'm seeing is that this appears to be intermittent in terms of class load order. ..this is a issue as the definitions are slightly different...ideally this would only appear once on the class path and avoid all problems but in the intermediate time i'm trying to understand whats loads first.
