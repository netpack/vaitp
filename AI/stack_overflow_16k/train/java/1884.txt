"difference between setting the runtime option using -d option when starting the application and setting using system.setproperty what is the difference between the following two ways of setting property? ...while starting the application, e.g. blank - cp /usr/bin/*.jar -d blank.file.path=/home/export..system.setproperty(""blank.file.path"",""/home/export"")...when i use the first method to set a path for 3rd party api, it's working fine, but the second method does not work."
