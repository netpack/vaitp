"what is the recommended way to copy or move a file from a local to nfs directory? file.renameto fails over nfs mounts so i'm using the commons.io fileutils class's movefile method. occasionally it throws an ioexception when moving a file however that file correctly shows up in the nfs mount. i'm assuming there is a race condition between when fileutils checks to make sure the file was moved and nfs saying that's a valid file. ..what is the best way to ensure a smooth file move over to an nfs mount in blank?..file f = new file(""test.log"");.fileutils.movefile(f, new file(newdir, f.getname));"
