"code not printing when trying to find numbers that are both star and triangular numbers im trying to write the code for a program that prints values that are both star and triangle numbers. although the code just doesnt seem to work and wont print out any values, the function for the starnumbers is working fine although i think that the function for the triangle number is a bit iffy, im not really sure where the problem is. ..all help would be greatly appreciated .thanks..public class triangularnumbers {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        int n = 1;.        int i = 1;.        int star = starnumbers(n);.        int triangle = trianglenumbers(i, n);..        while (star &gt; 0).        {   .            while (star &lt; triangle).            {.                n++;.                star = starnumbers(n);.            }.            while (triangle &lt; star).            {.                triangle = trianglenumbers(i, n);.            }.            if (star==triangle).            {.                system.out.println(star);.            }.        }.    }.    private static int starnumbers (int n) {.        int s = ((6*n)*(n-1)+1);.        return s;.    }.    private static int trianglenumbers( int i, int n){.        int star = starnumbers(n);.        int t = 0;.        while (t&lt;=star).        {.            t = t + i;.            i++;.        }.        return t;.    }.}"
