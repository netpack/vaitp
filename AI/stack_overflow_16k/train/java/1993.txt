"is it possible to not repeat a timedtask until the old one has finished? i have a timed task which could take some time to perform its task, sometimes more than the interval i set...timer.schedule(new connectioncheckerthread(), 0,interval);...i see that if a thread is still in its run() method another thread is executed after interval..i don't want that. i'd like that another thread starts just when the previous one finished...is it possible?"
