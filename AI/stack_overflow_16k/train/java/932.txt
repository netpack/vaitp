"how to make blank program detect changes to a file? i have program that reads and displays the colour in a jlabel, based on its input supplied by a input.txt file. .my doubt is that, is my program is able to  read the updates supplied by the input.txt file?..the input.txt is file supplied by linux keeps updating o/p will be either 0 or 1...0 - display red..1 - display green....i am able to read very clearly &amp; display the output. but if the input is changed by any means manual/auto this program needs a restart to display this change in the input."
