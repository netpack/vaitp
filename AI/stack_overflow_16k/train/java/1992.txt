"is there a way that i can compare an array and an arraylist? is there a way that i can compare an array and an arraylist like..if (array[0]==arraylist[0])...i am working on this problem:..string[] s= {""a"",""a"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""c""};.arraylist&lt;string&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();.list.add(""a"");.list.add(""b"");.list.add(""c"");.// create a new arraylist that stores the frequency of each character. .// for example, ""a"" appears twice in s, so newarraylist[0]=2; ""b"" appears .// three times, so newarraylist[1]=3, and so on....my idea is using a loop to scan through the string array and every time when a letter in it equals the letter in list, int count++. but i dont know how to compare things in an array and things in an arraylist."
