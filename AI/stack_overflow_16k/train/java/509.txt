"how do third party jar to exe conversion affects software sorry if it feels a noobish question. my doubt is, if i converted a jar file to .exe file using software, such as exe4j or launch4j, will it still require a jre enabled system to be able to run it, or will it just run like normal windows executable?..also, i wanted to know if there is any other way to convert jar files to exe without using 3rd party software, also, are there any side effects of converting a jar program to exe."
