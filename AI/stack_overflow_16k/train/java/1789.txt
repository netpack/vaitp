"blank: weird behaviour during white space seperation of a string i have 2 strings. i am trying to understand why the ""test"" string that contains a sequence of numbers with a white space is ignored by the test.split(); function while the ""test2"" is working as expected...    string test = ""2Â 703,8"";.    string test2 = ""bla bla 2 703,8"";..    string[] tests = test.split(""\s+"");..    for (string s : tests) {.        system.out.println(s);.    }..    string[] tests2 = test2.split(""\s+"");..    for (string s : tests2) {.        system.out.println(s);.    }.....what i am actually trying to do is somehow make the number ""2 703,8"" appear without the space. i have tried to use the replaceall(); function but that did not work."
