"blank parsing date and time with simpledateformat i have this input:..thu may 31 01:43:45 gmt-8 2018...these are the most recent patterns i have tried:..""eee mmm dd hh:mm:ss zx yyyy"".""eee mmm dd hh:mm:ss 'gmt'x yyyy"".""eee mmm dd hh:mm:ss zx yyyy""...i get an unparseable date exception thrown when i try parsing the input using the patterns.  i have tried several patterns but can't figure out  how to match the gmt offset portion of the input.  i can do this with  regular expressions - i don't really need the offset but would rather figure out what pattern to use.  of course the offset could also be a 2-digit offset if it's more than 9 hours from gmt...i've looked at the simpledateformat documentation and several examples here and other places but can't figure out the correct pattern i need."
