"objectinputstream invalid stream header when i'm using this shipet:..inputstream fs=new fileinputstream(""some_file.txt"");.objectinputstream is=new objectinputstream(fs);...the blank shows error:..&gt;blank.io.streamcorruptedexception: invalid stream header: 3130300a.at blank.io.objectinputstream.readstreamheader(objectinputstream.blank:857).at blank.io.objectinputstream.&lt;init&gt;(objectinputstream.blank:349)...fileinputstream works fine. datainputstream works too..the code runs in main method, and there are not any another code. i used another file, for example pom.xml, the error remained the same...i can use datainputstream instead of objectinputstream, but i don't understand the cause of such behavior."
