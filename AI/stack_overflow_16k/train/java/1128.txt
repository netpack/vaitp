"can't call validation methods in blank i have this problem, i created two methods that validate the users input. then i am trying to get their input to validate before the rest of the program is run. it won't work and i can't find any thing online that will help...i did it in another program the exact same way, yet it won't work in this one. any help would be much appreciated...(the main section is commented out because i was trying to get it run).....    import blank.util.*;.....public class guessinggame {../**. * @param args. */.public static void main(string[] args) {.    // todo auto-generated method stub....    int answer;.    int tries = 0;.    answer = (int) (math.random() * 99 + 1);....    system.out.println(""welcome to the guess the number game "");.    system.out.println(""+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ n"");.    system.out.println(""i'm thinking of a number between 1-100 "");.    system.out.println(""try to guess it!
