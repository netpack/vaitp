"when does scanner.nextline() block? i'm using a scanner for my socket connection in a client/server program...i want scanner.next() to block so the server thread can wait for something to read...however, it sometimes gives me:..blank.util.nosuchelementexception: no line found.    at blank.util.scanner.nextline(scanner.blank:1585).    at cscie55.hw4.server.serviceclient(server.blank:146).    at cscie55.hw4.server.main(server.blank:106)...the blank documentation says that next() ""sometimes"" blocks, and it doesn't say whether nextline() blocks...some code online wraps it in an if that tests for null, but i read that it never returns null. what should i do to get blocking io working properly in my socket?..specifically,..when does scanner.nextline() block rather than throw nosuchelementexception?"
