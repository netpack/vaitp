"what really happens when loading a class in blank? i'm confused with the process of loading a class. what is the order in which members of a class are executed?..see the following:..class l {..    static void fr(){.        a=1;.        b=3;.        a=b;.    }..    static{.        a=3;.        b=1;.        a=b;// here the problem:cannot reference a field before it is defined.    }..    static int a;.    static int b;..    public static void main(string args[]) {..    }.}...whenever i move the declarations of a and b to the top before the static block, compilation works fine. so i need to understand how this stuff works to resolve the problem above."
