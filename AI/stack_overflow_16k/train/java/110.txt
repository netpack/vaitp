"pipedreader.ready() does not throw exception when writer is already closed i am using the method ready() of pipedreader to avoid blocking for input, but unfortunately if the writer has gone this method is not throwing an ioexception (contrary to method read(), but this one is blocking)...what are the alternatives? is there a non-blocking way to check that the writer has gone?..ps: i suppose this is a bug in ready(), because read() returns -1 when the writer has gone, but ready() keeps returning false."
