c++ pointers to pointers in blank i am a blank noob.  i have been able to grasp the concept of converting c/c++ pointers into blank references and this has gone fairly smoothly...i hit a piece of code that has pointers to pointers (ie **ptr).  i need to dereference the pointer and change the value of the pointer it is pointing to (ie  *ptr = &newthing;)..this seems alot tougher in blank.  does anyone have any ideas on how to solve this issue?  quick google search turned up nothing...here's a code example in c++.  i want to get something similar working in blank but the ptr_to_ptr variable is a problem:..struct _coord.{.   int x;.   int y;.   _coord * next_coordinate;.} coordinate_t;   ..coordinate_t buffer[100];.coordinate_t * head;.coordinate_t ** ptr_to_ptr;..if (wednesday).{.    ptr_to_ptr = &amp;head;.}.else.{.    ptr_to_ptr = &amp;head-&gt;next_coordinate;.}.*ptr_to_ptr = &amp;buffer[3];   // &lt;&lt;&lt;---- how do you make this work?
