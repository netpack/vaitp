"strategy pattern elevators i'm doing an application for school which consists in simulating the job of the elevators in a building using the strategy pattern. ..so i have the class building which has an arraylist of floors and another one of elevators. each floor has a button to call an elevator and there are 4 elevators and 16 floors. ..what i need to do is apply the strategy pattern in order to decide what elevator should move to which floor. ..any ideas of how this might work? ..i've tried to create an observer for each floor so when the button was pressed, the observer was notified, but still i dont know how to make the strategy to choose wich elevator should go to each floor :s ..if you need the code i'll try to translate it, i made the mistake of programming the variables on my native language, and that's not english as you can see."
