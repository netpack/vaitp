"i have trouble with static main method and inputting non-static values i am working on a school project, building a chess-game. i have my board which creates the arrays and fill the board with pieces. ..now, i want to instantiate a new board in a game class and use the console to input player moves. to make this as simple as possible, my trouble is inputting non-static variables...for instance:..public class test extends consoleprogram{..public static double a1;.. public static void main(string[] args) {.    a1 = readline(""insert value of a1""); .    system.out.println(a1);. }.} ...more info on readline() here..as you probably see, this won't work as blank is complaining cannot make static reference to the non-static method readline()..how do i work around this? maybe there is something really basic i just don't understand....as always, thank you very much for your quick and insightful answers!"
