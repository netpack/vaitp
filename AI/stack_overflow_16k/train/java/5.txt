"formatting column output in blank i have the below output from a loop in blank, i would like to know as to how to set the gap between the columns so the output looks neat...name[last,first]:cruise, tom     movie:mi    year:1990s     .name[last,first]:hanks, tom     movie:cast away     year:2000s   ...i want the movie and year to be aligned along the same line. i have used three methods getname() , getmovie, getyear() to obtain data."
