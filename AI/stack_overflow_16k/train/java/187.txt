"blank: instantiated object variable error i have a problem that i'm afraid is very simple, yet i can't figure it out even with the help of lectures and tutorials...i have this piece of code to create a class with some variables:..public class symbol.{.    public string sign;.    public boolean win;.}...i then want to instantiate the class as an object and set its variables to a certain value like this:..symbol x = new symbol();.x.sign = ""rock"";.x.win = true;...i did this exactly like the lecture i took said, but still i get the following error: ..""&lt;identifier&gt; expected""..what am i doing wrong? there was no identifier declared in any example i looked at..i am breaking my head over this for several hours now and - as embarresing as that is - i am at my wits end. please help...on a side note: i am using bluej to compile and run the code - if that is of any relevance...thanks a lot"
