"i am try to take a string and rebuild it with two random int values i created to swap two chars at those positions public static string jumble(string s) {.  int length = s.length() - 2;.  random r = new random();.  int n = r.nextint(2)+1;.  int a = r.nextint(length)+1;.  string s1 ="""";.  if (s.length() &lt; 4) {.     s1 = s1 + s;.  } else if (s.length() == 4) {.     s1 = s1 + s.charat(0);.     s1 = s1 + s.charat(2);.     s1 = s1 + s.charat(1);.     s1 = s1 + s.charat(3);.  }.  while (n == a) {.     a = r.nextint(length)+1;.  }.  if (0 &lt; n &amp;&amp; n &lt; a &amp;&amp; a &lt; s.length()) {.     s1 = s1 + s.substring(0,n) + s.charat(a) + s.substring(n + 1, a) + s.charat(n) + s.substring(a+1,s.length());.  } .  system.out.println(s1); .  return s1;...this is my requirement ..string jumble(string): accepts a string and returns a jumbled version of the original: for this method, jumbled means that two randomly chosen characters other than the first and last characters of the string are swapped; this method must use the class, random. the method must swap two different characters: in other words the two random indices into the string cannot be equal, cannot be 0, and cannot be equal to the string’s length minus one. so, for example, a four-letter string must result in the returned string having the same first and last characters and have the second and third characters swapped. examples of what this method might do: “fist” returns “fsit”, “much” returns “mcuh”, but for longer strings there will be more possible return values: “spill” could return “splil” or “sipll”. only one pair of letters should be swapped and strings shorter than four characters are returned unchanged. when the string length is greater than 3, the original string must never be returned...i have to use random class and can only use the string class methods of length, charat, and substring. this is what i have so far, i really need help creating the last string when it is greater than 4 and i need to use the random numbers i made...edit: i have got my code working better now, thanks to ursa.  the problem i have now or at least i think it is a problem is that some times the code does not always print or return anything."
