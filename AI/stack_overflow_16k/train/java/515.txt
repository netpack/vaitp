"trying to write a months class for a calendar class in blank. ok so for a big lab i have to do the first part is to write a calendar class just like the one i've written here. this was pretty simple because we got really direct instructions on how to do this. i'll show it in case that helps with the problem:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class calendar .{ .    static final int february        = 2;.    static final int months_per_year = 12;..    static int [] dayspermonth = .        {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};..    static string [] months =  .        {"""", ""  januray"", ""february"", ""   march"", ""   april"",.             ""      may"", ""    june"", ""    july"", ""  august"", .            ""september"", "" october"", ""november"", ""december""};..    public static void main(string[] args) .    { .        scanner in = new scanner(system.in); .        system.out.print(""enter the year? (yyyy): ""); .        int year = in.nextint(); ..        int firstday = firstdayofyear(year);..        // february: check for leap year    .        dayspermonth [february] = isleapyear(year) ? 29 : 28; ..        for (int i=1; i &lt;= months_per_year; i++) {.            month month = new month(dayspermonth[i], firstday);.            system.out.println(""nn      ""+months[i]+"" ""+year);.            month.printmonth();.            firstday = month.getfirstdayofnextmonth(); .        }.    }..    private static boolean isleapyear(int year) {.        return ((year%4 == 0) &amp;&amp; (year%100 != 0)) || (year%400 == 0);.    }..    private static int firstdayofyear(int year) {.        return (2 * (13) + (3 * (13+1)/5) + (year-1) + ((year-1)/4) .                - ((year-1)/100) + ((year-1)/400) + 2) % 7;.    }.}...ok so that's the first class. the part i'm really having trouble even getting started with is writing a ""months"" class. i've created the class and i keep trying to start setting up different methods and doing things like that but i really just can't seem to grasp the concept of how exactly to set up something in one class, so that it works for another class...here's the exact thing the months class has to do: the month class that you have to define must contain the following state and behavior:..state.the number of days in the month (an integer between 28-31).the first day of the month (an integer between 0-6, sun=0, mon=1, tues=2, wed=3, thurs=4, fri=5, sat=6)..behavior.a standard constructor with two parameters to set the state of the month directly..a method that returns the day that the next month should start on..a method that prints out the calendar for that month using a loop. that is, you should not just have 28 different sets of println() statements that print the calendar out directly...i have a really hard time doing some things in blank just because i'm just learning the language. please don't suggest that i go read a blank book or something like that because i've done that and this is still just a foreign language to me. any help with this would be greatly appreciated, i'm not saying answer it for me by any means, just maybe give me suggestions on how to do it...here's what my months class is so far ..import blank.util.*;.public class month {.    scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);.    public static void month(int dayspermonth, int firstday) {.        dayspermonth = months_per_year.    }.}...and that's just completely wrong. i keep trying different things with the month method like static int, no static, and different things on the inside, but nothing will allow me to not get an error which is very frustrating. sometimes blank is very annoying because my professor is awful and doesn't actually teach how to write code at all, just things about how computers work."
