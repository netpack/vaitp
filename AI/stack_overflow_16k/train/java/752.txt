"calling a method in a class in each other method i have a method that i want to be called each time one of the other methods is called.  i dont want to have to explicitely call it each time.  is there a way to have the other methods naturally call that method before executing its own code?..if i have a method thats called isthere() and i want it called in each other method, i dont want to have isthere() written in each method.  i was hoping there would an easier way to do this."
