"how to get math.random() with a unit step i am trying to create a snake game where i have 400x400 pane and the snake moves by 20 at x and y axis. by doing this i have created a grid that has step of 20 at x and y axis. ..i want to randomly spawn a fruit at the pane but i want the width and height to be in grid so it should spawn at steps of 20 (0, 20, 40, 60 , 80, ... , 400)...i can use math.random()*400 to get range but i cant give it unit step...i found this question which is exactly what i asked but the solution is for lua based math.random():.math.random function with step option?..here is how i translate the snakes position:..if (input.equals(keycode.w.tostring()) || input.equals(keycode.up.tostring())).    if (snakes.get(0).gety() == 0).        movement.stop();.    else.        snakes.get(0).sety(snakes.get(0).gety() - 20);...*snakes is an arraylist of rectangles that expand as it eats food and i want only the head to eat the food.*food is a circle that spawns at random location..and here is how i check if they come in contact:..if (food.getcenterx() == snakes.get(0).getx() &amp;&amp; food.getcentery() == snakes.get(0).gety()).    score++;.setscore();...i move my snake over the food but the x and y position don't ever match unless i spawn food myself at the grid (say [20,40] or [60, 200])...is there another alternative or random with unit step or some other question that i couldn't find here at stackoverflow that can help me?"
