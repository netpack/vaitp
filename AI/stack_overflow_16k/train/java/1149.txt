"passing function as arguments from one class to another i have a class called helloworld where i create an object of class test test = new test();..then in the helloworld class i have my main function and another:..public static int passme(){.    system.out.println(""running this function"");.    return 1;.}...this is function im trying to pass. i pass it int test using the following:..test.getsomefunction(new callable&lt;integer&gt;(){.              public integer call(){.                  return passme();.              }.          });...inside test class i have:..    public void getsomefunction(callable&lt;integer&gt; somefunction){.        system.out.println(somefunction);.    }...now all this works, but passme() isn't being run, rather i don't know how to reference it..if i print out somefunction, i get: ..""helloworld$1@35a8767""...so my question is how do i go about running the function i got passed in, if i do somefunction() i get error message ""he method somefunction() is undefined for the type test"""
