"what does @override mean in this blank code? .  possible duplicate:.  when do you use blank&#39;s @override annotation and why?.  blank, what does @override mean?  .....i was checking out drools planner example source code and i came across code like this:..@override.protected solver createsolver() {.    xmlsolverconfigurer configurer = new xmlsolverconfigurer();.    configurer.configure(solver_config);.    return configurer.buildsolver();.}..protected solver createsolverbyapi() {.    // not recommended! it is highly recommended to use xmlsolverconfigurer with an xml configuration instead..    solverconfig solverconfig = new solverconfig();..    solverconfig.setsolutionclass(nqueens.class);.    .....truncated.....    solverphaseconfiglist.add(localsearchsolverphaseconfig);.    solverconfig.setsolverphaseconfiglist(solverphaseconfiglist);.    return solverconfig.buildsolver();.}...as far as i understand createsolver() and createsolverbyapi() are supposed to return solver objects when you explicitly call them...what does the @override mean here? what is the general meaning of the @ term?....edit: my very bad; i inadvertently duplicated what does @override mean?"
