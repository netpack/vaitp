"throwing checked exception in blank let's say i am designing an api for storing passwords. according to effective blank it is a good idea to use throw clauses to show checked exceptions, however by having a throw clause that throws a sqlexception, which is a checked exception, then i am revealing the underlying implementation details of my api and thus i will be unable to change the implementation details of my api at a later stage. one of the pros to throwing a checked exception is that the programmer who uses the api should be able to handle the exception in a manner of their choosing. which of these two methods should i choose to do, add a throw clause which reveals the implementation or hide it or use a different approach?"
