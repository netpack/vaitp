"convert .class to .blank i have some .class files that i need to convert to .blank so i did:..blankp -c classname.class...and all the time i have the same error...  error:could not find classname.class...do you guys have any idea of what might be the cause? i did man blankp and as far as i know the syntax is correct. if there is another way to convert it to a .blank file, i am more than willing to try. any idea is greatly appreciated?"
