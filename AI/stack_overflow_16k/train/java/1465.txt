"how to improve technical skills while working in support projects i am  working on a support blank project, which was fully developed years ago and now in maintenance phase. i just completed one year in it but don't feels like i gain any technical skill. we spent most of the time in checking server logs and making minor changes. .as now a days most of the project are in maintenance phase it's really difficult to get core development work. so how can i improve my technical skills while working in support?"
