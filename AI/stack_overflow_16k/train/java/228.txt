"there is methodx in interface i, class c1 & c2 use the exact code of methodx, so where to put the logic into methodx? (blank) ok, i have class c1 &amp; c2, both already extends other class..public class c1 extends m{.    public double calcost(double price, int qty){.        return price*qty;.    }.}..public class c2 extends n{.    public double calcost(double price, int qty){.        return price*qty;.    }.}...in fact, my calcost is very complicated, so i don't want to duplicate the exact code calcost cos it very difficult to maintain...so, i knew we need to use interface like..interface calculation{.    public void calcost();.}...&amp; then we do like public class c1 extends m implements calculation &amp; public class c2 extends m implements calculation, but then we still have to duplicate the same logic of calcost in c1 &amp; c2. so,..where to put the logic of calcost so that we don't need to duplicate?..other solution is using utility static methods but this is not good for unit test as someone said."
