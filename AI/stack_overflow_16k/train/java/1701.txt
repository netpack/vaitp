"why are the printstream ""out"" and inputstream ""in"" null? out of curiosity i was looking through the source code for some of the blank api classes found at docjar.com. i saw the blank.lang.system class and saw that the printstream ""out"" (i.e., system.out) had the following code:..public final static printstream out = null;...and in the comments it says:..the ""standard"" output stream. this stream is already.open and ready to accept output data....my queston is, i know final variables can't be modified, so why is it null when declared? why doesn't blank throw a nullpointerexception when a method for ""out"" is called? the same goes for system.in as well...thanks for any clarification."
