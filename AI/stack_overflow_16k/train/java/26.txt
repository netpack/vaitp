"how to convert xmlgregoriancalander to epoch-time or other fixed integer ? is there a library that will allow me to easily convert the blank type xmlgregoriancalander to epoch time (the number of seconds since 01-01-1970 00:00:00?)? or any other fixed integer for that matter? ..if not, is there some neat, boiler plate code to do this? .this seems like too common a use case to be writing from scratch... ..thank you very much for your answers."
