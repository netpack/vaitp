"should a variable be created when an object is created merely to call a single method? imagine a scenario where we need to create an object only for a single method call. which of the following is a better coding practice and why:...putting the object in a variable:..foo foo = new foo();.int val = foo.getval();...advantage: in case of exception handling we could isolate exceptions in constructor vs those in getval() function..disadvantage: an extra variable..calling the method directly on the result:..int val = new foo().getval();...advantage: no need to have an extra variable lying around..disadvantage: if an exception occurs, it's more difficult to determine whether the constructor or method threw it."
