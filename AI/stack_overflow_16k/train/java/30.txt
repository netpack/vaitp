usage of connection object in blank i have a requirement that involves me to call aroung 30 -40 separate functions housing sql queries and update and/or insert..in this case how can i get the connection object..am i suppose to create at one place and pass the connection object to all the 30 functions  or do i create the connection object in the function itself..there are many updates happening in these queries in separate functions and time is of the essence..so how do i create the connection object and use the same connection object over and over again without creating a new one.
