"blank - trouble accessing valuemap i've got a pretty simple script that simply accesses a resources properties via a valuemap. except for some reason i keep getting an unexpected token error were the if statement starts. this has to be something i'm just overlooking. ..public class headercomponent{.  valuemap property = resource.adaptto(valuemap.class);.  if(property != null) {.    pageheader = property.get(""pageheader"", """");.  }.}...any ideas? thanks for the help."
