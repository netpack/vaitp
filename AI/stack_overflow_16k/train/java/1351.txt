"what is the proper way to pass 'this' to an inline overridden method of a new object? i used a local variable to store this in order to make it accessible inside an inline overriding but not feeling happy about that. is there a more elegant way of doing that?..public class tree extends plant {.    public tree() {.        timeline = new timeline(new keyframe(duration.millis(40), new eventhandler&lt;actionevent&gt;() {.        final plant tree = this; // &lt;---- here.            @override.            public void handle(actionevent actionevent) {..                tree.seta(5); // &lt;---- and here.            }.        }));..        timeline.setcyclecount(timeline.indefinite);.    }.}"
