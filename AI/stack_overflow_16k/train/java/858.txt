"accessing observable list in another class let's say i have a class:..public class futuretask extends task&lt;observablelist&lt;future&gt;&gt; {.   @override protected observablelist&lt;future&gt; call() throws exception.     observablelist&lt;future&gt; futurelist = fxcollections.observablearraylist();.     .....     /// a bunch of things here to build and manipulate the list.     .....  return futurelist;...if i had another class..public class {.// what would i enter here to get a variable x so:.x = futurelist?...i tried doing observablelist&lt;future&gt; x = futuretask.call() but i keep getting a static reference error...futuretask is only used once in the code, so would i have to declare it static?"
