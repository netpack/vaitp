"storing an array so that i can access it the next time i run the program i have this array ..string[][] somearrayofdata={{""there"",""is""},{""alot"",""of data here""}};...i want to be able to save this array so i can load and access it the next time i run the program..i dont mind having to use just a string[] as well. i have tried to write it to a notepad file but that is just a major irritation, is it possible to store variables externally to avoid the hassle of writing to multiple notepad files or using delineators?"
