"why would use map<string,object> instead of hashmap<string,object> i always initialize map like map&lt;string,object&gt; hsmap = new hashmap&lt;&gt;().(assuming hashmap key is a string and value can be any object) ..instead of ..hashmap &lt;string,object&gt; hsmap = new hashmap&lt;&gt;()..as a best practice ,though i'm sure that i will never change this map implementation apart from hashmap for my requirement...is ther any other reason to initialize with 1st approach apart from being a best practice to code to interface ?"
