"having error in bluej library the problem is this (import blank.*;)..i've been watching some tutorials in youtube about frames and etch. and ive been copying his code. i wonder why this happens only in me. i use bluej for my ide and the error says package blankx doesnt exist. please help me. thank you!..well, blank.* ; doesnt exist? what's the problem? the guy no youtube has no problem running his code and i copied it carefully without mistake. the only error i get is the line 1 which is: import blank.*; same as the guy on youtube."
