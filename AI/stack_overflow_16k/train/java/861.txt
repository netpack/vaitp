best approach to parse bytearray or bytebuffer in blank i have a bytearray /bytebuffer  contains a information about a record ( with different datatypes).  what would be the best approach to parse them into individual fields...example :   record size is  100 bytes.                  field 1 is  integer .                  field 2 is  timestamp .                  field 3 is  short integer.                  field 4 is  $ amount in  decimal.                  field 5 is  string (remaining bytes )
