"configuring in-memory or embedded database to test production code i have a requirement where in i have to test a dao blank class in production code using an in-memory database. the dao performs insert operation using a different connection configuration. ..i tried configuring hsql embedded database which comes with spring but looks like it needs programmatic configuration setup within the dao production code for it to work but i cannot change the production code. can someone suggest me a way to configure a embedded database to test my production dao code through junits...i tried this configuration:..@before.public void setup().{.    db = new embeddeddatabasebuilder().settype(embeddeddatabasetype.hsql).addscript(""create-table.sql"").addscript(""insert-data.sql"").build();.}...but this above code is in my junit. without this above code i am not seeing a way to configure the in-memory database. i cannot have this code in my production environment. how can i configure the in-memory database without making changes to the production code."
