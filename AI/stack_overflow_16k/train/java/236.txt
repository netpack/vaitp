"display error message when user inputs ""0"", cannot get out of ""error"" message any idea on how i can fix this?  i'm telling the user to enter the amount of numbers he would like to average.  of course as you can see in the code, if he inputs a 0 or a negative number i want it to flag the user to enter another number that is not 0 or a negative number.  the problem is, once the user puts a 0 or a negative number, it gets stuck in that state and i have to terminate the program...help?..import blankx.swing.joptionpane;..public class testprogtres .{.    public static void main(string[] args) .    {.         //variable declaration.         string showsome;.         string showsomeagain;.         int z           = 0;.         double avg      = 0;.         double totalamt = 0;..         showsome = joptionpane.showinputdialog(""enter the amount of numbers you would like to average""); .         double allnumbers = double.parsedouble(showsome);..         while (allnumbers &lt; 1).         {.             joptionpane.showinputdialog(""you cannot enter a negative or a 0.  enter the amount of numbers you would like to average"");.             allnumbers = double.parsedouble(showsome);.         }//end while..             if (allnumbers &gt; 0).             {.                 double numbers [] = new double [(int) allnumbers];..                 for (z = 0; z &lt; numbers.length; z++).                 {.                     showsomeagain= joptionpane.showinputdialog(""enter number "" + (z + 1));.                     numbers[z]=double.parsedouble(showsomeagain);..                     totalamt += numbers[z];.                     avg = totalamt/allnumbers;.                 }.             }..              joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, ""the  of the numberes entered is "" + avg);.        }//end main.}// end class"
