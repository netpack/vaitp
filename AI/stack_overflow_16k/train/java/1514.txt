"blank arithmetic: why aren't they ""9 = 9""? i have a question on blank arithmetic with integers and strings. for example,..int a = 1;.int b = 3;.int c = 5;.system.out.println(a + b + (c + "" = "") + a + (b + c));.system.out.println((a + b) + c + "" = "" + a + b + c);.system.out.println(a + (b + c) + "" = "" + (a + b) + c);...the code above outputs ""45 = 18"", ""9 = 135"", and ""9 = 45"" respectively. i don't understand the logic behind this operation. my first instinct was they all output ""9 = 9"". i would like somebody to help me understand this operation. i appreciate your help!"
