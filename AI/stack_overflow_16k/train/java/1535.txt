"how to start on this blank homework about rational numbers? here is my homework:...  create a class called rational for performing arithmetic with fractions. write a program to test your class. use integer variables to represent the private instance variables of the class-the numerator and the denominator..  .  provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it's declared. the constructor should store the fraction in reduced form. the fraction 2/4 is equivalent to 1/2 and would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator. provide a no-argument constructor with default values in case no initializers are provided. provide public methods that perform each of the following operations:.  .  a) add two rational numbers: the result of the addition should be stored in reduced form. implement this as a static method..  .  b) subtracr two rational numbers: the result of the subtraction should be stored in reduced form. implement this as a static method..  .  c) multiply two rational numbers: the result of the multiplication should be stored in reduced form. implement this as a static method ..  .  d) divide two rational numbers: the result of the division should be stored in reduced form. implement this as a static method..  .  e) return a string representation of a rational number in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the denominator..  .  f) return a string representation of a rational number in floating-point format. (consider providing formatting capabilities that enable the user of the class to specify the number of digits of precision to the right of the decimal point.)"
