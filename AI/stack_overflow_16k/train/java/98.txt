"how to create a priority queue with an initial capacity and custom comparator in lambda notation? i am using blank 10 and i am trying to create a simple priority queue. the initial capacity should be 8 (for the sake of the argument) and the priority should be the value in an array prior. i tried to use..private double[] prior;.private priorityqueue&lt;integer&gt; queue;.queue = new priorityqueue&lt;integer&gt;(8, (int v, int w) -&gt; double.compare(prior[v], prior[w]));...in my code, but that does not work. i always get the error ""the constructor priorityqueue((int v, int w) -> {}) is undefined"". what am i doing wrong? the problem seems to be related to the lambda expression, since removing it makes the error disappear."
