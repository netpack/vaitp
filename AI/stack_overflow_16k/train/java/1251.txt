"queue blank implementation issues, why design like this? hi allï¼Œi'm learning queue data structure using blank, but i've seen an abstract class defines an enumeration, enumeration defined here why should there even do good, or do what is so designed thanks..package com.jwetherell.algorithms.data_structures;..import blank.util.arrays;.../**. * queue. a queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in. * which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or. * only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear. * terminal position and removal of entities from the front terminal position.. * this makes the queue a first-in-first-out (fifo) data structure. in a fifo. * data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to. * be removed.. * . * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queue_(abstract_data_type). * . * @author justin wetherell &lt;phishman3579@gmail.com&gt;. */..public abstract class queue&lt;t&gt; {..    public enum queuetype {.        linkedqueue, arrayqueue.    };..    /**.     * enqueue the value in the queue..     * .     * @param value.     *            to enqueue..     */.    public abstract void enqueue(t value);..    /**.     * dequeue the head of the queue..     * .     * @return value that was dequeued..     */.    public abstract t dequeue();..    /**.     * does the queue contain the value. warning this is an o(n) operation..     * .     * @param value.     *            to locate in the queue..     * @return true if queue contains value..     */.    public abstract boolean contains(t value);..    /**.     * number of items in the queue..     * .     * @return number of items..     */.    public abstract int size();..    /**.     * create queue from queuetype..     * .     * @param type.     *            of queue to create..     * @return queue that was created..     */.    public static &lt;t&gt; queue&lt;t&gt; createqueue(queuetype type) {.        switch (type) {.            case arrayqueue:.                return new arrayqueue&lt;t&gt;();.            default:.                return new linkedqueue&lt;t&gt;();.        }.    }...i'm sorry i did not make it clear before the problem, which is the source code"
