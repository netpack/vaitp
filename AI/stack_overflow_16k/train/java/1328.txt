"how to search for a pattern in a sequence of chars? how would you set up a nested loop to search a sequence of chars for every occurrence of a pattern? this is what i have so far, but it's only showing one occurrence and giving an indexoutofbounds error. how can i fix it? ..int i = 0; .while (i &lt; data.size()) { .    if (patternstring.charat(0) == data.get(i)) {.        i++;.        int j = 0; .        while (patternstring.charat(j) == data.get(i)) { .            j++;.            system.out.println(j) ;..            if (j == patternstring.length()) {.                system.out.println(""found pattern "" + ""at index "" + (i));.            }.        } .    } else { i++;} .}"
