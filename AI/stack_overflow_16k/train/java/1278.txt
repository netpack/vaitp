"need to find the size of files using recursion a method that has one file argument. if it is a directory, the method returns the total size (number of bytes) of all files below it. if the argument represents a file, the method just returns the size of that file. the return value should be of type long (which is a kind of integer with a larger range of values than int). to determine the size of a file represented by a file object, use the length() method of the file class (this method doesn't work for directories, just files)...would really appreciate any help! can't seen to figure this out. thanks."
