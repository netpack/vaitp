"good practice or bad practice updating instance variable from inner class say i have a private (inner) class child inside another class parent:..public class parent {.   private boolean isbusy;.   private child child = new child();..   public void dosomething() {.      child.playtoy();.   }..   private class child {..     protected void playtoy() {.          isbusy = true;.     }.   }.}...as you see above, parent class has a boolean instance variable isbusy , the private inner class child has a function playtoy() which updates that boolean. is it a bad practice to update a instance variable defined in upper class from inner class? if it is bad practice, what are the drawbacks?"
