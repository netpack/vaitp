"inputstream/outputstream for standard stream- blank my understanding is, character streams and byte streams work internally over c file * stream.....standard streams in c world are file * stdin, file *stdout &amp; file *stderr....inputstream and outputstream are providing subclasses for resources like file, pipe.......inputstream and outputstream api documentation does not talk about standard streams- stdin/stdout/stderr.....which subclass of inputstream/outputstream dedicated for standard streams?"
