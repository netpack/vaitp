"how can i set multiple class fields using one or several class methods which don't specifically refer to any field? i want to know how or if i can set multiple class fields using one or several class methods which don't specifically refer to any field?. i made the simplest example i could think of. ..my apologies if this is a terribly obvious question which has been answered. i found a couple of questions that seemed similar but they involved several classes and were confusing. i think having this question is beneficial and might be easy for someone to answer...public class myclass {..    private string str = ""hello"";.    private string str2 = ""ciao"";.    private string str3 = ""hola"";..    public void changesomestring(){.        changestring(str);.    }..    private void changestring(string s){.        s = ""goodbye"";.    }..    public void changespecificstring(){.        str = ""goodbye"";.    }..    public void printstring(){.        system.out.println(str);.    }..    public static void main(string args[]) {..        myclass a = new myclass();.        a.printstring();.        a.changesomestring();.        a.printstring();.        a.changespecificstring();.        a.printstring();..    }..}...i can't say i expected, but i wanted..hello.goodbye.goodbye...and i received ..hello.hello.goodbye"
