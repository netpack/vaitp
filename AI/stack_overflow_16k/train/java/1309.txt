"blankl make variable x automatically update to an operation (y+z) i have a program in which i have the variable ""attacktotal"" (or x) to always be ""attack (y) + weapon.getattack() (z)"".  i've come across the problem in which i need to update attacktotal (x) before i use it in case i  changed either attack (y) or weapon.attack (z) beforehand.  is something like this possible?:..int x, y = 5, z = 7;.x (always)= y + z   // x is now 12.y += 2;   // y is now 7, x is now 14"
