"is there a way to inspect class, field and method level annotations in an ""unloaded"" blank class file? i would like to inspect annotations present in a blank class file without requiring any of it's dependedencies to be loaded, only requiring the loading of the basic jvm libraries and the class file in question only...to load a class at runtime in blank requires a classpath having it's field, method, and parameter dependencies findable.  i want to do this in an environment where non of those other files may exist...is this possible? is there an available library to do this?"
