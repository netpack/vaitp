"what is the default method in blank? i don't have any idea about how coding in blank works. because of my work i have to look into some blank code. and one thing confused me. it seems we can have multiple classes for a single project but there is only one main function public static void main() for the project, and when the program runs the compiler first searches for that main function...i have this code:..first.blank..class first {.    public static void main(string args[]) {.        secondclass example = new second();.    }.}...second.blank..class second {.    method1() {}.    method2() {}.}...so, now when the second class runs, which method runs at first ? like in php the index() function runs at the beginning by default...guys, i may have sounded really stupid at places and i'm sorry about it."
