exception in the case of overriding as we know that in the case if method overriding if child class method throws some checked exception then compulsory parent class method should throw same checked exception or its parent class exception otherwise we will get compile error. but there is no rule on un-checked exception...but if assume that blank allows parent class method to have checked exception which is child to the child class method checked exception...can some one please why this is not allowed in the blank.....let put the question in a different way :..you have class a -..class a {..    public void dostuff() throws sqlexception {..    }.}...and class b extends a -..class b extends a {..    public void dostuff() throws exception {..    }.}...it will throw exception during compilation because of violation of the method's contract...assume that the blank would allows this then what would be the consequences ?
