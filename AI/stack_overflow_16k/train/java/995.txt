trying to understand different ways of declaring an object in blank? i am trying to understand what is the difference between the below 2 lines of code...i know for a reason that one is of the reference type list and the other of the reference type arraylist. but does it really matter or is it just 2 different ways of doing the same thing ? ..its not only with these classes/interface but with others as well. i believe it is a polymorphism feature of an object taking different forms is that correct ?..list a1 = new arraylist();.arraylist a1 = new arraylist();
