"utopian tree challenge: variable may not have been initialized i have a problem with one of 30-days-of-code tasks. ...  ""the utopian tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. each spring, it doubles in height. each summer, its height increases by 1 meter..  .  laura plants a utopian tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. how tall will her tree be after growth cycles?""...here's my solution:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    int h;.    scanner scanner = new scanner(system.in);.    int t = scanner.nextint();.    for (int i=0; i&lt;t; i++){.        int n = scanner.nextint();.        if (n == 0){.            h = n * 0 + 1;.        } else if (n % 2 == 0) {.                h = (int)math.pow(2,(n/2)+1)-1;.        } else if (2 % n == 1){..                h = (int)math.pow(2, (n-1)/2+2)-2;.        }.        system.out.println(h);.   }.}...i have error on sout:...  ""variable h may not have been initialized""...when i'm initializing with int h=0 at beginning, then my resault at the sout is always 0."
