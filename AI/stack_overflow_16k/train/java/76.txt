"how should i create a media player only once and call it multiple times? so i'm working on a small mobile game and when i tap on a button it should play a sound effect. i want it to play multiple instances within a small time frame, so soundpool doesn't work in my case..right now, i'm using this method..public void playtapsound(){.        final mediaplayer gamesound = mediaplayer.create(this, r.raw.tapsound);.        gamesound.start();.    }...however, i do not call gamesound.release anywhere as i'm not sure where to call it. so after 40 uses, the sounds stop playing presumably due to too many mediaplayers being created...i tried placing..final mediaplayer gamesound = mediaplayer.create(this, r.raw.tapsound);...into oncreate(), but when i do that, gamesound becomes an error saying ""cannot resolve symbol 'gamesound'""...if i place it before or after oncreate(), the app just crashes as ""this"" is null...when a button is tapped there's some other stuff then i run too..    public void tapped(view view) {.        if (!buttons[0].isallcaps()) {.            playtapsound();.            buttons[0].setbackgroundcolor(color.parsecolor(""#1fab89""));.            buttons[0].setallcaps(true);.            score++;.            x++;.            points.settext(string.valueof(score));.        }.        else {.            buttons[0].setbackgroundcolor(color.parsecolor(""#505bda""));.            lose(score);.        }.    }...hoping i can get some help on where to place a gamesound.release() or how to call gamesound when the player is created on oncreate(). thanks"
