"aligning output so it's nice and neat in blank i've got some output that i would like to make look a little better by aligning everything up like a table. ..probability: 0.7470986802363135   |    approximation: 0.7500081297253628   |    difference: 0.002909449489049254..probability: 0.71639599474715   |    approximation: 0.7198106243620636   |    difference: 0.003414629614913567...it's not really necessary but i'm just curious if there is an elegant way to accomplish this? i was thinking i could round the decimals so that each has the same length but i would prefer not to do that if possible...here's the code for the output:..for (int j = 0; j &lt; 16; j++){.    double diff = approxresults[j] - probresults[j];.    system.out.println(""probability: "" + probresults[j] + ""   |    approximation: "" + approxresults[j] + ""   |    difference: "" + diff);.}"
