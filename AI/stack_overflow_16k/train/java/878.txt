"nested loops reversing counter position hey guys i've just learnt how to do nested loops. heres what i've done...public class test_1 {..public static void main(string[] args) {.    final int max = 10;..    for (int row = 1; row &lt;= max; row++) {.        for (int col = 1; col &lt;= row; col++).            system.out.print(col);..        system.out.println();.    }..}...}..i printed the 'col' to get each row to count up to the 10 which i thought was pretty sweet!..1.12.123.1234.12345.123456.1234567.12345678.123456789.12345678910...i have one question though, how would i go about reversing the numbers? what i mean is counting the column from the right...1.21.321.4321.54321.654321.7654321.87654321.987654321.10987654321"
