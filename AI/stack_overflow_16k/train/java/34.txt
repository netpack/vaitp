"blank programmming- help initialize(carpet) i have started how to learn blank programming and i a got a problem while doing an asignment:.ps this is a c programming assignment, using it to do a blank programming:...  consider a (potentially large commercial) room that has floor dimensions length len and width wid. the area of the floor is given by multiplying len by wid..  .  carpet tiles are provided as individual squares (2 feet by 2 feet). write, compile and run a c program, carpet.c, that.  .  -calculates the minimum number of carpet tiles that are needed to cover a room whose dimensions (len and wid) are input from the terminal (measurements are in inches). nb: floor tiles can be cut to fit at the edges of the room - try to minimise waste..  .  -calculates how many carpet-tile packs are needed. the supplier only provides carpet tiles in packs of ten (i.e. individual tiles cannot be purchased separately)..  .  -calculates how many spare tiles are left over once the minimum number of packs have been purchased..  .  -prints out all these results in a neat table along with the total cost of the order. (a pack of tiles costs $50 for each of the first four packs, and the price reduces to $45 for each subsequent pack.) .  .  think carefully about how are you going to test your program? the calculations are non-trivial and easy to get wrong. if your program doesn't work then you will waste the company a lot of money and you will probably lose the contract to supply the software..  .  you should write out a number of test cases (by hand) that cover all the different possibilities that could happen. don't forget to consider various boundary cases too - these are often where errors are detected....so far i have done:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class carpet {.    public static void main (string args[]){.    scanner scanf = new scanner (system.in);..        float len, wid;.        float area;..        int roundtiles;.        int roundpacks;..        float tarea;.        float tpack;.        float nooftiles;.        float noofpacks;.        float tspares1;.        float tspares2;.        int packcost;.        int cost;..        tarea= 12* 12;.        tpack= 10;..        system.out.format(""enter the length of the room, inches: "");.        len = scanf.nextfloat();..        system.out.format(""enter the width of the room, inches: "");.        wid = scanf.nextfloat();..        area = len * wid;..        nooftiles = area/ tarea;.        noofpacks = nooftiles/tpack;...        roundtiles = (int) math.ceil(nooftiles);.        roundpacks = (int) math.ceil(noofpacks);....        tspares1 = roundpacks * 10;.        tspares2 = tspares1 - roundtiles;..        if (roundpacks &lt;= 4).            packcost =50;.        else if(roundpacks &gt; 4).        {.            packcost = 45;.            packcost = packcost + 20;   *&lt;&lt;-----******line 50-----*********..        }...        cost =roundpacks * packcost; *&lt;&lt;*******---error-------------*********..        system.out.println(cost);..        }..}...the error says: ""the local variable packcost may not have been initialized""..and the compiler says: ""exception in thread ""main"" blank.lang.error: unresolved compilation problem: .    the local variable packcost may not have been initialized.    at carpet.main(carpet.blank:50)."""
