"how do i create a grid map on a png image with blank? the thing is that i'm helping a friend with a blank project for the universty, and we have to create a remake of msx's knightmare. the game is pretty developed already but we don't know how to create the collision with the scenary's stuff, like the columns and the bridge over the river. in order to do this i thought that we could just create a logical ""grid-mapping"" over the png (the whole level is this image, invoked on the game like a plain image) and do the logic on it, just a boolean logic. ..so the basic way, that i suggest to do, is a 2d array with this grid calculated on our minds. is there some tool that we could use in order to do this easier or automated somehow?..knightmare original version video..and this is the image that we are using on the game"
