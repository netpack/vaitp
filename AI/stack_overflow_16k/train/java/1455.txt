"the number of iterations of >>>> ""for(int i=start;i<num;i++)"" i i'm talking about for loops in that form  for(int i=0;i&lt;5;i++)..i was  expecting that the increment statement is done after the check and i think i wrote  programs depending on that concept ...the problem is that when i tried to run that code..`for( int i = 0; i&lt;5; i++) {.  system.out.println(i);.}       ...i was surprised to find the doesn't include 5.the output was .0.1.2.3.4..i'm confused with this i think the statments must be executed at its order"
