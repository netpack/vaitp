"throwing exceptions from within completablefuture exceptionally clause i am having a problem dealing with exceptions throw from completablefuture methods. i thought it should be possible to throw an exception from within the exceptionally clause of a completablefuture. for example, in the method below, i expected that executework would throw a runtimeexception because i am throwing one in the various exceptionally clauses, however, this does not work and i'm not sure why...public void executework() {..  service.getallwork().thenaccept(worklist -&gt; {.    for (string work: worklist) {.      service.getworkdetails(work).        .thenaccept(a -&gt; sendmessagetoqueue(work, a)).        .exceptionally(t -&gt; {.          throw new runtimeexception(""error occurred looking up work details"");.        });.  }.  }).exceptionally(t -&gt; {.    throw new runtimeexception(""error occurred retrieving work list"");.  });.}"
