"confusion decoding using format and printf i am very new to string formatting using format() and printf methods. i have read the tutorial on oracle site but finding it very confusing. so decided to try some examples. i got this sample  and.have understood the output as 124.00 ..public class teststringformatter {.  public static void main(string[] args){.    /* i do understand % - denotes start of instruction.       , is the flag.       6 - denotes width.       2 - denotes precision.       f - type */  .    string s = string.format(""%,6.2f"",124.000) ;.    system.out.printf(s);.  }.}...what i am not able to understand is , is the flag and how it is used in this formatting?.can someone explain the use of flag "","" in this example."
