"blank concept inheritance hack? this is a mistake?..the problem : i have 4 classes v, a, b, c, d...the class e need to extend v, a, b, d, but how? ..class a extends v{}.class b extends a{} // this class extends a and v.class d extends b{} // this class extends a , v and b..class e extends d{} // multiples...this is possible, but is it correct? i know that blank has no multiple inheritance."
