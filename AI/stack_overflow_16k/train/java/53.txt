"method parameters blank public double computepayment(double loanamt,                   .                 double rate,.                 double futurevalue,.                 int numperiods) {.   double interest = rate / 100.0;.   double partial1 = math.pow((1 + interest), .                - numperiods);.   double denominator = (1 - partial1) / interest;.   double answer = (-loanamt / denominator).                - ((futurevalue * partial1) / denominator);.   return answer;.}...i am a beginner at blank and had a question about parameters. what exactly are they? i thought they were the variables used in the method, but now i see other variables like interest and partial1 being used in the method. these variables are derived from the parameter variables but still, what are parameters? ..thanks in advance."
