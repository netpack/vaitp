"why so huge difference between data quantity if a number of bits and bytes just doubled? byte has 8 bits value what is = 1 byte and it is can hold values from - 128 to 127 and short has 16 bits of what is = 2 bytes can hold - 32768 to 32767. ..why so huge difference between data quantity if a number of bits and bytes just doubled? we need to have - 254 to 253 not 32 thousand with something. why do we have a number in 258 times more, not just twice? ..why do we have the so huge difference between data memory reservation in particular data types? i mean, why bits doubled but data actually growing like geometrically not doubled? is that just because it is useful? or something?  ..thanks"
