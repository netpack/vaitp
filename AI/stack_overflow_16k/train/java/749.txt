"same method for client and server slightly different behavior most of my classes have different behavior if they are client or server side. (client: gui, server: connection stuff) but they also have some common behavior. i want to know what's the best way to do this...example content of a class:..public class example{.    private void commonmethod(){.        //common code.    }..    public void clientmethod(){.        commonmethod().        //client code.    }..    public void servermethod(){.        commonmethod().        //server code.    }..}...what i want:...1 method with some way to specify client or server.readable code...what is allowed:...still have 3 private methods : server, common and client...what i want to avoid:...case (unless it is readable / short).if...things i was thinking of:...enums (to specify client and server) and a case (better then to use meaningless ints or booleans).annotations (@clientside) (@serverside)...edit:..my classes are loaded in by an api, an example client/server method would be init. so in my main class i need to run that method for all the classes that need initialization."
