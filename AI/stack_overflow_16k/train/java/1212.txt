"having trouble creating hands for multiple players i've got my program to the point where it asks the user to input the number of cards as well as the number of players. i'm just looking to print out each of the players cards. ex. (player 1: ace of spades, two of hearts. player 2: two of clubs, etc..) i have got it to print out, but it seems to only print out one set of cards despite there being 2 inputted into the number of players. here's my code...hand class:....public class hand .{. private int handsize;   //how many cards in the hand. private int cardsinhand;  //counter. private card [] hand;. . . public hand (). {.  hand = new card[52];.  handsize = 5;.  cardsinhand = 0;. }. . public hand (int handsize). {.  hand = new card [handsize];.  this.handsize = handsize;.  . }.. public void addcard (card card). {.  if (cardsinhand &gt;= handsize) .  {.   card[] temp = new card[hand.length*2];.   for (int i=0; i &lt; cardsinhand; i++).   { .    temp[i] = hand[i];.    hand = temp;.   }.  }.  . }....deck class:...public class deck .{. . private card [] deck;. private int nextcard;. . . public deck(). {.  deck = new card[52];.        int icardcount=0;  // holds how many cards have been created..        for ( int suit = 0; suit &lt;= 3; suit++ ) .        {.            for ( int face = 1; face &lt;= 13; face++ ) .            {.                deck[icardcount] = new card(icardcount);.                icardcount++;.            }.        }.        nextcard = 0;. }. .    public card dealacard (). {.  if (nextcard &lt; 52).  {.   system.out.println( deck[nextcard++]);.  }.  else.  {.   system.out.print(""nerror, out of cards."" ); .  }.  return (null);. }.   . public hand dealahand (int n). { .  hand hand = new hand(n);.  card deal = new card(n);.  . .  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) .  { .   hand = dealacard();.  }.  return hand;. }.....my driver: ....system.out.println (""how many cards in the hand? "");.int ihand = kb.nextint();.hand newhand = new hand(ihand);.system.out.println(""how many players are playing? "");.int iplayers = kb.nextint();.deck seconddeck = new deck();.seconddeck.shuffle();.seconddeck.dealahand(ihand);.....what i get as an output:....how many cards in the hand? .5.how many players are playing? .2.the two of spades.the ace of hearts.the ten of diamonds.the queen of clubs.the nine of hearts.....i'd like for it to print out two sets of cards as opposed to just one, but i logically can't figure out how to do it. any help would be great, thanks."
