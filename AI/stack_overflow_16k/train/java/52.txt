"accessing addresses in blank through tcp connection i'm attempting read/write to a 64k byte buffer on a server my boss created. while being able to connect to the server through a standard tcp connection, i am rather lost as to how to access the byte buffer itself. most examples i've employ the use of fileinputstreams, but i am not reading from any file in particular. what i've been told is that the server:..""...creates a 64kbyte buffer that starts out all zeros. you can do vme read/write tcp commands and only the lower 16bits of the address you specify will be used to address this 64kbyte buffer.""..so what i am trying to figure out is how do i access this byte buffer to read and write to the addresses on the server...forgive me if this is too general, i am very new to both networking and stackoverflow. thanks :)"
