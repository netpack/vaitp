"blank - know the obj which have my current object in attr i'm sure the answer is easier than i think, and i'm a little exhausted so sorry if you find my question .. dumb...let us consider the two following classes :..public class objet1 {.     private objet2 obj;.     //getter &amp; setter.}..public class objet2 {.    public void myfunc(objet1 objj) {.    // blabla.    }.}...in myfunc i need to have access to some methods of object1, that's why i have object1 in params..is there any other solution to access it ? .cause i have to write something like object1 ob = new object1(); ob.getobject2().myfunc(ob);.and i don't think/know if it is a good use of blank....i'm in the object2 class' and i want to know if it is possible to have access to the object1 which have my actual object2 in attr without passing him throught another param..thanks in advance, and sorry if i didn't use the goods terms, it is certainly why i didn't find an answer"
