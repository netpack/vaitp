"console output alignment hi i'm trying to align output to the console window in blank using netbeans...atm i have a collection of mp3tracks (classes) in an arraylist. the user is able to sort the track by artist, album &amp; track name etc after the sort the reordered list is via the console:..system.out.println(vector);..my mp3track class overrides tostring():..@override.public string tostring(){.    return(string.format(""track no: %-8s track title: %-25s artist name: %-15s album name: %-20s track length: %-10s"", trackno , tracktitle, artistname, albumname, tracklength + ""n""));...}..this solution works for all but the first line which is line and the first and last digit output is []. i would like all lines to line up and to remove both [] at the beginning and end. i'm a first year software engineering student and this in my first assignment in blank so please excuse my inexperience! ..i would very much appreciate some suggestion here...many thanks in advance.."
