"integer to string issue in my blank program i receive a string from my arduino by the serial port..the string is stored in variable (string) : result...an example of what the data could be: 'w: 125' (always 1 character, a colon, and a space, with a analog value from my arduino)..in my code i do:..int spacepos = result.indexof("" ""); // search where the space is.number= result.substring(spacepos+1); // take everything what comes behind the space.system.out.println(number); // print the value, example : 125.int number2 = integer.parseint(number);// this should convert the string 125 to a integer with value 125.system.out.println(number2);// should print a integer with value 125...the part with substring works; i think. when i print the number i can see the 125 in the output screen of netbeans, but i can select a few spaces??? behind my number..but when i print number2, i don't see anything...any assistance you may provide is appreciated.  thanks."
