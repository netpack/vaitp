"how to generate 4 digit random numbers in blank from 0000 to 9999 i tried the following..int number = threadlocalrandom.current().nextint(1000, 9999 + 1);...but it won't generate 4 digit numbers like 0004,0035 and so on.....i searched for similar questions but none solved, they were different from what i need, if there's already an existing question please let me know...i need no genarate numbers like 1485 and 0180, not only numbers starting with 0."
