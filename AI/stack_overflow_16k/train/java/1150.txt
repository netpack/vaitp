"program running, but not displaying anything? i'm just getting back into blank programming and long story short, i made an applet without knowing those can only run in browsers so i tried to change to code so i could put it in a runnable .jar, but when i run my code it doesn't do anything...public static void main(string args[]).{.    setbackground(color.black); //sets the background to black..    font myfont = new font(""arial"", font.plain, 14); //makes ""myfont"" a font that is plain..    setfont(myfont); //sets the font to ""myfont""...}..private static void setfont(font myfont) {...}..private static void setbackground(color black) {..}..public void paint(blank.awt.graphics g) {.    g.setcolor(color.blue); //sets anything in ""paint"" to be in blue..    int xarray[] = {20, 110, 200, 200, 110, 20, 20}; //this line, and the line below are the cords for the bowtie..    int yarray[] = {20, 45, 20, 100, 65, 100, 20};.    g.drawpolygon(xarray, yarray, 7); //draws the bowtie..    g.drawstring(""bow ties are no longer cool."", 20, 150); //writes the text....}.}"
