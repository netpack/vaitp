"incompatible types string and char i'm not sure why i'm getting this error. i think the code in general is okay although i'm sure there is a shorter way then using all the else ifs. the problem is it says incompatible types and i really am just lost on how to fix this. any help would be appreciated. ..import blank.util.scanner;.public class missionimpossible.{.    public static void main(string [] args){.        string lineone,  r2d2 = """";..       scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.       system.out.println(""please enter a word so i can see how many vowels it has."");..       int count = 0;..       lineone = in.nextline();..       int word = lineone.length();..       for (int i = word -1; i&gt;= 0; i--) .        {.            r2d2= lineone.charat(i);..            if (r2d2== 'a'|| r2d2=='a').            count++;.            else if (r2d2=='e'||r2d2=='e').            count++;.            else if (r2d2=='o'|| r2d2=='o').            count++;.            else if (r2d2=='u'||r2d2=='u').            count++;.            else if (r2d2=='y'||r2d2=='y').            count++;..    }.    system.out.println(count);.          }.           }"
