"blankfx - concurrentmodificationexception having read other questions on here i believe i would be right in saying that this error occurs when you are trying to modify the children of a node while iterating over it...i saw a couple of methods i could use to overcome this issue, however when i was messing around with my code i noticed that by replacing my enhanced for loop with a regular for loop it solved the issue...my first question is why does this work? it would seem to me that i am still modifying the children of a node while iterating over them, so i don't understand why this now works..secondly, is there anything wrong with overcoming the error in this way?..update..as requested, here is a snippet of code..    arraylist&lt;button&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;button&gt;();.    button b1 = new button();.    button b2 = new button();.    button b3 = new button();.    collections.addall(list, b1, b2, b3);..    //error.    for(button b : list) {.        list.remove(b);.    }..    //no error.    for(int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {.        button b = list.get(i);.        list.remove(b);.    }"
