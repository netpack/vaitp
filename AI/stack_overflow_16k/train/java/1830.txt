"changing return type of method gives blank.lang.nosuchmethoderror i changed the return type of one method in an interface in a library..previously it was void and i modified it to return an object. i did not change the code in my module as i did not want to do anything with the returned object(it was for a different module).i compiled my module with the new library jar and ran unit tests which ran fine but when i pushed the jar along with the library jar to production and ran the module, i get blank.lang.nosuchmethoderror for the method i changed on the interface..i modified the interface as well as the implementation, both are in the library jar and i use spring annotations to inject the implementation object in my module..what is the possible cause of this problem?"
