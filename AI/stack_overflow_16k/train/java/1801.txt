"how can i pick a string apart and outprint it? public void display().{..    super.display();..    string str =  super.getchoices();..    system.out.println(str);..    while(!str.equals("""")) .    { .        int a = str.indexof("" "");.        system.out.println(str.substring(0, a));.        string sentence = str.replacefirst(str, str.substring(a));.        system.out.println(sentence);.    }.} ...i have a string str containing ""apple banana orange"". i want to system out print these fruits separately because they are each a choice to a question stored in a single variable. how can i do this? the code above is my failed attempt because the substring doesn't update the str variable rather creates a new string. i can't use a loop and i can't make it dynamic and thus not use it."
