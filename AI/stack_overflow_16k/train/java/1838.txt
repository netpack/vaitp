"how do i change a variable in one blank class from another, then access that changed variable from a third blank class? so say i have 3 blank classes, a, b, and c. class a has an int variable named num that equals 3. i want to be able to change num from class b to another number (for example, 45), then access that variable from class c so that it equals 45. how would i do this?..//first class.public class a.{.    public int num;..    public a() {.        num = 3;.    }..    public void setnum(int newnum) {.        num = newnum;.    }..    public int getnum() {.        return num;.    }.}..//second class.public class b.{.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        a a = new a();.        c c = new c();..        system.out.println(a.getnum());..        a.setnum(45);..        system.out.println(a.getnum());..        c.printstuff();.    }.}..//third class.public class c.{.    public void printstuff() {.        a a = new a();..        system.out.println(a.getnum());.    }.}...the first two print statements output the expected 3 and 45, but the print statement in the c class still outputs a 3, even though i changed num's value to 45 in class b."
