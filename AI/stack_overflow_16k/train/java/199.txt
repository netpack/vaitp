"re-writing autoit code in a more blank friendly scripting language i've got autoit code/program which is required to run in the background and i've been trying to integrate with blank with little success as seen in my earlier post here. ..essentially i would like to re-write this in another scripting language that is more friendly with blank...which other ""easy-to-understand"" autoit alternatives that are preferably easy to integrate with blank exist?..thanks."
