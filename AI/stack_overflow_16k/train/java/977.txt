"blank object reference in another object we have the class like this:..public static class song {.    private string name;.    private song nextsong;..    public song(string name) {.        this.name = name;.    }..    public void setnextsong(song nextsong) {.        this.nextsong = nextsong;.    }..    public boolean isrepeatingplaylist() {.        //smth .    }.}...and call it this way:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    song first = new song(""hello"");.    song second = new song(""eye of the tiger"");..    first.setnextsong(second);.    second.setnextsong(first);..    system.out.println(first.isrepeatingplaylist());.}...a playlist is considered a repeating playlist if any of the songs contain a reference to a previous song in the playlist. otherwise, the playlist will end with the last song which points to null...how to implement correctly a function isrepeatingplaylist() that returns true if a playlist is repeating or false if it is not?..by the way, the output should be true as both songs point to each other?..as i see the should check if the song object is referenced from another song object but have no idea how to. please, advice!"
