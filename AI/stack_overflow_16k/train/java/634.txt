"blank child knows parent but parent doesn't know their childs i have a list of objects in blank. for example, this json-like pseudo code:..[.  {.    username: ""u1"",.    password: ""p1"",.    email: ""e1"",.    parent: null.  },.  {.    username: ""u2"",.    password: ""p2"",.    email: ""e2"",.    parent: (the first object for example).  },.  {.    username: ""u3"",.    password: ""p3"",.    email: ""e3"",.    parent: (also the first object for example).  }.]...i want a function that organize all the objects in an array like this:..[.  {.    {.      username: ""u1"",.      password: ""p1"",.      email: ""e1"",.      parent: null.    },.    [.      {.        username: ""u2"",.        password: ""p2"",.        email: ""e2"",.        parent: (as the parent of u2 is u1 it will be nested inside him).      },.      {.        username: ""u3"",.        password: ""p3"",.        email: ""e3"",.        parent: (also as the parent of u3 is u1 it will be nested inside him).      }.    ].  }.]...basically i want a function that search for all child objects and nest them inside his correspondent parent...i tried to search in google but i couldn't express myself to him to find what i want. can someone please give some hint or help on how to do it?..ps: in this example to be easier to understand i wrote the objects in json but they are in blank. the object knows his parent by the field ""parent"" that points to the other object"
