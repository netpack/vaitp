"calling format on string instance i have been taking a look at blank 8 after spending a long time with scala. being stuck in scala mode as i was hacking around i wrote something like ""# instance_method:%s thread:%d"".format(teststr, testnum);"" . weirdly compiler doesn't complain, even though i cannot find an instance method named ""format"" in string documentation (turns out i didn't realize the docs for static method were what's relevant here). so the following code:..public class weird{.    public static void main(string[] args){.        string teststr = ""hmm"";.        long testnum = 7l;.        string weird = ""# instance_method:%s thread:%d"".format(teststr, testnum);.        string msg = string.format(""# static:%s thread:%d"", teststr, testnum);.        system.err.println(weird);.        system.err.println(msg);.    }.}   ...gave output:..hmm.# static:hmm thread:7...so ""# instance_method:%s thread:%d"".format(teststr, testnum); evaluates to teststr . i probably doing something dumb, but what's going on here?"
