"autoloading blank static blocks as for jdbc4 it is required that the jdbc driver loads automatically. it is made by adding a static block where the driver registers in drivermanager. however when i'm writing such a block in my class, it is executed only when i create the object of this class. otherwise the code is not run...my question is: how do the drivers initilize itself, when they are not being created from the application code, however they are registered in drivermanager when i use it for getting db connection?"
