"how to import .dat file into multiple arrays alright so i'm working on a program that reads a periodic table and you can search elements based on number or abbreviation...anyway, i'm a bit stuck trying to read the periodic table file into 4 different arrays: atomic number, abbreviation, element name, and atomic weight...i dunno how to write a single method to import all that info into each array in one go.  i want to have a class that holds all these arrays and that i can call to later when i need each one...here is what i got so far, i'm a bit rusty by the way... i thought working on this program would refamiliarize me with the basics...class periodictable{.    private string filename = ""periodictable.dat"";..    private int[]    atomicnumtable    = new int[200];.    private string[] abbreviationtable = new string[200];.    private string[] nametable         = new string[200];.    private double[] atomicweighttable = new double[200];..    periodictable(string filename){.        readtable(filename);.    }..    public int[] readtable(string filename){.        scanner infile = null;.        try{.            infile = new scanner(new file(filename));.        }catch(filenotfoundexception nf){.            system.out.println(filename + "" not found"");.            system.exit(0);.        }..        atomicnumtable = new int[200];.        int i = 0;.        while(infile.hasnext() &amp;&amp; i &lt; atomicnumtable.length){.            int number = infile.nextint();.            atomicnumtable[i] = number;.            i++;.        }.        infile.close();.        return atomicnumtable;.    }.}...here is what each line of the table looks like:..1    h   hydrogen    1.00794"
