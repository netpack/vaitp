"convert unsigned 64-bit decimal to blank double i'm being sent an unsigned 64-bit decimal value and am required to store it as a double, which of course is signed...realizing i will lose a little bit of precision with values that make use of the most significant bit, what is the best way to accomplish this?..perhaps there is a way to manipulate the unsigned value using double.doubletolongbits() or the bigdecimal class?..thanks in advance!"
