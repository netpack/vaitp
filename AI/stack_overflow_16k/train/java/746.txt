"url auto-detection and highlighting in a block of text the user may enter text for example..this is some text, visit www.mysite.com. thanks &amp; bye....the url should be found and turned into a link, for display in a website. all other characters should appear as-is...i have been searching and googling for some time. i'm sure this sort of thing must already exist. my temptation is to program this myself but i'm sure this is more complex than it looks....dots can be part of a url, or can be a sentence terminator as above. i think users have the expectation that this will be handled properly; outlook handles this correctly, for example..there are various different protocols such as http:, https: etc., plus links are often entered without a protocol specifier, as above..it is necessary to produce html (so that the &lt;a ...&gt; tag can be inserted) therefore it would be necessary to replace e.g. &amp; with &amp;amp; before doing that; however some urls have &amp; in them (e.g. xyz.cgi?a=b&amp;c=d) and there we only want an &amp;amp; to be inserted in the displayable part of the url not in the link itself (&lt;a href=""...&amp;..."">...&amp;amp;...&lt;/a&gt;)...i'm sure there are other issues that i will encounter as soon as i attempt to program this myself. i don't think that a simple reg-exp is the way forward...is there any library which already does this, ideally for blank? (if it's in another technology maybe i can take a look at it and convert it to blank)"
