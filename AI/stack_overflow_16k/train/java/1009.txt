"how do we take command line arguments using arg[] from intellij/eclipse i was asked to run a program using command line arguments. the command line argument could either be a file or stdin. .eg:..your program must accept input from two sources: a filename passed in.command line arguments and stdin. for example './program input.txt' and './program &lt; input.txt' should work...let me be frank, i am not sure whether i am being asked to pass the location of the file or feed the input to the program using stdin. i am assuming, for now, it's asking me to input the location of the file. how can i do it using arg[0]? can i use system.in, will that violate the requirement that is being asked from me?"
