"better way to catch trouble points user submits a csv file which is consumed by a program. values which are used throughout the program come from the csv, natually if values are missed it is a problem. below is my solution...ip on top..private list&lt;string&gt; currentfieldname = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();...as part of the method:..try {.  setcurrentfieldname(""trim space"");.  p.settrimspace(currentlinearray[dc.gettrim_position()].equals(""yes"") ? true : false);..  setcurrentfieldname(""ignore case"");.  p.setignorecase(currentlinearray[dc.getignore_case_position()].equals(""yes"") ? true : false);..} catch (nullpointerexception e) {.    throw new inputspreadsheetvalueunassignedexception(""""type"" field not set: "" + currentfieldname);.}...and the method which keeps track of a current field being looked at:..private void setcurrentfieldname(string fieldname) {. currentfieldname.clear();. currentfieldname.add(fieldname);.}...the idea there is that if user fails to submit value and i will end up getting null, before throwing an exception, i will know what value was not assigned...so, this being said, specific questions:...is what i have shown below an acceptable solution?.can you suggest something more elegant?"
