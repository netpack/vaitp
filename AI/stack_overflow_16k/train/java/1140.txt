"code to print first 6 mersenne prime number code? i am asked to write a method that would display the first six mersenne prime numbers. i definitely know there is something so wrong but i just can't figure it out. i have this code which does not display anything:..public static void printmersenneprimes().{.    int p = 1;.    int counter = 0;.    int powtwo = 2;.    boolean isprime = true;..    while(counter &lt;= 6) .    {.        //determine p is a prime number or not.        for (int m = 2; isprime; m++) {.            if (m * m &gt; p) {.                isprime = true;.                break;.            }.            if (p % m == 0) {.                isprime = false;.            }.        }.        //if p is a prime number, test if it equals 2^n-1.        if (isprime) {.            while(powtwo &lt;= p + 1) {.                powtwo *= 2;.                if(powtwo == p + 1) {.                    system.out.println(p);.                    counter++;.                }.            }.        }.        p++;.        powtwo = 2;.    }.}...if someone can help me and explain what my problem is, i'll really appreciate that...."
