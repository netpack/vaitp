"not sure why programme returns an int ok so basic question here. ..double test = 1/3 * 3.14;...i realize that you need to do (1.0/3) in order to get the actual double number. but what i am wondering is why. i would have thought that since you are multiplying by 3.14 this would make it a double. ..so am i correct in thinking that whenever two values are used in an arithmetic equation, regardless of what is happening around them, if they are integers then you will get an integer value?..ie. x/y * z..while x is divided by y that is all that the programme cares about and if they are both integers you will get an integer value back? it is only when you multiply it by z (3.14) that it becomes a double."
