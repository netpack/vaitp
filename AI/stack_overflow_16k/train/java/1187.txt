read input from windows cmd how can i get an input from another blank program? i have one class that generates a random graph and writes it in the windows cmd console with system.out.println();. what i want is this other class to read this output and use it to do some calculations. both classes are working fine - all i need to know is how to get this output from the first class...edit:.i want this http://pastebin.com/gnsuzvht to read the output that this http://pastebin.com/cgxmcbgb do to put it back in a matrix.
