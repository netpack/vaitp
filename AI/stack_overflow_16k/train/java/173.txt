"adding numbers from a string that are separated by a space i'm writing a program for class and what it does is it asks the user how many students are in a class and how many exams they took. then, using a for loop, it asks for the name and exam scores of each individual student based on what you entered before, once you have entered that it gives you their average test score and a few other things. the problem i'm having is that i can't figure out how you take the average of the test scores. i can't get my program to read the test scores put in by the user and then take the average. thanks for any help in advance...import blank.util.scanner;..public class gradecalculator {.    public static void main(string[] args){.        //define variables.        int students;.        int exams;.        int sum = 0;.        int examaverage = 0;.        string examscores;.        string studentname;....        //create scanner.        scanner s = new scanner(system.in);..        //print the first block.        system.out.println(""welcome to gradecalculator!"");.        system.out.println("""");.        system.out.println(""please enter the number of students: "");.        students = s.nextint();.        system.out.println(""please enter the number of exams: "");.        exams = s.nextint();.        s.nextline();.        system.out.println(""- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"");..        //for loop.        for (int i = 1; i&lt;=students; i++){.            system.out.println(""enter student "" + i + ""'s name: "");.            studentname = s.nextline();.            system.out.println(""enter exam scores: "" );.            examscores = s.nextline();.            sum+=integer.parseint(examscores);.            examaverage = sum/exams;.            system.out.println(""grade statistics for "" + studentname);.            system.out.println(""t average: "" + examaverage);.            system.out.println(""t letter grade: "");.            system.out.println(""t""+ studentname + "" gets a "");.            system.out.println(""- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"");.        }..        //print the last block.        system.out.println(""class statistics:"");.        system.out.println(""t average: "");.        system.out.println(""t lowest: "");.        system.out.println(""t highest: "");.        system.out.println("""");.        system.out.println(""done, good bye!"");...    }..}"
