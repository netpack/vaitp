"how does the multicast worked in below code? the following program prints unexpected output, can anyone please tell me how the multicast worked here. i searched a lot and got this typecast rule ""sign extension is performed if the type of the original value is signed; zero extension if it is a char, regardless of the type to which it is being.converted."" still unable to figure out the what happened while casting...    public class multicast .    {.       public static void main(string[] args) .       {.          system.out.println((int) (char) (byte) -1);.       }.    }...output: 65535"
