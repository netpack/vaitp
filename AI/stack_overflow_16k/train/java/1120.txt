"what is openjdk ""fastdebug"" build mode? how is it different from ""release""? what are the differences between openjdk ""fastdebug"" and ""release"" builds? could an application run significantly slower on ""fastdebug"" than on ""release""?..i've heard that ""fastdebug"" is somehow ""good"", and could find a lot of messages on the internet from people looking for ""fastdebug"" builds of various openjdk versions and for various platforms, or explaining how to prepare those builds manually, but having trouble finding anywhere a clear description of what does ""fastdebug"" essentially mean."
