"blank memory management and when to destroy object i have written a small blank program where i create 10 string objects...can someone explain or answer the following questions....what are the best practices to create a object. ie; when i create a object should i also make sure i delete the object once its used. if, how do i delete it? .if i don't delete the object, is that the object will be lying until the program ends?.is there a way to check the number of active objects when a program is running?.....public class test{..    static public void main(string[] args){.        for (integer i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++){.            string s1 = new string(""creating new string"");.        }.        system.out.println(""program completed"");.    }..}"
