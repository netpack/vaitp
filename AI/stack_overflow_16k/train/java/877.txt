"accessing data from another class blank okay, this is total noob stuff, and this is a simple concept i just cannot grasp from everything i've looked at...currently i have some a gui with a jlist, when you select the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or whatever thing in the list it gets the respective value from a list. however, i want to move this list to a 'data' class (or all my values are elsewhere, for easier maintainence - and yes i want them hard coded into the software)...new defaultcomboboxmodel(.                        new string[] { ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e"" });.                        final double[] lettercost = { 2.5, 1, 1, 1, 2.5 };...so when someone clicks e, for example, in the jlist lettercost is set to 2.5 .i want to move this bit..final double[] lettercost = { 2.5, 1, 1, 1, 2.5 };...into another class. i'm over simplifying what i'm actually doing. i just want to get my head around the concept. i've never worked with multiple classes before. ..so how would i go about making a new class, having the data in that class, and have it accessed as it currently would be from my original class?..thanks.. ..oh, and if i had something that changed the values (say every time someone picked a letter the value increased by 1), would that continue to work the same?"
