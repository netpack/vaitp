how to read only first expression of my file and move to another line i have a file that looks like follows:....what i need is to read only names (first column) and output it...  while (sc.hasnext()) .     system.out.println(sc.next()); ...another solution i tried is:..  while (sc.hasnextline()) .     system.out.println(sc.nextline()); ...the ones that are above obviously don't work. i am stuck and don't know what to do. i was trying to google my problem but couldn't find the answer.
