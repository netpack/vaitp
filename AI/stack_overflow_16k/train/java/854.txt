"concatenation in blank? in php you can concatenate strings with .= so that the string grows with what ever you add to it. i wonder if this could be done in blank? i made some test in this code, to add all number into one long string, but not working! could it be done in some other way?..int number = 100;.for (int x = number; x &lt;= 2; x--) {..    resultat = resultat + integer.tostring(x);.}"
