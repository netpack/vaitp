"how do i count an occurence of a specific word in a txt file in blank? i'm trying to just create a basic word counter for a specific word inside the ""list.txt"" document. the code i'm using right now is not scanning ""customer"" even though customer appears a few times in the word document already, i've tried making a string variable with the value of ""customer"" instead but that also didn't work, could anyone perhaps correct where i've gone wrong? ..static int totalcontracts() throws filenotfoundexception .{.    scanner scannerinput = new scanner(""list.txt"");.    int count = 0;.    while (scannerinput.hasnext()) .    { .        string nextword = scannerinput.next();.        system.out.println(nextword);.        if (nextword.equals(""customer"")) .        {.            count++;.        }.    }.    return count;.}"
