"design approach for loading data from different sources (oracle, flat files) using blank i am looking around for a design approach on loading data from different sources (oracle, flat files etc) and loading them in the target relational model using blank. i already have the target data model in place, currently it has four entities a,b,c,d - where d has references of a,b,c ids, so i need to populate the first three tables. .for entity a:.i need to read a record from source and compare it with already existing in entity a (in first load it will be empty so i would directly insert it), compare on all the columns of that record, if there is difference then i would update the target else i move to other record..i am considering spring batch, but for comparing each and every record i will have lot of db calls which would impact the performance..i would appreciate help on designing strategies. i don't want to consider etl tools like informatica, abinitio etc...target database would always remain as oracle."
