returning instance of abstract method i have an abstract class with a method that i would like to return 'this' of the classes' subclasses. when i'm using the method i don't want it to return the object casted as myclass and me have to recast it back to what it really is. is there a pretty way of doing this with a generic?..abstract public class myclass{..    public &lt;asubclassofmyclass&gt; dosomething(){..        return this;.    }.}
