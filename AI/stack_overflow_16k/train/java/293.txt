how i can print stacktrace from my blank class to a servlet i want to print the stack trace on my jsp page. i am calling a method from my servlet for sending a mail but when some issue occurs it still executes my next line.the next i have called a success page.it always goes to that page "blank replaceall throwing null pointer exception i faced null pointer exception while using replaceall api of string class...then i tried with small snippet pasted below, i am getting npe...    string s = ""hello @world@ i am."";.    system.out.println(s.replaceall(""@world@"", null)) ; ...i also, found that in string.blank class..  public matcher appendreplacement(stringbuffer sb, string replacement) {.        .......//code..        while (cursor &lt; replacement.length()) { ..//code}.        .......//code.}...so here it calls replacement.length() which is cause of npe...is there rule that we can't pass second argument as null?..i am aware that what jvm will replace if your replacing word is null."
