"blank math operations on variable number of arguments i'm new at starting object oriented programming. i have tried to find a topic that would answer my questions, but i haven't seem to find my answers yet. i hope i'll get help ^^..i am trying to understand something. i have the following class:..      class employee {..            private string sin ; // format ""123 456 789"", ex : ""250 343 567"".            private double salweek ; // example 1075.25 $.            . . . constructors to write . . ..            . . . other methods to write . . .} // end of employee class ...i have to create the following constructors:..      employee emp1 = new employee(""321 498 726"", 987.50); // 987.50$ is total salary for week.      employee emp2 = new employee(""135 444 321"", 45.00, 20.00); /* 45 hr x 20$/hr. .                                                                 900.00 $ is total salary for week*...and i have to print informations on the second employee with the following method: ..      emp2.print(""informations of second employee"");...to get..      sin: 135 444 321.      weekly salary: 900.00$ per week...i am a bit confused since i have two entering arguments for the salary (45 and 20) on which i was thinking doing a math operation (45*20). i just don't seem to understand how to do it...i then have to modify and print emp1 salary using emp2 salary and adding 123.25$ (giving a total of 1023.25$)...is it possible to let me know how i could do it? i have code parts if needed...thank you!..here is the code i have so far: ..public class employee {..  private string sin ;.  private double salweek;..  public string getnas() {..    return nas;.    }..  public double getsalweek() { //needs work since emp2 has 2 arguments..    /*i was thinking here of adding math operation to get second and third argument and make multiplication if salary has 2 arguments*/..    return salweek;.    }..  public static void main(string[] args) {..    employee emp1 = new employee(""321 498 726"", 987.50);.    employee emp2 = new employee(""135 444 321"", 45.00, 20.00); //weekly salary is 45 * 20..    emp2.display(""informations on second employee"");.        system.out.printf(""nas: %sn"",emp2.getnas());.        system.out.printf(""weekly salary:        %dn"",emp2.getsalweek());.        }.    }...edit: clarification on variables + code part. code part is not complete and needs work."
