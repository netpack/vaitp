"best way to make a thread start from a jbutton? i have 15 different threads running all with dynamic input from the user. i need these threads to run only when my jbutton is pressed. i know i didnt supply the code for the button but its just a simple deceleration...jbutton jbutton_button1 = new jbutton(""start"");..to clarify one more time i just want the thread to start only when jbutton_button1 is clicked..new thread() {.        int counter = 10;.        public void run() {.            while(counter &gt;= 0) {.                jlabel_mistyvaleloot.settext(""test"" + (counter--));.                try{.                    thread.sleep(1000);.                } catch(exception e) {}.            }.        }.    }.start();"
