"how do i get the string scanner to wait? i have been trying to get this thing to work but it doesn't. i want to replace the int scanner to a string scanner, but when i do that, it doesn't wait for the user to put in his answer.    ..system.out.println(""ditt val: ""+ prov.getcategoryname(nval-1));.cat = prov.getcategory(nval-1);.int ncorrectanswers = 0;..for(int i = 0; i &lt; cat.nnumquestions; i++){.    system.out.print(cat.taskarray[i].squestion +"": "");.    int nmyanswer = scan.nextint();..    if(nmyanswer == 1){.        ncorrectanswers++;.    }.}...let's say i have 3 questions and if i have int it waits for the user to put in a answer to each question but if i have string it just print out the 3 questions directly..how do i use the string nmyanswer = scan.nextline(); so it waits for the user to answer the question."
