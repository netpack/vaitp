"where are the blank.net.httpurlconnection default timeouts documented? the blank.net.httpurlconnection class allows you to set a connect timeout and a read timeout. however, the blankdoc page does not specify what the values of the read and connection timeouts are if you do not specify them...are the default connect and read timeouts documented anywhere? i was able to determine them empirically by writing a simple program:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    try {.        url url = new url(""http://www.example.com"");.        urlconnection conn = url.openconnection();.        system.out.println(string.format(""connection timeout: %d"", conn.getconnecttimeout()));.        system.out.println(string.format(""read timeout: %d"", conn.getreadtimeout()));.    } catch (ioexception e) {.        e.printstacktrace();.        system.exit(1);.    }.}...(on macos and linux, for the version of blank 1.8 i was running these were both 0, meaning no timeout)...however, what i would really like is a url with official documentation on this."
