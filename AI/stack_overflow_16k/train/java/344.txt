"blank formatting for homework so i am taking an intro blank class and so far i am enjoying it. i have a project for the class that i'm working in that is supposed to use the blank diag boxes to ask for user input to create a character for a video game and generate health and currency for the character...i've got everything finished except when the characters health is generated it is supposed to stop at two decimal places but no matter what i do to tweak my decimalformat code i can't get it to stop there...here is my code:..// this imports the gui.import blankx.swing.joptionpane;.import blank.text.*;..// this is the class declaration.public class charactergen.{.    public static void main(string[] args).    {.        // these are variable declarations.        final double base_currency = 10.55;.        final int base_health = 50;.        int minhealthbonus = 1;.        int maxhealthbonus = 5;..        // this string dictates what is displayed.        // in the input box title, the dialog box,.        // and the type of dialog box.        string charname;.        charname = joptionpane.showinputdialog(null,.            ""enter your character's name"", .            ""welcome to legendary epics!"",.            joptionpane.question_message);..        int startinghealth = 50 + (int) (math.random() * 5);.        double startingcurrency = 10.55 - (double) (math.random() * 1);.        decimalformat df = new decimalformat(""#.##"");.        system.out.printf(""%.2s"", startingcurrency);..        joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null,.            ""your name is "" + charname.                + "" your starting health is "" + startinghealth.                + "" your starting currency is "" + startingcurrency,.            ""your character stats"",.            joptionpane.information_message);.    }.}...if you guys could take a look, any help would be greatly appreciated!"
