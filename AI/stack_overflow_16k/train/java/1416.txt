"how to return a boolean value that lets you know wether or not two circles overlap i am currently working on a project for my blank class where i have to make a method to take in a circle that is being called an ""animal"" as an argument. ..with this argument i then have to return a boolean value indicating whether or not the two ""animals"" overlap. note: to know if the circles are overlapping, there centers must be less than one radius apart. i'm not really sure how to start this and whether or not i should be using an if statement or not. any and all help would be greatly appreciated."
