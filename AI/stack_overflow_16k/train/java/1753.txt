"intercept an exception being caught too much caffeine led to this. yeah, you can actually catch it, but jokes aside...public class greasedupdeafguy extends runtimeexception {..    public greasedupdeafguy() {.        super(""you can't catch me!"");.    }..    @override.    public void printstacktrace() {.        throw this;.    }.}...purely as a thought experiment, is there some way to hook in to the 'catch' ?..try {.    throw new greasedupdeafguy(); // this line itself is creepy.}.catch(greasedupdeafguy e) {} // &lt;-- how could one hook in to this call? ...such that a devious developer could keep throwing this exception on? a friend suggested that the stack building could be the place to intercept but we can't figure out how. one assumes that blank protects itself against such idiocy, but i aim to be the biggest idiot i can be...i'm not suggesting that the exception class itself can do this. none of the methods in the exception are called when 'catch' is invoked. ..we have to go deeper."
