"what is difference between initialized variable and a literal in blank? i am learning blank, while studying literals in blank i found that literals can be of any datatype (int,boolean,char,etc.) and declared as ..int decval = 26;   //am i declaring literal correctly?...as far as i know, a literal is fixed value and above declaration is very similar to initialization of a variable of 'int' type. to confirm, i tried following code...public class literalchecking {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        int i=2;..        for(i=2;i&lt;5;i++).        {.            system.out.println(""i= ""+i);.        }.    }.}...where, i got output as:..i=2.i=3.i=4...now i am confused between the literal and initialization, are both same?.can some one explain me the difference?"
