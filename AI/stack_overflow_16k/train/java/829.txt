"what did i do wrong in my program? i am writing a program where if someone types in the following two lines:..hello, i’d like to order a fzgh ..kid’s meal..the program will output it like this:..hello, i’d like to order a kid’s meal ..in other words, the ""fzgh"" the user inputs into the sentence will be replaced with the second line's words, as you can see: the ""fzgh"" is replaced by ""kid's meal."" kinda get what i mean? if not, i can elaborate more but this is the best i can explain it as...i'm really close to solving this! my current output is: hello, i’d like to order a fzgh kid’s meal..my program didn't replace the ""fzgh"" with ""kid's meal,"" and i don't know why that is. i thought that by using the .replaceall() thingy, it would replace ""fzgh"" with the ""kid's meal,"" but that didn't really happen. here is my program so far:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    sentences();.}..public static void sentences() {.    scanner console = new scanner(system.in);.    string sentence1 = console.nextline();.    string sentence2 = console.nextline();.    //system.out.println(sentence1 + ""n"" + sentence2);.    string word = sentence1.replaceall(""[fzgh]"", """");.    word = sentence2;.    system.out.print(sentence1 + word);..}...where did i mess up, resulting in the fzgh still appearing in output?"
