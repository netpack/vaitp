"when are curly braces not required for multi-line loop bodies? why does this code behave correctly? i've been told that multi-line loop bodies should always have curly braces..public class sample {..    public static void main(string[] args).    {.        int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};..        // print out whether each number is.        // odd or even.        for (int num = 0; num &lt; 10; num++).            if (num % 2 == 0).                system.out.println(num + "" is even"");.            else.                system.out.println(num + "" is odd"");.    }.}"
