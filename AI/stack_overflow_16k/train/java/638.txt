"generating 2 values from one method i need to be able have the value of number and numbercount from the method for input method...the assignment i am doing is this... ..design and implement a blank program that will gather a floating point numbers and determine the sum and average of the data entered. the program should use separate methods for inputting the data, calculating the sum, calculating the average, and displaying the results. a sentinel value should be used to indicate the user has completed entering their numbers.  the output should display a message that includes the count of the numbers entered, the sum of the numbers and the average of the numbers. if the sum of the numbers is greater than 100, a warning message should be displayed indicating “values have exceeded a sum 100”....additional requirements include:...a.       use joptionpane.showinputdialog() methods for your user to input their data..b.      use joptionpane.showmessagedialog() methods to display your messages. ..this is what i have so far... ..// import blankx joptionpane.import blankx.swing.joptionpane;..// create class.public class test {..  // main method.  public static void main(string[] args) {..  // initialize values.  int numbercounter = 0;.  int count;..  double sum = 0;.  double number = 0;.  double average;..  double numberstring=0;.  number = readdouble(numberstring, number, sum, numbercounter);.  numbercounter = read1double(numberstring, number, sum, numbercounter);..  // initiate loop if user entered at least one value display average, count, sum.  if ( numbercounter != 0 ) {..   // promote numbercounter to double and calculate average of all numbers entered.   average = avg(sum, numbercounter);..   // calculate count.   count = numbercounter;..   // display average, count and sum..   joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, ""sum of numbers input : "" + sum + ""ncount of   .    numbers : "" + count + ""naverage of numbers : "" + average);.   }.    // initiate loop if sum exceeds 100 display message.    if ( sum &gt;= 100 ) {.    joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, ""the sum of inputed numbers exceeds 100!"");.    }.  }..  // average method.  private static double avg(double s, double c) {.  return (s/c);.  }..  // sum method.  private static double sum(double s, double c) {.  return (s+c);.  }..  // input method.  private static double readdouble(double i, double number, double sum, int numbercounter) {..    // acquire first number from user.    string numberstring;.    numberstring = joptionpane.showinputdialog(.    ""enter integer number :"" );.    number = double.parsedouble( numberstring );..      // initiate loop until stopped by user by using sentinel value of -1.      while ( number != -1 ) {.      sum = sum(sum, number);.      numbercounter = numbercounter + 1;..      // acquire the remaining numbers from user until stopped.      numberstring = joptionpane.showinputdialog(.      ""enter integer number or -1 if no more numbers to insert :"" );.      number = double.parsedouble( numberstring );.      }.    return number;   .  }.  }.}...thanks a ton for the responses, but could i get like an example of how it would be used in my script? im so confused, with little sleep and everything the last day has been this assignment im pretty fried. haha blank sure can wear you down...and yeah it doesn't work but i need the values from the input method in my main method so the output data is correct...my class has yet to do arrays yet, so my instructor is expecting something less than an array."
