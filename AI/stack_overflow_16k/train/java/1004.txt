"blank program about ("" "")'s importance as you can see in the code comment below, i am wondering about the  "" ""'s importance in the program below. i tried to run the program without. "" ""and the count still stayed at 0 so it seems that "" "" seems pretty important. i thought """"'s function was putting space between string. what is it doing here? thank you so much!..package js01;..import blank.util.scanner;..//search 1 .//user input of an alphabet and a sentence, return a count of that alphabet.public class j0306_search {.     public static void main(string[] args) {.         string str1;.         string ch;.         //must be a string type although the input will be a chracter because the user input is taken as a string .         int count=0;.         int i;..         scanner s=new scanner (system.in);.         system.out.println(""enter a sentence"");.         str1=s.nextline();.         system.out.println(""enter an alphabet that u would like to count"");.         ch=s.next();..         for (i=0;i&lt;str1.length();i++) {..             if (ch.equals(""""+str1.charat(i))) {..                 //why is """" needed?.                 //.                 count++;.             }.         }.         system.out.println(""count is:""+count);.         s.close();.     }..}"
