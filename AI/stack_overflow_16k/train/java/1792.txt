"how to reschedule a task using a scheduledexecutorservice? i saw this in the blank docs: scheduledatfixedrate, it says ...  if any execution of the task.  encounters an exception, subsequent.  executions are suppressed...i don't want this to happen in my application. even if i see an exception i would always want the subsequent executions to occur and continue. how can i get this behavior from scheduledexecutorservice."
