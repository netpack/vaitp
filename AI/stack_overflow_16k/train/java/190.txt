"how should lists be cast to their conrecte implementations? let's suppose i'm using a library for which i don't know the source code. it has a method that returns a list, like so:..public list&lt;someobj&gt; getobjs() { ... }...i'm wondering if this is a good idea:..arraylist&lt;someobj&gt; objs = (arraylist&lt;someobj&gt;) getobjs();...if, for example, the concrete implementation of the list inside getobjs() is a linkedlist then wouldn't there be some kind of type discrepancy?"
