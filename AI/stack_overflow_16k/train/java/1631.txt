"how can i split binary into 4 bytes sections? i have a char holding different characters, and i would like to print the binary value of these into two 4 bytes sections. i am adding a 1 at the beginning so that they would be 4 each...    system.out.println(1 + integer.tostring(mychar[i],2));...i am using a for loop to go through the different characters and create a table. by doing this i can get the binary value plus the one. but i don't know how to separate it into two 4 bytes. ..lets assume that mychar[i] holds the string bryan. the output should be the following... b    1110 0010. r    1111 0010. y    1111 1001. a    1110 0001. n    1110 1110"
