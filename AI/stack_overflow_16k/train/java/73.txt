"wage arithmetic returns wrong answer public double totalwages(double hours, double rate).  {.    double wages;.    if (hours &lt;= 40){.        wages = hours * rate;.    }.    else {.        wages = ((hours * rate) + ((hours - 40) * (1.5 * rate)));.    }.    return wages;. }...basically, if a person works overtime hours (above 40 hours), their rate will be 1.5 times their original rate for the overtime hours, so if someone works 45 hours for 12.5) dollars per hour, they would earn $593.75. ..my first case is working (hours &lt;= 40), but the second case seems to be returning the wrong answer for the example above (it is returning $656.25). is there something wrong with my operators, or maybe the way i wrote the equation according to blank syntax?"
