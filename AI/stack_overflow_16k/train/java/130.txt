"multiple the sum of digit of a number i am having a hard time figuring out the solution to this problem. i need to write a program that gets an input n (via scanner), then goes with a for loop till that input number, checks if the numbers are divisible by 13 and then multiplies the digits of each number...so for an example, if the input number is 40, the divisible numbers by 13 would be 13, 26, 39..1+3 = 4,.2+6 = 8,.3+9 = 12...so that's 4*8*12 = 384...my current code, but i'm stuck here. i probably didn't do it right, too:..scanner myscanner = new scanner(system.in);..int num = myscanner.nextint();.int sum = 0;..for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; i = i + 1) {.    if (i % 13 == 0) {.        while (i &gt; 0) {.            int add = i % 10;.            sum = sum + add;.            i = i / 10;.        }.    }.}"
