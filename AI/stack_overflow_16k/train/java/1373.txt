"blank, object-independent null return given blank source code and a preprocessor (like c++), i would like to replace all mentions of null with a function that returns null. it finds a call to null and replaces it with the following function...public static object returnnull(){.    return null;.}...this fails because there are varied classes and:..functionthatwantscustomclass( returnnull() ); //object cannot be converted to customclass...or..if( cc == returnnull() ) //object cannot be converted to customclass...etc...easiest solution i can imagine is having to parametrize the preprocessor, although that would require going through every single null to add the parameter maually, eg: null/*customclass*/...another method is spending a lot of time writing a much better parser so it always knows the required class for a returntypednull() function...is there a way to get through this error with minimal modification/parsing?"
