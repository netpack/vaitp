"simple client/server application exchanging msg my question here is how to exchange msg between clients ?.how can i develop method for text messages should be exchanged between them until the client sends ""bye"" or ""quit""..this is the code for the server..public socketserver(int port) {.    this.port = port;.}..public void start() throws ioexception {.    system.out.println(""starting the socket server at port:"" + port);.    serversocket = new serversocket(port);..    //listen for clients. block till one connects..    system.out.println(""waiting for clients..."");.    socket client = serversocket.accept();..    //a client has connected to this server. send welcome message.    sendwelcomemessage(client);.}..private void sendwelcomemessage(socket client) throws ioexception {.    bufferedwriter writer = new bufferedwriter(new outputstreamwriter(client.getoutputstream()));.    writer.write(""hello. you are connected to a simple socket server. what is your name?"");.    writer.flush();       .    writer.close();.}...and this for the client..public socketclient(string hostname, int port){.    this.hostname = hostname;.    this.port = port;.}..public void connect() throws unknownhostexception, ioexception{.    system.out.println(""attempting to connect to ""+hostname+"":""+port);.    socketclient = new socket(hostname,port);.    system.out.println(""connection established"");.}..public void readresponse() throws ioexception{.    string userinput;.    bufferedreader stdin = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(socketclient.getinputstream()));..    system.out.println(""response from server:"");.    while ((userinput = stdin.readline()) != null) {.        system.out.println(userinput);.    }.}"
