"static number of keys and values in blank hashmap i have a hashmap initialized in this way:..mymap = new hashmap&lt;integer, integer&gt;();.for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {.    mymap.put(i, 0);.}...i don't want to be able to add anymore keys to this map, but i do want to be able to change the values. if i am not mistaken an immutable hashmap would not allow me to do the latter. is there anyway to do this?"
