"exception handling without try block i think this is correct... when an exception occurs an object of the exception class is thrown and if we dont use a try or catch block, then the object goes to the jvm. .                                                                                   my question is why is the try block necessary, why wouldn't a catch block be good enough since the exception object is not created in the try block? i know that blank requires you to use a try block to test the code in which the exception might occur, but was wondering if the exception object is created either way, then why couldn't a catch block been sufficient enough. this question is different from other exception handling questions in that it doesn't appear anyone has asked about needing to have the try block specifically."
