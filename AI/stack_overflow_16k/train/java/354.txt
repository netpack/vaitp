"simulate url entering on blank so i have a problem where if i type this link on the browser and hit enter, an activation happens. i just want to do the same through blank. i don't need any kind of response from the url. it should just do the same as entering the url on a browser. currently my code doesn't throw an error, but i don't think its working because the activation is not happening. my code:..        public static void enablemachine(string dns){.     try {.            string req= ""http://""+dns+""/username?username=sputtasw"";.            url url = new url(req);.            urlconnection connection = url.openconnection();.            connection.connect();.            /*bufferedreader br = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(url.openstream()));.            string strtemp = """";.            while (null != (strtemp = br.readline())) {.                system.out.println(strtemp);.            }*/.        } catch (exception ex) {.            ex.printstacktrace();.        }.}...what's the problem?"
