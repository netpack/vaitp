"how to create a cmd process and send commands to it in blank i want to create a cmd process and send inputs to it and then output the information that is displayed in the process. are there any external jars that would allow me to do this? ..i have tried using runtime but i can only run the maximum of one command at a time before the process is closed...runtime rt = runtime.getruntime();..{ .    public static void main(string[] args) .    { .        try.        {  .         // we are running ""dir"" and ""ping"" command on cmd .         runtime.getruntime().exec(""cmd /c start cmd.exe /k ""dir &amp;&amp; ping localhost""""); .        } .        catch (exception e) .        { .            system.out.println(""hey buddy ! u r doing something wrong ""); .            e.printstacktrace(); .        } .    } .}...i need it so the command prompt remains open as i will be running an exe file which outputs different information depending what commands are input."
