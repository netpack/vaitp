"i need to use the "" symbol in blank i'm having some hard trouble finding the answer for this..is there anyway to use the "" symbol in blank without it assumes that is a text... the ideal i think would be to save the "" to a string...can it be done?..i need it because of this, the call of the script is working in dreamweaver..onchange=""album(this.value,'albumalvo')""...but i'm using a blankscript call in a dynamic webpage generated by blank, and for printing the page am changing the "" to ' ending with this as example:..""&lt;table width='100%' border='0' cellspacing='3' cellpadding='0' class='t1'&gt;""+.    ""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;""+...that changes my call to..    onchange='album(this.value,'albumalvo')'&gt;...and this way doesnt work. apparently i really need the "" to make this work. anyone can help me please?..edited: just a clearing, this question is about blank and coding in a blank environment in a blank *.class, in a project for google app engine that uses blank that prints html web-pages. the only reason why blankscript is here is that in fact i needed to call a method from the webpage that was printed by the blank web application, but that was irrelevant cause my doubt was for the use of the "" symbol. i thank all for the quick answer."
