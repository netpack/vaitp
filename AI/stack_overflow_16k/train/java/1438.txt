"is assigning a frequently used field to a local variable more efficient? i was reading the source of blank.util.hashmap and noticed it almost always assign the table field to a local variable if the value is used more than once in the method...since this class is documented to be not thread-safe and the field is not volatile, what's the point of this? does it make the code more efficient?"
