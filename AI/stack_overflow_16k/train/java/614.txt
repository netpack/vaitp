"restarting program at midnight every day probably rather simple question, that i haven't been able to find out how to do. what i want to do is simply restarting my blank application every day at midnight. so i'm imagining something that checks for the current data every minute and if the new date greater than the initial date, then the following is executed: ..try {.    runtime.getruntime().exec(""blank -jar fxmonitor.jar"");.} catch (ioexception e) {.    e.printstacktrace();.}.system.exit(0);...any hints greatly appreciated."
