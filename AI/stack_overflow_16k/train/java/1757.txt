"how can i sort arrays of various sizes in blank? like 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000 elements? i need to sort arrays of varying sizes. these sizes are: 10 elements, 50 elements, 100 elements, 500 elements, and 1000 elements. for each of these array sizes, i should use one array that is already sorted, another array that is partially sorted, and one that is random. i should use three sorts, like quicksort, insertion, or bubblesort. i have been working this for 2 weeks but can not seem to create an call the arrays."
