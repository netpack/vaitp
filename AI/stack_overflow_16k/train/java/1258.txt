"how can i pipe the blank console output to file without blank web start? i am wanting to pipe the blank console output (generated by system.out.println and its ilk) to a file. i found an excellent solution here to enable blank tracing, but this isn't working for me (no log file shows up in any location on mac os x or windows). from what i can tell, this is because i'm using a plain blank app without blank web start. so how can i do this with blank code that does not use blank web start? ideally, i would like a solution that does not require modifying code."
