"can i use value of a local variable defined in a method, in other method in blank? (please read before down voting.) the method is not returning the value of the local variable...can i use the value of local variable index from the following method     ..public boolean contains(object input) {.    int index = 0;..    while(myasetiterator.hasnext()) {.        index++;.        if(input.equals(myasetiterator.next())) {.            return true;.        }.    }.    return false;.}...in this method as the index of the array of the object that i want to remove...public boolean remove(object o) {.    int count = 0;.    if(o == null) {.        return false;.    }.    if(contains(o)) {.        genarray[index] == null;.    }.    if (count &gt; 0) {.        system.out.println(count+"" same elements were present in aset. "".                + ""removed all those ""+count+"" elements from aset."");.        return true;.    }.    return false;.}...i know the scope of a local variable is limited to the method it's declared in. but there might be a way that i might not now yet to make this happen without using a field/instance variable. i am not so new at programming but i definitely don't know all the little tricks and tips the gurus have to offer.  worth a shot. thanks for your time."
