"how to avoid counting the repeated vowel? i have written the code for the first part, but it counts the number of vowels with repetitions included, but i also want to know how to count the number of vowels without repetitions...also i am struggling to write the second part of the code, that is, report the sum of vowels...here's what i have written so far:..import blank.io.*;.public class countvowel {..    public static void main(string[] args) throws ioexception {.        bufferedreader br = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(system.in));.        system.out.println(""enter the string:"");.        string s = br.readline();.        int l = s.length();.        char ch;.        int i;.        int count = 0;.        for(i = 0; i &lt; l; i++).        {.            ch = s.charat(i);.            if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u').            {.                count=count+1;.            }.        }.        system.out.println(""the number of vowels are:""+count);.    }.}"
