"ternary string to node class i have an interview question that still kills my mind, please help...you have to write a method in blank with a string parameter..that string should be a tree of ternary operators (a?b:c). so basically it can be something like:a? g?h:j ? u?v:w : p : r?s:t...                            a.                          /   .                     g?h:j     r?s:t .                    /     .               u?v:w       p...something like that, i hope i even wrote it right, because i am really confused...then we have a class node that has 2 fields: left and right:..class node {.     char variablename;         .     node left, right;.}...so you have to return a node with all the nodes(left, right) from that string...i hope this is understandable. if you need more information i will provide, but the basic idea here is to get all the nodes right. i was trying to do this using recursion and i still believe that this is right. but i cannot figure out how to do it right."
