"creating a blank (for desktop) flashcards program i am in the process of designing my first real blank program for desktop that will be a flashcards program, that will later be transferred to android. my question is this - what would be the best option to save the user's flashcards and keep them on file so when the user opens the program again, his flashcards will be there until deleted (by the user)."
