"how to add to a list which is stored in a beanmap? i have a beanmap representing an object, one of the fields of this object is a list and i would like to be able to add to this. at the minute the code will simply take an existing list and put the full list into the beanmap. but if i want to add items to the list later on they override the items that were there as a new list is being put into the beanmap. ..so far i've tried getting the list from the beanmap but it will not allow me to use the beanmap.get method and assign a new string to this return result. you can do so for a object though. ..i also tried getting it an as object and using arrays.aslist() to manipulate it. but this did not work either. ..what i've currently tried:..object listobject = mybeanmap.get(""thelist"");.arrays.aslist(listobject).add(""some string"");.mybeanmap.put(""thelist"", listobject);...i'm looking for a way to add items to that list whilst keeping the currently existing ones."
