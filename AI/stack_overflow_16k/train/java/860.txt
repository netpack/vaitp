"unable to fix a null pointer exception in blank i have looked at this question here and followed the answers. yet the compiler is still complaining about a null pointer exception. here is my code blocks as to where the compiler is complaining:..public class readlogger {.    dlqpush dlqpush = new dlqpush();.    public string values[];.    int condition = 2;.    public bufferedreader reader = null;..public void readfile() {.    try {.        reader = new bufferedreader(new filereader(.                ""/var/tmp/checkresults.log""));.    } catch (filenotfoundexception e) {.        system.err.println(""error: file not found!n"");.    }.    string str = null;.    try {.        while ((str = reader.readline()) != null) {.            if (str.trim().length() == 0) {.                continue;.            }.            values = str.split(""t"");.            system.out.println(values[1] + values[2]);.            classifystatus();..        }.    } catch (ioexception e) {.        e.printstacktrace();.    }.}...the compiler is specifically complaining about this line:..while ((str = reader.readline()) != null) {...and here is my main class:..import blank.io.ioexception;.//import org.dcm4che3.tool.storescu.*;..public class main {..    /**.     * @param args.     * @throws ioexception .     */.    public static void main(string[] args) {..        readlogger rlog = new readlogger();.        rlog.readfile();.    }.}...i have made the necessary fixes described in the link to the previous questions, yet my compiler is still complaining about it:..error: file not found!..exception in thread ""main"" blank.lang.nullpointerexception.    at readlogger.readfile(readlogger.blank:25).    at main.main(main.blank:13)...nevermind the error as i have exported this to a jar file and put it in linux and yet it still throws a nullpointer in linux. does anyone have any ideas as to how to fix the nullpointer exception?"
