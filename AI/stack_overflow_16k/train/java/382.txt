"how do i tell if a class is equal to or extends another class (blank) so i am writing a minecraft mod in which i have successfully added a pistol which works with allot of support classes that handle things like raytracing and sounds and gui overlays. while the pistol works perfectly, i would like to add support for other mods to add their own weapons using my weapon class as a base class. my problem is how do i get my support classes to know if an item class is actually a custom class that extends my weapon class. basically what i need to be able to tell is if an instance of a class can be cast to my weapon class for processing using my weapon's base data and functions (note that i am given an instance of the item class which my weponitem class extends). does anyone know of a good way to do this?"
