"problems writing to and reading from a file i am new to programming (sorry if i ask an easy question) and i have a problem with my program dealing with writing to and reading from a file. to start off i ask the user what they want their username and password to be. then to simply check if what i was doing was correct, i tried to read the file and then print out the same information. here is my code:..public void createaccount().{.    try.    {.        filewriter doc = new filewriter(""username.ctxt"", true);.        system.out.print(""enter your desired username: "");.        myusername = keyboard.next();.        system.out.println();.        system.out.print(""enter your desired password: "");.        mypassword = keyboard.next();.        system.out.println();.        string doc2 = myusername + "" "" + mypassword + ""n"";.        doc.write(doc2, 0, doc2.length());.        doc.close();.    }.    catch(ioexception e).    {.        system.out.println(""error: "" + e.getmessage());.   }..   retrieveaccount();.}..public void retrieveaccount().{.    try.    {.        bufferedreader reader = new bufferedreader(new filereader(""username.ctxt""));//.        string user = new string("""");//username.        string pass = new string("""");//password.        int stop;.        string line = null;..        system.out.print(""enter your username: "");//allows computer to search through file and find username.        username = keyboard.next();.        while ((line = reader.readline()) != null) .        {.            scan = reader.readline();.            stop = scan.indexof("" "");.            user = scan.substring(0, stop);.            system.out.println(user);.            pass = scan.substring(stop + 1);.            system.out.println(pass);.            if(user.equals(myusername)).            {.                system.out.println(""your password is: "" + pass);.                break;.            }.        }.    }.    catch(ioexception a).    {.        system.out.println(""error: "" + a.getmessage());.    }.}...so what i want to happen is:..enter desired username: jake101.enter desired password: coolkid..enter your username: jake101.your password is: coolkid...but what actually happens is, is and out of bounds exception(-1)..this is happening because when i use indexof("" ""); it searches for a space. and when it returns negative 1 it means there is no space. what i believe is happening is that i am not writing to the same document i am trying to read from. if anybody can help me figure out what i am doing wrong this would help!"
