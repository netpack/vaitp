"running a .bat/ .cmd file from blank i wanted to run a .cmd file from blank. i have something which works for me. can someone help me understand possible failures of my program. ..import blank.io.ioexception;  ../* .  how to run a batch .bat or .cmd file from blank? .  1. i don't want the command window to open up. it should be in background. .  2. gracefully destroy any new process created. .  3. need to confirm the quality of the program with experts. . */  .public class runbat {  .    public static void main(string args[]) {  .        runtime run = runtime.getruntime();  .        //the best possible i found is to construct a command which you want to execute  .        //as a string and use that in exec. if the batch file takes command line arguments  .        //the command can be constructed a array of strings and pass the array as input to  .        //the exec method. the command can also be passed externally as input to the method.  ..        process p = null;  .        string cmd = ""d:\database\tabletocsv.cmd"";  .        try {  .            p = run.exec(cmd);  .            p.geterrorstream();  .            system.out.println(""run.completed.successfully"");  .        }  .        catch (ioexception e) {  .            e.printstacktrace();  .            system.out.println(""error.running.cmd"");  .            p.destroy();  .        }  .    }  .}  ...is my solution reliable? how can i make sure that once the .cmd is execute there is no processes hanging around. ..thanks."
