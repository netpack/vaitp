"executing code too fast..need to slow down but how? from this code below ..  if(!validate_containsnum &amp;&amp; !validate_isnumber &amp;&amp; !validate_isblankfield){.                a.sendmsgtoslave(""data:take:peoples:""+pname_sub);.                appendtoglobaldatalog(""send : data:take:peoples:""+pid+"":""+p_sub);.                string pid = pid_manage.gettext();  .                a.addtoarraylist(""data:take:peoples:""+pid+"":""+pname_sub);.                at.sendtoserver(""data:take:peoples:""+pid+"":""+pname_sub);....        }...from the code above i am having a problem where this line ..      a.sendmsgtoslave(""data:take:peoples:""+pname_sub);...is actually calling my client to  fetch data from peoples table in order to get pid in return which will be return to a jtextfield where the next line should be executed..     string pid = pid_manage.gettext();  ...but then as for the next line job is to add certain string into an arraylist which has the combination of pid and pname_sub but then when executed it i found out my arraylist did not have the pid..so instead of the real result should be something like this..     data:take:peoples:1:albert  (in my arraylist)...it shows like this..     data:take:peoples::albert (the id is missing)...i need to resubmit again the 2nd time only can get the id...it seems like the execution of the code is too fast and the storing of id in return to the jtextfield is slow..any way to slow it down?"
