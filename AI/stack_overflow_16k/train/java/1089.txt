"the necessity of an empty constructor i've tried running the following code which gives me a constructor a in class a cannot be applied to given types error...class a{.    int a;.    a(int b){.        a = b;.    }.}..public static void main (string[] args) throws blank.lang.exception.{.    a a = new a();.    system.out.println(a.a);.}...if i remove the c'tor from class a however the code runs as expected (and outputs 0). it seems that if another c'tor exists there is no default c'tor (and an argument less c'tor exists only if it is written). am i correct?.more importantly, why is this?"
