"how can i modify a string in a class file which is in a compiled .jar with a blank program? i'm trying to code a client-builder, which means i have a client.jar and i need to change a string which is located in jar/client/main.class. the string ip_server = (value i want to change) is the only thing which should be edited. may there is a way to replace the class with a by blank builded and compiled class, but idk.the client builder is a blank program with gui (but gui isnt the problem) wich is used to create copies of the original client.jar just with changed values (ip string for example). i need this and not arguments or something cause the client.jar should be able to be given to other people when they dont know the server ip. so things like start arguments or something arent so usefull :/..i already tried to copy files into the jar, but that is not really what i need. so how can i do this with a blank program?"
