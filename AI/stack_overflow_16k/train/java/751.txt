"blank print character by character so i have used a little function called typephrase, and it allows me to give it any string, and it will print it in the console, letter by letter...public static string typephrase(string phrase) {.    for(int i = 0; i &lt; phrase.length(); i++) {.        long start = system.currenttimemillis();.        while (system.currenttimemillis() - start &lt; 50) {..        }.        system.out.print(phrase.charat(i));.    }.    return "" "";.}...i am wondering if there is a way to make a function like this, but print lots of letters at once, for instance, every 50 milliseconds it would print out 7 letters all together. the code that i am using now, prints one letter every 50 milliseconds."
