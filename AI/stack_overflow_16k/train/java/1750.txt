how do i generate a number between 0-9 or letter between a-z and then initialize it as a variable i want to make a randomizer so it chooses a either one number between 0-9 or one letter between a-z...i have already tried something like this ..random l1 = new random();.char a = (char)(l1.nextint(26) + 'a'); ...and this ..random n1 = new random();.int a = n1.nextint(10); ...but i'm curious if it is possible to combine both and still receive on output(either letter or number).
