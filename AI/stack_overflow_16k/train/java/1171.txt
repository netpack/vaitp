"max size of an email body i'm using blankmail to send out a potentially large html report. it's preferable to inline the report in the message body but sometimes the report will need to be zipped and attached..recipients can be using any mail client. given that the mail client is not fixed, i'm looking for feedback as to what will be a sensible threshold for the email body, (crossing which the report will be zipped and attached)"
