"how can a software company support developer community? i'm just preparing a local blank user group meeting to take place in a meeting room provided by my employer so that is how this question came up.....i know that some companies sponsor conferences, some hire open source developers etc. however, are there any other ways in which a software company can support its (local) developer community?"
