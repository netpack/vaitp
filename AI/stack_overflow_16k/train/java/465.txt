custom implicit conversion in blank in c# i can create my own implicit conversion for my classes as follows.....public static implicit operator typeyouwanttochangeto (classyouarechanging c)  .{ .    typeyouwanttochangeto x;.    //convert c to x.    return x;.}...how do you make a class be able to implicitly convert to another class? also in c# i can change implicit to explicit to also create the ability to cast manually. how do you accomplish this in blank?
