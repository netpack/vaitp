"unable to load resources from thread context class loader? i am trying to get the complete file path of a resource in a blank project that was given to me. the code fails to find the file by using the filename only. i need help to make it work...this is the project structure:....this is the code:..package com.testing.software.apps;..public class filetest {..    public static void main(string[]args) {.        string filename = ""orders-2017.txt"";.        string filepath = getfilepath(filename);.        system.out.println(""file path is: "" + filepath);.    }..    public static string getfilepath(string filename) {.        string fullfilepath = thread.currentthread()..                getcontextclassloader()..                getresource(filename)..                getpath();.        return fullfilepath;.    }..}...this code throws a null pointer exception in the ""getpath();"" line. i figured out that the exception occurs because this line ""getresource(filename)"" returns a null url object. upon inspecting the getresource code, i see that finally ""url = findresource(name);"" returns null...public url getresource(string name) {.    url url;.    if (parent != null) {.        url = parent.getresource(name);.    } else {.        url = getbootstrapresource(name);.    }.    if (url == null) {.        url = findresource(name);.    }.    return url;.}...looking at the definition of blank.net.url findresource, i see that it always returns null, thereby giving me a null all the time...protected url findresource(string name) {.    return null;.}...can someone please explain why this code always ends up giving null and how i can make it find the file by only using the filename?"
