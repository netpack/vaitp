"catching an error within a method that has a boolean return type i am attempting to implement a game of hex, using some interfaces i've been given. part of the implementation is notifying the user and the program that a player has attempted to place a piece upon a board co-ordinate (a 2d array list) that already contains a piece. this is deemed an illegal move. therefore, i am attempting to catch the exception within my placepiece() method which assigns a piece to some given co-ordinates. piece is an enumerated class which contains three elements: blue, red, unset. initially i set the board to unset. i need the method to notify the user and the system of a positionalreadytakenexception should the co-ordinates contain anything other piece.unset. can anyone help me do this as at the moment the method is just skipping to the last return true; line of code? ..here is the code for my makemove() method: .. public boolean placepiece(piece colour, moveinterface move) throws positionalreadytakenexception, invalidpositionexception, invalidcolourexception.{.       int x = move.getxposition();.       int y = move.getyposition(); ..       try {.        if(this.board [y-1][x-1] == piece.unset){.         this.board[y-1][x -1] = colour;  .         return true; .        }..    } catch (exception e){.        return false; .    }    .    return true; .}"
