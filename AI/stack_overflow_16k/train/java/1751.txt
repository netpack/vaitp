"custom library gives ""no package found"" i decided to make a custom .jar library just for the hell of it...it's insanely basic, it's package name is ""add"" and looks like this:..public class addtogether{.      public void addtogether(int a, int b, int c){.      c=a+b.      }}...so i try importing it in a file, by doing this:..public class test{.import add.*;.public static void main (string[]        args){.int x;.add(4,5,x);.system.out.println(x);.}.}...and surprise surprise! no package found...i did the whole dance of adding it to the ide in the preferences section, but it still doesn't work...help please."
