"my loop is wrong. brand new to blank. any insight as to where i am going wrong? i am supposed to calculate coins i am working on a project that calculates the number of coins used to produce a certain total of change. for some reason, my output is only reading this: .quarters:.dimes: .end. ..it doesn't print the integer being calculated, and does not continue past dimes. i have tried using different loops and print statements, but am at a loss. any insight of hints would be greatly appreciated.../*. * to change this license header, choose license headers in project     properties.. * to change this template file, choose tools | templates. * and open the template in the editor.. */.package minimumcoinsproject;.import blank.util.scanner;. /**. *.  * @author user.  */. public class minimumcoinsproject {../**. *. * @author . */.static public class minumimcoinsproject//a class is not an object, but a     blueprint for an object. it is the building blocks..{..}.public static void main(string[] args) {.    // todo code application logic here.    { //initialization..        int change = 0;.        int quarters = 0;.        int dimes = 0;.        int nickels = 0;..    scanner in;.    in = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.println(""lets calclulate the minimum coins.n"");.    system.out.println(""please enter amount of change.(1-99)n"");.    change=in.nextint(); //asks for the amount of change to calculate...    //start of while loop.        while  ( change &gt;= 25).    {.        quarters = quarters+1;.        change = quarters - 25;.        system.out.printf(""quarters:n"", quarters);.    } .        if (10 &gt;= change).    {..        dimes = dimes + 1;.        change = change - 10;.        system.out.printf(""dimes: n"", dimes);..    }.        if  (change &gt;=5) .    {..        nickels = nickels + 1;            .        change = change - 5;.        system.out.printf(""nickles: n"",nickels);..    }.        if ( change == 0).        system.out.printf(""pennies: n"", change);.    }.}...}"
