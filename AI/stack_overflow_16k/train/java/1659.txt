"add biginteger in a loop to a list i'm stuck on a probably simple thing, but i just can't figure it out..so this is the code:..list&lt;biginteger&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;biginteger&gt;();.for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 12; i++) {.    list.add(new biginteger(""i""));.}...i get the following exception:...  exception in thread ""main"" blank.lang.numberformatexception: for input string: ""i""...i don't understand it, i is an integer between 1-12 and it should be convertible to a biginteger."
