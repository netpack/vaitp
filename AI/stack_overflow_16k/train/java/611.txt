"why doesn't my string comparison work? ok, this is stupid, but wtf is going on?..i have a string variable in a servlet, which takes the value of a parameter and based on that value i make a test to do something, but the if is not working. what is the problem?.. string action = request.getparameter(""action"");.    system.out.println(""action: "" + action);.// i put 2 ifs to be sure, but not even one is working.    if(action.equals(""something"")).            {.                system.out.println(""hey"");            .            }.    if(action.trim() == ""something"").            {.                system.out.println(""hey"");.            }...on the console, the system.out.println shows me that the value of action is ""something""..action: something"
