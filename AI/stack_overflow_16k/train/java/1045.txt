"instantiate object from class i am currently writing a library in which users can create own subclasses of a parent abstract class module..so the library already contains some modules written by me, for example moduleone, moduletwo, ... ..each module - subclass should be easily identifiable with an unique identifier, for example an integer, because i want to save multiple module configurations and connections in an xml file. .so i can load the saved configurations later and instanciate objects of the desired type...if i just use predefined classes this is easy, because i know the identifiers of moduleone or moduletwo, so i can create the modules in a function:..public static module getmodulebytype(int type).{.     if (type == moduleone.type).         return new moduleone();.     else if (type == moduletwo.type).         return new moduletwo();.     //and so on....}...but if a user makes a subclass of module, for example custommodule, how can i assign unique identifiers to this class, so that all instances of this class have the same type identifier?..how can i dynamically recreate these modules from their identifiers? so i cannot create the modules in getmodulebytype(), because i do not know their constructor and their identifier...thank you for your help."
