"unit testing of setters and getters teacher wanted us to do a comprehensive unit test. for me, this will be the first time that i use junit. i am confused about testing set and get methods. do you think should i test them? if the answer is yes; is this code enough for testing?..  public void testsetandget(){.    int a = 10;.    class firstclass = new class();.    firstclass.setvalue(10);.    int value = firstclass.getvalue();.    assert.asserttrue(""error"", value==a);.  }...in my code, i think if there is an error, we can't know that the error is deriving because of setter or getter."
