"calculation with jpanel.getwidth() not working note: i couldn't find an appropriate title for this question.....the class mypanel sets up a jpanel with a custom drawing on it.  in order to fit the drawing to the actual size of the jpanel which is set in another class, i need to calculate the ratio of the jpanels width or height and an int scale. .i need the decimal part of ratio because depending on it being &lt; / > 0.5 i want to treat results differently...public class mypanel extends jpanel {..    public  void setup(int px, int py, int width, int height){.        this.setbackground(color.white);.        this.setbounds(px, py, width, height);.    }..    int scale = 35;..    public int plusx(){.        double ratio = this.getheight()/scale;.        long integer;.        double fractional;.        int plusx = 0; ..        integer = (long) ratio; .        fractional = ratio - integer; .        if (fractional &gt; 0.5){.            plusx = (int) (scale*fractional);   .        }.        if (fractional &lt; 0.5 ){.            plusx = (int) (-scale*fractional); .        }.        system.out.println(""ratio: ""+ratio+ "" integer: ""+integer+"" fractional: ""+fractional+"" plusx: ""+plusx);.        return plusx;.    }.}...with the output for width = 1254, height = 648 and scale = 35 resulting in: ..ratio: 18.0 integer: 18 fractional: 0.0 plusx: 0...but 18 is just wrong, leading up to fractional = 0.0..scale*ratio should result in height (thus being for the example: 35*18.51=648 with fractional = 0.51)...no matter which value i choose for scale, ratio always remains exact .0   ."
