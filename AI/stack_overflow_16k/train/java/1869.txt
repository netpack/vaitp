"trouble finding nullpointerexception used try catch instead of if statement i've been struggling to find why my if statement didnt work properly so i used a try catch block instead. this is the if statement as i had it:..//selectartistbyname returns an artist object.if (!selectartistbyname(artist.getname()).equals(artist.getname()) || .    selectartistbyname(artist.getname())==null) {.    //save data to database.}...when i ran the above, i got a nullpointerexception because the method selectartistbyname was returning null as the database was empty. what i don't understand is why it didn't go in the if statement when i was getting null. so i did this and it worked:..try {.    if (!selectartistbyname(artist.getname()).equals(artist.getname())) {.    }.} catch (nullpointerexception e) {.    m_db.insert(table_artist, null, artistcontents);.}...i'm not a blank guru but it looks like a horrible fix to me. how could i fix this."
