"infix to postfix with real numbers (included negative ones) i made an app that allows the transformation from infix to postfix expressions for real numbers (included negative ones). it works perfectly except for the case when i put a negative number on the first and then i put minus another number. for example -1 - 2 or -2 + 8 - 9. it shows -1-2 and -2 8-9 +. it should be -1 2 - and -2 8 + 9 -. it's certainly a problem when the sign is -. this is a part of my code when the input char is '-'...for (int j = 0; j &lt; input.length(); j++) {.    char ch = input.charat(j);.    if (ch == '-') {.                    if ((ch == input.charat(0)) || (input.charat(j - 1) == '(').                            || (input.charat(j - 1) == '-')).                        temp = temp + ch;.                    else {.                        output = output + temp + "" "";.                        temp = """";.                        gotoper(ch, 1);.                    }.                }.    else if ...    ....    }...when the app find - and it's on the first of the input or after ( or after - so it's a negative number and i put it into a temporary variable. when it's between 0 and 9 or it's ., the same thing. else, when it's and operand, i put which is in temp in output and i do operations with the stack. i can't show the whole code, it's very long! can someone help me please?..edit: i did this input = input.replaceall(""\s+"", """"); to remove all whitespaces"
