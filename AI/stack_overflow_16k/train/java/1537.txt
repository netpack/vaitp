"how to create an alphabetizer in blank? i am trying to create a method in a class that alphabetizes a string[] array without using the array.sort(); method. how do i solve this problem?..i have already tried to alphabetize them using the unicode values:..attempt..each string[] follows this pattern, {last, first, amount of land(sqft), number of trees}.string[] customer1 = new string[] {jefferson, thomas, 10000, 10}.string[] customer2 = new string[] {washington, george, 5000, 11}.string[] customer3 = new string[] {jackson, andrew, 380000, 8}.string[] customer4 = new string[] {lincoln, abraham, 6200, 19}.string[] customer5 = new string[] {franklin, benjamin, 450000, 36}.string[][] allcustomers = new string[][]{customer1,customer2,customer3,customer4,customer5}...for my program, i am trying to alphabetize customer information through their last names. the code that you see above is the shortened version of what my inputs will be. the output should be alphabetized by last name and the information associated with that last name should still be in the same string[] array as the last name."
