"confused with output while working with strings     string sb1 = new string(""soft"");.    string sb2 = new string(""soft"");..    system.out.println(""ans1-&gt;"" +sb1 == sb2);.    system.out.println(sb1 == sb2 + "" after result"");.    system.out.println(""ans2-&gt;"" +sb1.equals(sb2));...this leads to output as below, but i dont understand why ""ans1"" and ""after result"" texts are not displayed. kindly help on this...false..ans2->true"
