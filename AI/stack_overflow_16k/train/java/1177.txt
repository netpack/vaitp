"how can i know the maximum number of runnable threads allowed on the current jvm? i have a multi-threaded application that runs in several different environments and i think that sometimes the environment limits the total number of threads that can be run at the same time.  in particular, i think one of the systems is only allowing a single thread to run so there is no benefit to the multi-threading.  what's an easy way to tell when this happens?..executorservice exec = executors.newfixedthreadpool(4);.testrunnable tr = new testrunnable();.for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++ ) {.  try {.     exec.execute(sr);.  } catch (exception e) {.  }.}"
