"creating a file uploader i'm not a blank programmer (i come from asp.net c#) but i'm considering writing a small blank application to upload files. in my web app, the user needs to upload a spreadsheet to my server and i want to check the file size and extension before the upload. most uploader seems overly bloated for what i'm looking to do and i want to build something really simple...what do i need to do to make this? eclipse seems to be the best ide for blank. what else do i need and how difficult would it be to write an uploader?..thanks."
