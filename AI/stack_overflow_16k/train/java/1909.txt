"difference between 1/0 and 1.0/0.0 in blank i am new in blank programming language, a stupid question comes up as below...to execute 1/0 in blank will be generated a runtime exception, as the value is undefined...but the 1.0/0.0 will be okay and the value is infinity...anything special with double data type? could help have a good explanation for understanding? thanks in advance."
