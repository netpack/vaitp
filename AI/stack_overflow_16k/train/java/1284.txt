"how to check whether a license plate is valid or not without using arrays? i was going to submit this code below but the ta said that i cannot use arrays. i'm not really sure how to do this without arrays. he said it was much simpler than what i did. ..package b4;.import blank.util.scanner;.public class b2 {.    public static boolean isalpha(string name) {.        char[] chars = name.tochararray();.        for (char c : chars) {.           if (!character.isletter(c)) {.               return false;.           }.        }.        return true;.     }..     public static void main(string[] args).     {.         scanner scn=new scanner(system.in);.         system.out.print(""enter a valid plate number: "");.         string plate=scn.next();..         if (plate.length()==5) {.             if (plate.contains(""-"")) {.                 string[] sp=plate.split(""-"");..                 if (isalpha(sp[0])&amp;&amp;sp[0].length()==2) {.                     try {.                         integer.parseint(sp[1]);.                         system.out.println(plate+"" is a a valid plate number."");.                     } catch(exception e) {.                         system.out.println(plate+"" is a an invalid plate number."");.                     }.                 } else {.                     system.out.println(plate+"" is a an invalid plate number."");.                 }.             } else {.                 system.out.println(plate+"" is a an invalid plate number."");.             }..         } else {.             system.out.println(plate+"" is a an invalid plate number."");.         }.     }.}...here was the question we were given originally which didn't mention we couldn't use arrays."
