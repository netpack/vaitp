"double ternary integer initiation causes a null pointer why is this fine with x being set to null:..boolean condition1 = false;.integer x = condition1 ? 1 : null;...and this fine with x being set to 2:..boolean condition1 = false, condition2 = true;.integer x = condition1 ? 1 : condition2? 2 : null;...but this, where x should be set to null causes a blank.lang.nullpointerexception..boolean condition1 = false, condition2 = false;.integer x = condition1 ? 1 : condition2 ? 2 : null;...a solution is to use:..integer x = condition1 ? (integer)1 : condition2 ? 2 : null;...but i'm not very clear on why a single ternary operator works fine, but not a double."
