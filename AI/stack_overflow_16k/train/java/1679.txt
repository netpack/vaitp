"how do i use a variable from a static class in another class? i's trying to build an encoder like the ""enigma machine"" and i have this code so far where i'm trying to get comboone() to use the ""s"" variable from main():..import blank.io.*;..public class main.{.    public static void main(string[] args) throws ioexception.    {.        bufferedreader br = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(system.in));.        system.out.println(""what would you like to encode?"");.        string s = br.readline();..        s.tochararray();.        system.out.println(s);..        //comboone comboone = new comboone();.    }.}...just to encode one letter i've written this:..public class comboone extends main.{.    main m = new main();.    char message = s.tochararray();.        if(message == 'a').    {.        system.out.println('b');.    }.}...i am quite new so apologies if i am making an obvious mistake but i think this would be a fun challenge for myself. please send help and thanks for helping :)"
