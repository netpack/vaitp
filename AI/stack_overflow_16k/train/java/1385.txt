"object allocation through new operator or some interface i was going through a blank code and i saw that objects have been allocated using some interface and this interface contains some methods to allocate objects using new operator. i am unable to think that why they have used an interface instead of just directly allocating objects using new operator. e.g:..animal animal = new animal();...or..animal animal = interface.allocateanimal()...here interface is an interface having a method allocateanimal which does nothing but .new animal()...so ultimately we are doing same thing but in different way so what are gaining here?..edit 1: actually interface is implemented somewhere else. so interface does not contain any implementation code, it just contains methods."
