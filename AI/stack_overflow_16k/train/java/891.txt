"searching nodelist by an array i have a document that i'm searching through for specific instances, however those instances are specified by the user and there are more than one.  other than a for loop inside a for loop searching a nodelist against an array, is there a way i'm missing that wouldn't bog down the system?  or an easier way?..so far, my code looks like this in abstract: ..public void sortdoc(document doc){.    nodelist list = doc.getfirstchild().getchildnodes();.    arraylist&lt;string&gt; typelist = othersorter.gettypes();.    for(int i=0; i&lt;list.getlength(); i++){.        for(int j=0; j&lt;typelist.size(); j++){.            if(list.item(i).getnodename()==typelist.get(j)){.                dothething();.            }.        }.    }.}...thanks for any help you can give."
