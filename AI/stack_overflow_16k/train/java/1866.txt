"updated item info in container, how do i refresh? i'm going out on a limb here, and hoping that someone has used it mill toolkit before:..i have a table with a bunch of items inside. i edit one of them â€“ how do i get the table to refresh and re-render itself? i've tried with requestrepaint(), requestrepaintall() on both the table, and the layout that contains the table, but i can't get it to refresh itself. when i reload the page, or scroll back and forth (so that the item goes from view and comes back into view), the item has been updated...is there a way to programmatically get the table to refresh its current view?"
