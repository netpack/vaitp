"printing doubles of fixed size in blank i have a matrix as follows (e.g):..1 2.1000000000000 3.15...i want to print it to a string in a way that it is properly tabulated, with each entry taking up exactly 8 places:..1.000000    2.000000.1.00e006    3.150000...i have been researching decimalformat, numberformat and figured out a way of doing it with a specific function coded by myself, but it fails when a number is written using decimal notation..any way of printing a double to a string taking up a specified number of spaces no matter how it is written (regular or scientific notation)?"
