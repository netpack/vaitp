"replace dashes with guessed letter in blank really beginner blankscript user here, creating a hangman game. i am having the world of difficulty in trying to show a users correct guess. .from my understanding i have only masked the secret word with dashes so therefor am trying to make it become unmasked when a correct letter is guessed. .i imagine i need to use charat somewhere, somehow but to be honest i just cant figure it out. ..my code is still very basic and i havent done much else as there isnt much point writing out the rest of the game if you cant see the guess but here is the code i have so far... please remember this is still a very unfinished project... package hangmangame;..import blank.util.arrays;.import blank.util.random;.import blank.util.scanner;../**.*.* @author matt. */.public class hangmangame {.../**. * @param args the command line arguments. */.public static void main(string[] args) .{.    char letter = 0; //declares and initailise letter.    string marks = """"; //declares and initailise string for dashes.    string [] words = { ""gluttony"", ""lust"", ""greed"", ""pride"", ""despair"", ""wrath"", ""vainglory"", ""rhythm"", ""delicious"", ""better"", ""jacuzzi"" , ""ironman"", ""captainamerica"", ""thor"", ""hulk"", ""spiderman"", ""antman"", ""batman""}; //declares and initailise array of words to guess.    string word = words[(int) (math.random() * words.length)]; //chooses random word from the word array.    for (int i=1;i&lt;=word.length(); i++) // for method for displaying the correct word as dashes.    {.        marks += ""-""; //dashes to represent the correct word..    }....        system.out.println(""lets play hangman, your word is "" + marks + ""n"" + ""enter a letter to guess the word"");.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.        letter = input.next(""."").charat(0); //assign inputted letter to letter variable..     if ((word).contains(""""+letter)) //if statement to excute if guessed letter is in word..         // i imagine this is where i put some sort of code to show that guessed letter?..         system.out.println(""you guessed a letter!"" + marks); //display for correct letter"
