"what is the time complexity of adding an element at the beginning of an arraylist? say i have a arraylist with n element in this array, and i add an element at the beginning:..myarraylist.add(0,'some value');...what will be the time complexity of this operation?..the blank doc doesn't specify this...also..i just start learning blank, and i saw the sentence..an arraylist in blank is a list that is backed by an array....what does 'backed' here mean? thank you!"
