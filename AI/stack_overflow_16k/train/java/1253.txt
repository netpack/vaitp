"difficulty with user-defined functions i'm new to blank and trying to learn some simple blank but am having some difficulty with the constructor. it seems that the constructor and properties i set are not being picked up by the main blank class from the cars class. even though i have used ""cars"" to reference in the main class. it also shows ""cannot resolve symbol...."" which is how i came to my conclusion. what could be causing this? ..car.blank file..import blank.awt.*;..public class car {..    double averagemilespergallon;.    string licenseplate;.    color paintcolor;.    boolean aretailingworking;..    public car(double inputaveragempg,.               string inputlicenseplate,.               color inputpaintcolor,.               boolean inputaretaillightsworking) {.        this.averagemilespergallon = inputaveragempg;.        this.licenseplate = inputlicenseplate;.        this.paintcolor = inputpaintcolor;.        this.aretailingworking = inputaretaillightsworking;..    }.}...main.blank file ..public class main {..    public static void main(string[] args) {...        car mycar = new car(inputaveragempg: 25.5,.                inputlicenseplate:""1b32e"",.                color.blue,.                inputaretaillightsworking: true);..        car sallycar = new car(inputaverampg: 13.9,.                inputlicenseplate: ""1g42d"",.                color.black..                        inputaretaillightsworking: false);..        system.out.println(""my car's license plate: "" + mycar.licenseplate);.        system.out.println(""sally's license plate: "" + sallycar.licenseplate);.    }.}"
