"filtering an inputstream on-the-fly data coming in from the input stream consists of multiple json objects on each line. i'm only interested in a small (5-8%) of the objects (hence lines) coming in from the stream, those which contain a particular json key-value combination. ..i'm reading data from the inputstream and writing it to a file. is it possible to write only those objects (i.e. lines) which match a particular simple regex? .(since the object is huge, parsing it as a json and looking for the key would be a waste of time, a regex match would be far quicker.)..this is just a wild idea, i'm not sure if this is possible at all. if it is, any tips, links, pointers?..the total data coming in is ~3tb from various different inputstreams on 40 separate hosts in emr. because of various reasons (mainly those here), i want to avoid post-processing this."
