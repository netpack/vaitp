"reading file in actionperformed method, taking answer from jtextarea, and find the right world/answer i asked a question similar to this, but it didn't really solve the problem that i am having. ..questions:...how do i get the text in the jtextarea, to be called into the actionperformed method, so that it can go through the file and search for that specific word?.the file that i have is not opening...specifically it is going straight to ""file cannot open"" part of the ""try"" statement. i am using a scanner file to search for the file to see if what they wrote is correct. how do i fix this?...what the program is suppose to do:..what i am trying to achieve with this program is that when the use presses a button on the ""game page"" of the program, it takes them to a separate page that displays a question. now the following part of the program is the question frames. it displays a label, and that works. it displays the jtextfile, but what isn't working is its not taking the jtextarea words and searching the file that i have made. after they have entered their answer and pushed the button, is suppose to make a new jlabel and display in the math100() methods frame. ..here is what i have so far coding wise:..public void actionperformed(actionevent event) .    {.        if(event.getactioncommand().equals(""answer m 100"")).        {.            try.            {.                string path = ""c:\users\nathan\desktop\answers_file.txt"";.                file answersfile = new file(path);.                scanner input = new scanner(answersfile);.                system.out.println(answersfile.getabsolutepath());.                if(input.hasnext(""1,000,000"")).                {.                    system.out.println(""this answer is correct!"");.                }.                else.                {.                    system.out.println(""this answer is incorrect."");.                }.            }.            catch(ioexception e).            {.                system.out.println(""file cannot load."");.                e.printstacktrace();.            }.        }.    }..    public static void math100().    {.        jframe m100frame = new jframe(""100 point math question"");.        m100frame.setsize(350,350);.        m100frame.setlocationrelativeto(null);.        jpanel pane = new jpanel();.        m100frame.setcontentpane(pane);..        jlabel question = new jlabel(""&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div width = 320&gt;&lt;center&gt;round 1,291,293 to the nearest thousands, and round 8.472 to the nearest hundredth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;put answers in box below, and have the word 'and' between the two answers.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/width&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"");..        jtextarea answerarea = new jtextarea("""",10,25);..        jbutton answerquestion = new jbutton(""answer m 100"");.        answerquestion.addactionlistener(new allquestions());..        pane.add(question);.        pane.add(answerarea);.        pane.add(answerquestion);..        m100frame.setvisible(true);.        m100frame.tofront();.    }...i looked at the stack trace for this part of the program, and the only part that is seems to not be working is:..at allquestions.actionperformed(allquestions.blank:16)..thanks for the help!"
