"horner data structure hi.i have a question that how can we use horner data structure for showing a polynomial which is like "" x^100+1"" ?...  for example for above polynomial we.  need array of size 101 which its index.  shows the power of this polynomial for.  example for array[100]=1 and array[0].  = 1 and unfortunately all the other indexes are 0 !!! but there is another.  way which is difference from this and.  helps to show a polynomial in a little.  array !!! and i want to know that way...thanks"
