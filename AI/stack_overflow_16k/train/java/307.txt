why doesn't blank allow to define two methods with the same signature except the generic type parameters? .  possible duplicate:.  method has the same erasure as another method in type  .....in one of my classes i wanted to define these two methods:..private void add(list&lt;changeset&gt; changesetlist) {.    for (changeset changeset : changesetlist) {.        add(changeset);.    }.}..private void add(list&lt;change&gt; changelist) {.    for (change change : changelist) {.        add(change);.    }.}...then i get the following error: ..method add(list&lt;change&gt;) has the same erasure add(list&lt;e&gt;) as another method in type dataretriever...why isn´t this allowed? what is the problem with method definitions like that? and what should i do to avoid it? i don´t want to rename one of the methods.
