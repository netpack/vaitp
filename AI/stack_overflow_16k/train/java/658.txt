"print objects to file txt i'm trying to print objects into file..then i want to import them back to my program..objectoutputstream not working, what am i missing? (try, catch not visible here but they're doing their job)..map&lt; account, customer&gt; customerinfo = new hashmap&lt; account, customer&gt;();..file bankfile = new file(""bank.txt"");.                fileoutputstream fout = new fileoutputstream( bankfile);.                objectoutputstream objout = new objectoutputstream(fout);..                for(map.entry&lt;account, customer&gt; e : bank.customerinfo.entryset()).                    {.                        objout.writeobject(e.getvalue());.                        objout.writeobject(e.getkey());.                    }..                objout.flush();.                objout.close();.                fout.close();...my problem here is that objectoutputstream is not working properly, it prints some weird code. i've used other methods to print out to file and they work just fine. ..i've tried printing to different file extensions, ..i tried changing the encoding for both the file and eclipse...i tried different methods for getting the info from the map using objectoutputstream. is there a reason why objectoutputstream prints weird characters that i haven't think of? the entire file is almost impossible to read. thanks!..ps. some of the weird print, don't know if it helps...¬ísrcustomerdìuðkj.personalidnumlnametlblank/lang/string;xpthellosr.savingaccountuþààí¾>zfreewithdrawdwithdrawalinterestratelaccounttypeq~xraccount é=uáði.accountnumberdbalancedinterestratelaccounttypeq~l   translisttlblank/util/list;xpé?zág®{tsrblank.util.arraylistxòçaisizexpw.x?zág®{tsaving accountq~sr.creditaccountý.*5&amp;­vclaccounttypeq~xq~ê?zág®{q~sq~ w.xtcredit account"
