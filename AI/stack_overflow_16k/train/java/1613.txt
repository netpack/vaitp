"how to have a break of a few seconds in execution of program this question might sound strange but i'm interested to know if somehow i can have a break of a few seconds in execution of a program.for example when you have a simple for() for printing out the elemnts of an array,the elements will be printed all directcly.i was wondering if it is possible to print like the first element then after a break of 2 second print the second one and so on until the last one.is something like this possible?"
