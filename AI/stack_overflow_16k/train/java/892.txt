"infinite while loop; input validation; don't know what to do to make it read an if before input is placed what should i do? i'm pretty new at programming so sorry for bad explanations and/or badly written code.....anyways, i'm currently working on an assignment using ""method overload"" and i want to be able to get a double or an int from the user. ..my first code worked, so i decided to add an else to the end of the last if statement that checked for bad input and reiterated the entire code. the problem is that while the code works fine when you put numbers the first time, if you put in bad input it will start the while loop and keep re-iterating the code block regardless of any input. i know that it is just ignoring the if statements because their is no previous input of any sort(or anything stopping it?). i need some way of the code checking getting the input and then checking whether it is an integer or double before declaring the variable type...or if there is some better method please share... if you need any more knowledge reply to this post or whatever...here.also, its not finished, call it a draft if you..public class loanrates {.    public static void main(string[] args){..        scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.        boolean x = false;.        while(x = true){.            system.out.println(""please enter a number"");.            x = false;.            if (in.hasnextint()){.                int rate = 0;           .                rate = getnumbers(rate, in);.                system.out.println(rate);.                break;.            } else if( in.hasnextdouble()){.                double rate = 0;.                system.out.println(""please enter a number"");.                rate = getnumbers(rate, in);.                system.out.println(rate);.                break;.            }else {                 .            system.out.print(""please enter a number"");}         .        }   .        system.out.print(""did it work?"");.    }..    public static double getnumbers(double rate, scanner in){.        rate =in.nextdouble();.        return rate;.    }..    public static int getnumbers(int rate, scanner in){.        rate = in.nextint();.        return rate;.    }.}"
