"what is the simpledateformat pattern that parses like the deprecated string constructor for date? i have some code that looks like ""sat may 12 04:46:05 edt 2012"" that is currently being parsed by the blank.util.date's date(string s) constructor. however, now i am getting a warning in my ide since it says that it is deprecated and the blankdoc says:...  deprecated. as of jdk version 1.1, replaced by dateformat.parse(string s)....i tried using the simpledateformatter but the default formatter is causing an exception, so i want to try using a pattern, but what is the pattern to parse like the string constructor does?....nb: this is different from other similar questions because it is specifically asking about replacing a deprecated (and popular) constructor, not just asking for help parsing an arbitrary date string."
