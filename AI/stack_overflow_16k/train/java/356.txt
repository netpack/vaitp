"run external program concurrently and communicate with it through stdin / stdout i want to be able to run an external program concurrently with my blank code, i.e. i want to start the program, then return control to the calling method while keeping the external program running at the same time. the blank code will then keep generating input and send it to the external program and receive output back.  ..i don't want to keep loading the external program as it has very high overhead.  what is the best way to accomplish this?  thanks!"
