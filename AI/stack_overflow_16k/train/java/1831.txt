are anonymous classes a bad idea? after using them a while i can't help but feel that the hoops you're forced to jump through when using anonymous classes are not worth it...you end up with final all over the place and no matter what the code is more difficult to read than if you'd used a well named inner class...so what are the advantages of using them?  i must be missing something.
