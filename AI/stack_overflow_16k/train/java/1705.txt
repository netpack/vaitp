jdk 8 to jdk 7 on mac osx i was earlier using jdk 8 but now for a project i require jdk 7. i have a mac so how do i change my jdk from 8 to 7. .i can see all the jdk installed on my mac from library-->blank-->blank virtual machines..also i have tried going to system preferences-->blank control pannel-->blank . this only shows the jre does not show jdk's installed on mac so i cannot change that from here...thanks
