"blank - how to manipulate time for testing? i'm working with blank and jsp. i have to create something like a promotion which has start date and end date. within the start date and end date, it will show a form that is corresponding to the promotion; otherwise, it will be just show a normal page. i have done the validation based on the time they open the page. i can manipulate the time in unit testing by making the current time to any time i want. ..however, the problem is when i want to pass this to client to test. they want to see how it's like on the promotion day? does the promotion really show on a particular time? does it really close afterwards? one possible way is to secretly pass current date as http param when trying to access the page. doing so, client can check how the system behaves on a particular day but it's very dangerous indeed. anyone who knows this will be able to access the promotion anytime they want. i don't know what the best way to handle this...what's your suggestion?"
