"connecting to a url in blank through a proxy i'm trying to write a small blank program that connects to a twitter search url (which returns a json list of tweets) using the url connection libary.  ..my code which is taken from the blank tutorials looks like :..        public static void main(string[] args) throws exception {.        url oracle = new url(""http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=hi"");.        urlconnection yc = oracle.openconnection();.        bufferedreader in = new bufferedreader(.                                new inputstreamreader(.                                yc.getinputstream()));.        string inputline;..        while ((inputline = in.readline()) != null) .            system.out.println(inputline);.        in.close();.    }...but for some reason i keep getting the following exception:..in thread ""main"" blank.net.connectexception: connection refused.    at blank.net.plainsocketimpl.socketconnect(native method)...i don't know if this is something due to the way i've written the code, and eclipse setting or something to do with my network. i do have a proxy server configured for internet access. as far as i know this is properly configured because i am getting updates and can install new software through eclipse. do i need to put the proxy information in the url method somehow or is something else the problem."
