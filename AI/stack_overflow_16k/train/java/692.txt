use a public static method to initialize another object's field i have a class as follows:..public class myclass {.   ....   string lang = config.getlang();.   ....}...config.getlang() is a public static method in class named config. my question is: does this initialization have any implication or problem?..string lang = config.getlang();...eclipse does not report any compilation problem.
