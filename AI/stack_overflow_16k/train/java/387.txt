"simple yet in depth explanation of this code i am just a beginner to programming, and blank. as i have very, very little experience with blank, i would like a simple, yet in depth explanation of this code. this code uses two classes and many methods. ..class apples:..package jacob;.import blank.util.scanner;..class apples {.public static void main (string args[]){.    scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.    grapes gobject = new grapes();..    system.out.println(""enter name of first gf here: "");.    string temp = input.nextline();.    gobject.setname(temp);.    gobject.saying();....}.}...class grapes: ..package jacob;.public class grapes {.private string girlname;.public void setname(string name){.    girlname=name;.}.public string getname(){.    return girlname;.}.public void saying(){.    system.out.printf(""your first gf was %s"", getname());.}.}...i get confused when i get to these two parts: ..gobject.setname(temp);.    gobject.saying();...and..private string girlname;.public void setname(string name){.    girlname=name;.}.public string getname(){.    return girlname;.}.public void saying(){.    system.out.printf(""your first gf was %s"", getname());...why would one go through so much trouble when they could have done: ..package jacob;.import blank.util.scanner;.public class test {.public static void main (string args[]){.    scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.println(""enter name of first gf here: "");.    string gfname = input.nextline();.    system.out.println(""the name of your first gf is "" + gfname + ""."");.}.}...please note that the original code is from thenewboston and is not mine. the second bit of code is what i have created."
