"why i can use set to change private member,but can't use = here i have some doubts about why we can use setter to change a private member but can't use ""="" to change it..for example..public class student {.    private date date;.    private integer age;.    public integer getage() {.        return age;.    }.    public void setage(integer age) {.        this.age = age;.    }.    public date getdate() {.        return date;.    }.    public void setdate(date date) {.        this.date = date;.    }.}..public class hellotest {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        student student = new student();.        student.getdate().settime(1000);.        //student.getage()=100;  not allowed.    }.}...i don't know why i can use '.settime(1000)' to change date, but can't use '=100' to change age..in my mind, both getdate and getage get the object reference..thanks."
