"why am i getting this warning about utility classes in blank i'm learning blank and oops and while programming a basic hello world in eclipse, i see a yellow triangle telling me 'utility classes should not have a public or default constructor'. i'm not able to understand why exactly is this happening and what does it mean? what am i doing not right?..class helloworld {...public static void main(string[] args).{.    // todo auto-generated method stub.            system.out.println(""hola mundo!"");..}...  }...edit1: edited the code to include changes suggested...final class helloworld {...private helloworld().{.    throw new assertionerror(""instantiating utility class..."");..}.public static void main(string[] args).{.    // todo auto-generated method stub.            system.out.println(""hola mundo!"");..}...}...still getting the alert on the line class helloworld...edit2:..created a new class and now it works. thanks jon.why does the old class still give warning? bohemian i'm still not aware about the concepts mentioned by you in your post.  i would come back to them once i get a better idea. thank you for explaining things."
