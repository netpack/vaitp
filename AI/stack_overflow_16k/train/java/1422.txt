"blank program is not giving the required output the question is to print the following series:  ..(a+(2^0)*b), ((a+(2^0)*b)+(a+(2^1)*b)), ((a+(2^0)*b)+(a+(2^1)*b)+(a+(2^2)*b)...+(a+(2^(n-1))*b))...the values of a,b,n and t are enterred by the user. 't' denotes the number of series that the user wants to calculate. for eg, if t=2, then the user can give two separate inputs of a,b and n and obtain two different series.  ..if t=2  .a=0,b=2,n=10...and for second series-  ..a=5,b=3,n=5...output should be:  ..2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046  (1st series)  .8 14 26 50 98                       (2nd series) ...the program below is not showing the required output. can someone please point out the mistakes?..import blank.io.*;  ..class solution{  ..    public static void main(string []argh){  ..        scanner in = new scanner(system.in);  ..        int t=in.nextint();  ..        int s=0;  ..        for(int i=0;i&lt;t;i++){  ..            int  a  =  in.nextint();    ..            int  b  =  in.nextint(); ..            int n = in.nextint();..            for(int j=0;j&lt;n;j++)  .            {  .                s = s+(a+(2^j)*b);  .                system.out.print(s+"" "");  .            }  .        }  .        in.close();  .    }  ..}"
