"does blank have an equivalent of a pump pattern to handle slow clients? at the moment we have an architecture where a server streams data to the client.  we're finding instances where the client cannot process data quickly enough, the buffer overflows and the client is disconnected. node.js has a pump pattern whereby a stream can be paused if data is not fully flushed and then resumed once the stream is drained. how would i do the equivalent pause/resume cycle in blank?"
