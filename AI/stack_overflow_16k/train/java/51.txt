"how to change the input from a string to a scanner input and then use it in my code for my final project, i am attempting to change the input in the tester class from a string to a scanner input..here is the original line of code:..public class financialcalculatortester.{.    public static void main(string[] args).   {.       financialcalculator.showcustomerinfo(""antonio williams"");.   }.}...the output comes to this: ...  name: antonio williamsage: 40  phone: (225)897-7865 salary: 85043.0 insurance: 2084.0.  monthly expenses: 10000.0.  savings: 72959.0...(the information comes from the other class with all the information)..i would like to change it to something along the lines of:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class financialcalculatortester {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        system.out.println(""enter name: "");.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);           .        financialcalculator.showcustomerinfo();.     }. }...i want to do this because there is more than one name in the array list and i want the user to choose what name they want. .if needed, i can show the code for the other class. ..i want to choose a name from the other class and get an output of that names information (such as the original output seen above.) each name has their own output such as that one. .thank you!"
