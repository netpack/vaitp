"what does ceill floor in this code mean? can anybody explain me what does this code mean? in if/else. i have read documentation several times, but can't get what does these functions mean. thanks...private long getbalancewithfactor(long balance, double factor) {.        double faccountbalance = (double)balance * factor;.        long res = 0;.        if ((math.ceil(faccountbalance) - faccountbalance) &lt;= 0.5).            res = (long)math.ceil(faccountbalance);.        else.            res = (long)math.floor(faccountbalance);.        return res;.    }"
