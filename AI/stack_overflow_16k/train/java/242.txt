"program figuring out if a number entered is even i need to make it so the computer figures out whether an int somebody entered is even or not. how would i prove that? i tied just dividing it by two, but that isn't a boolean, and i don't know how i would figure it out with booleans either. also would i need a separate counter to count the evens?..import blank.util.scanner; .public class evennumber {. public static void main(string[] args) {. scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);. int numberone = 0; .  for(int counter = 0; counter &lt; 15; counter++).   system.out.print(""enter a number: "");.   numberone = scan.nextint(); .  if(numberone/2  ){..  }. }.}"
