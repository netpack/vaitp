compare arraylists of chars alphabetically i've got my own class word and symbol. symbol is some wrapper for char. word is an  arraylist&lt;symbol&gt;..i need to sort arraylist&lt;word&gt; by number of occurrences of some symbol or if number of occurrence is the same - alphabetically. .how to do it? i think i need to override compareto method of class word and then use collections.sort. .but i don't know how to compare two words(two arraylists) alphabetically. ..here is part of symbol class..public class symbol implements comparable&lt;symbol&gt; {.    private char symbol;.    ......    @override.    public int compareto(symbol o) {.        return character.valueof(symbol).compareto(character.valueof(o.getsymbol()));.    }.}...and here is the part of word class..public class word implements comparable&lt;word&gt; {..    private arraylist&lt;symbol&gt; word;.    private symbol comparable_symbol;..    public int count(){ //number of occurrences.        int count = 0;.        for(symbol s:word){.            if (s == comparable_symbol) count++;.        }.        return count;.    }..    @override.    public int compareto(word o) {.        int left = this.count();.        int right = o.count();.        if (left == right){.            //compare alphabetically.        }.        else return (left &gt; right)?1:-1;.    }..}...how to compare two arraylists alphabetically?
