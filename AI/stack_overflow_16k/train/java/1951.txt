"check if string contains number whilst ignoring punctuation - blank i need to read a string and then change all the numbers (from 0 - 12, inclusive) to the word for that number i.e. one, two,...twelve...for example:.this costs 1 dollar, but this is 12...would be modified to:.this costs one dollar, but this is twelve...i tried this code..        string[] line = s.split("" "");.        stringbuilder stringbuilder = new stringbuilder();.        for (string word : line){.            try {.                int i = integer.parseint(word);.                if (map.containskey(i)){.                    stringbuilder.append(map.get(i));.                } else.                    stringbuilder.append(i);.            } catch (exception e) {.                stringbuilder.append(word);.            } finally {.                stringbuilder.append("" "");.            }.        }.        stringbuilder.deletecharat(stringbuilder.length()-1);            ...(the map just contains numbers 0-12 and their word equivalents)..the output was: this costs one dollar, but this is 12...obviously, the full-stop is the problem here; is there anyway i can ignore the punctuation?"
