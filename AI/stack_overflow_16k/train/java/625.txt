"only one word of a sentence prints using replace method as my class project i have written some codes that receives a sentence and if it has a special character by checking it's ascii code it replaces it with another one. but unfortunately every time it replaces and shows only first word and deletes rest of the sentence. please help me and if there's a better way for this it's appreciated...here's my code:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class helloworld {..public static void main(string[] arg) {.    scanner scanner = new scanner(system.in);.    string s = scanner.next();.    if (s.contains(""u0626"")) {.        string result = s.replaceall(""u0626"", ""u0628"");.        system.out.println(result);.    }...}...}"
