"perspectivetranform blankfx code fails to compile? add(node) error i've been working on a project involving perspectivetransform in the blankfx library (on blank, of course), but my ide keeps giving me this error at the .add part:..the method add(node) in the type list&lt;node&gt; is not applicable for the arguments (rectangle)...below is the code i'm using:..    perspectivetransform pt = new perspectivetransform(20,0,400,0,0,600,300,600);.    group gr = new group();.    gr.seteffect(pt);.    gr.setcache(true);..    rectangle rect = new rectangle(300,250);.    gr.getchildren().add(rect);...i'm pretty sure i'm doing everything right, what could be the issue here? i'm using eclipse is that means anything, on ubuntu 12.04 lts"
