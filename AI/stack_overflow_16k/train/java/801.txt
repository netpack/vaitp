"blank - object properties does not differ classname ref = new classname();.ref.setcredentials(credentials);.ref.setval(value);.ref.setuser(user);...now when i create a new object of the same class reference, i still get the previous values i have set. why is this so?..classname ref2 = new classname();.ref2.setval(value);.ref2.setuser(user);.ref2.setsomethingnew(somethingnew);...my ref and ref2 instances have all the values [credentials, value, user and somethingnew]. i want to differentiate these two instances. is it because it's holding the same object?..update my lapse:..it's actually ref2 and not ref. i get the values in ref2 which i am not setting, and ref too holds a value which i am setting in the instance of ref2. both are in same context."
