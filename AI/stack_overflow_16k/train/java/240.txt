"writing a method to find prime numbers i'm trying to write a program that uses a predicate method that finds all the prime numbers between 1-100. i know there are more efficient ways of finding prime numbers but right now but i want to use the brute-force strategy and try every possible combination.  right now the program as it is, just prints true or false 10,000 times  but i want my program to only print the numbers if they are prime. so after the program is done i'll have a list of prime numbers between 1- 100.  1. is my program correct for what i'm trying to do? 2. what would be good suggesting to change my program so that it lists all the prime numbers between 1-100...import acm.program.*;.public class primenumbers extends consoleprogram{.public void run(){..    for (int i =1; i &lt;= 100, i++){.        for (int j =1; j&lt;= 100; j++){.           println(yesprime(i, j));.       }.     }.   }..private boolean yesprime (int n, int k){.      return ( n % k == 0)..       }.    }.  }"
