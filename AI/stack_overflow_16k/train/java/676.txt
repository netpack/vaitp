"blank game - how does it work? (i'm new to blank (or programming in general) and am trying to figure out how this game works..i know that the game field is divided in 3 areas: color picker area, score area and the draw area. but which variable determine which ranges in which way?. - what are the relative and absolute size components of the color picker area and game control area? what does it do?. - why did the programmer divided the tile_size just to multiply it again?. - how and for what do they initialize the 2d array mytiles in public static void initcolorgame() method?)"
