"alternative(?) blank solution | arraylist i am writing a blank code that should remove all the ""0"" in an arraylist and return a new list, identical, but without the ""0""...for an example:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    int[] sound = {0, 0 , 0, 0, -14, 120, 67, -234, -15, -389, 289, 178, -437, 33, 15, 0, 0, -32, 230, 368};.    int[] result = trimsilencefromfront(sound);.    system.out.println(arrays.tostring(result));.}...should be:..[-14, 120, 67, -234, -15, -389, 289, 178, -437, 33, 15, 0, 0, -32, 230, 368]...i did this code:..import blank.util.*;..public class nozero {.    public static int[] trimsilencefromfront(int[] samples) {.        int[] newarraylist = new int[samples.length];..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; samples.length; i = i + 1) {.            if (samples[i] != 0) {.                newarraylist.add(samples);.            }.        }.        return newarraylist;   .    }.}...when i looked at the answer they had while loops mixed with for loops. but since there is more than one way to solve this: is my code wrong?..update: i misunderstood the question. i thought it should remove all the ""0"". but as you can see on the result it should only remove the silence at the start...thank you all!"
