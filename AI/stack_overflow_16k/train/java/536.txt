"blank seperate class method not incrementing a variable in my main class method so this is the main code for my text-based game...import blank.util.scanner;..public class d_m_rpg {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        //creating the class to call on my toolbox.        d_m_rpgtoolbox toolbox = new d_m_rpgtoolbox();..        //creating the scanner class for user input.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        //initiating variables and final variables aswell as arrays.        //token variable to validate open spots in an array.        int slotcounter = 0;.        int inventoryexpander = 11;..        //first initiated will be the character creation variables.        string haircolor = """";.        string eyecolor = """";.        string skincolor = """";.        string gender = """";..        //initiating the arrays for character inventory slots.        string[] weaponslots = new string[10];..        //initiating the arrays for the character creation.        string[] haircolorarr = {""black"",""green"",""yellow"",""brown"",""blue"",""blonde"",""grey"",""white""};.        string[] eyecolorarr = {""green"",""brown"",""blue"",""grey"",};.        string[] skincolorarr = {""white"",""brown"",""black"",};.        string[] genderarr = {""male"",""female""};..        //creating the introduction title and introduction.        system.out.println(""welcome to, cold omen."");.        system.out.println(""nnovember 12th, 2150: ontario, canada"");.        system.out.println(""nyou hear loud shouts and gun fire all around you but can't pinpoint the location of anything, you feel a bit dazed until someone grabs you and you open your eyes and snap out of it."");.        system.out.println(""nunknown: 'get up, its time to move out. take this.'"");.        system.out.println(""nunknown hands you a 'm4-a4 rifle'"");.        system.out.println(""nyou manage to catch a small glimpse of him before you get up."");..        //character creation screen.        system.out.println();..        //only works once wont incremement the slotcounter.        toolbox.insert(weaponslots, slotcounter, inventoryexpander, ""m4-a4 rifle"");.        system.out.println(""n"" + weaponslots[0]);.        toolbox.insert(weaponslots, slotcounter, inventoryexpander, ""ak47"");.        system.out.println(weaponslots[0]);.    }.}...so i have this method i made to basically add an ""item"" to the weaponslots array (the inventory) but whenever i run it it will add to the first element in the array [0] but it wont incremement the slotcounter which should go up by one every time the method is used so that i dont replace any items in the array it should just add items until its full which is checked using the inventoryexpander variable. at the moment i have it printing the element at 0 and 0 for the array but i have checked 1 aswell and 1 is just null no item added it only just replaces the element at 0. heres the code for the method to increment etc: ..public class d_m_rpgtoolbox {..    //method for random number generating to be used for crit hits, turns, loot generation etc.    public int randomgen(){.        int x = (int) (math.random()*((20-0)+1)+0);.        return x;.    }..    //method for inserting into an array only works once wont incremement the slotcounter fix .    public void insert(string[] a, int b, int d , string c) {.        if(b &lt; d) {.            a[b] = c;.            b++;.        }//end of if statement.    }//end of method.}"
