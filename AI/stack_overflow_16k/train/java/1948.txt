"how can i extend reflectiontostringbuilder to avoid duplication? the canonical use for reflectiontostringbuilder is as follows..public string tostring() {.     return (new reflectiontostringbuilder(this) {.         protected boolean accept(field f) {.             return super.accept(f) &amp;&amp; !f.getname().equals(""password"");.         }.     }).tostring();. }...is it possible to somehow not repeat this if it has to be done multiple times. i really think so but maybe someone more advanced than me might have a suggestion. what i really want to do is actually add a method."
