"how to pass variables from blank to shell commands i am using process builder to execute multiple shell commands (not external shell script) from blank. i can pass system environment variables to the shell command; however, if i want to pass on a variable defined in blank (for example a string) as a argument to the shell command, how can i do that? my code looks something like this. i want two files to be created (touched) by name 123 &amp; 234...public class execshellcmds {..public static void beginwrite() {.    string var1 = ""123"";.    string var2 = ""234"";..    string s = null;.    try {.        string[] cmd = {""/bin/bash"", ""-c"",.            ""touch var1;"".            + ""touch var2;"".        };..        process p = runtime.getruntime().exec(cmd);.}}"
