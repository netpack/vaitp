"how do i parse a blank file to retrieve its function names? i am working on a small program to compare two blank files. my goal is to compare the two files so that i can see what functions were added and deleted from one file to another (like a simple version control program). i am running into issues on how i should be handling these files. my current approach is to use a scanner and use:..        while(scanner.hasnext()) {.            string function = scanner.next(""((public|private|protected|static|final|native|synchronized|abstract|threadsafe|transient)+\s)+[\$_\w\&lt;\&gt;\[\]]*\s+[\$_\w]+\([^\)]*\)?\s*\{?[^\}]*\}?"");.            system.out.println(function);       .    }...however this is not getting me any results for a file that i know has functions in it. any tips or ideas on how to approach this?"
