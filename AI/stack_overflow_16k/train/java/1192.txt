"blank comparator warning i am using comparator to compare files by size, but when i tried to compile my code i got warning: ""blank uses unchecked or unsafe operations"". i put my code into comments and than the program worked, so i think is the problem with sorting in comparator class. here is my code:  ..public class size implements comparator {..    @override.    public int compare(object o1, object o2) {..        long s1 = ((class)o1).getsize();.        long s2 = ((class)o2).getsize();..        if (s1 &gt; s2){.            return 1;.        }.        else if (s1 &lt; s2){.            return -1;.        }.        else {.            return 0;.        }.    }.}"
