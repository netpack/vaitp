"blank logic issue in askquestion() method i'm trying to create a blank math training program. i have a working version in blankscript and some of you guys have already helped me convert it over to blank. it's supposed to ask the user a difficulty (which then uses that amount of digits for each number in the questions). it then asks the user what type of math to do (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, random). it then asks the user 10 questions. as the user answers, it tells them if they're right or wrong. if wrong, they get to continue attempting the question. at the end of 10 questions, it calculates if you got over 75% of them right and displays an appropriate response. full instructions:....i finally got most of it working correctly, only to find out that the math itself is wrong..sometimes if i enter a difficulty of 2, it only gives 1 digit (it basically doesn't calculate the difficulty right). also, it always tells me my math is wrong. is there any chance you guys can spot anything wrong with the logic?..thanks for any help...import blank.util.*;.import blankx.swing.joptionpane;..public class assignment2 {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        // todo auto-generated method stub.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.        int difficulty = 1;.        string[] operators = {""plus"", ""minus"", ""times"", ""divided by""};.        int selectedoperator = 1;.        int correctanswers = 0;.        int answeredtyped = 0;..        int difficultyinput = integer.parseint(.            joptionpane.showinputdialog(.
