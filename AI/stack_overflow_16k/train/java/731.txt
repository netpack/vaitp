"character streams often “wrappers” for byte streams while going through character stream information in blank io stream, i found following lines hard to understand: ..character streams often “wrappers” for byte streams. the character stream uses the byte stream to perform the physical i/o, while the character stream handles translation between characters and bytes. filereader, for example, uses fileinputstream, while filewriter uses fileoutputstream...would someone help me to understand... thank you"
