finding the name of the object that a specific value belongs to i am creating a bank application in blank but i am having some troubles with the way that the accounts are created/work. ..i have created quite a lot of back-end for my application and am now working on the front-end using blankfx. the issue i am having is with my login screen and how i can see if the username entered matches up with the password that the user has given on signup...all usernames are currently stored in a string[] called 'usernames' and this is what i am using to check if the username exists...how do i match a password up with the username value and see if it is the same as what the user entered?..for (int i = 0; i &lt; usernamescurrent.length; i++) {.    if (usernamescurrent[i] == usernametext.gettext() &amp;&amp; /*this is what i am having problems with*/) {..    }.}
