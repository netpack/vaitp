"blank - dividing two integers gives 0? i might be missing something simple here, but when i divide two numbers that definately should not equal 0, i'm getting 0...i've tried forcefully casting the values. songduration, originalsongduration are integers. i need the percentage to be a float...system.out.print(""songduration: "" + songduration + "" :: originalsongduration: "" + originalsongduration + "" :: percentage: "" + (float) ((int)songduration / (int)originalsongduration));..[17:43:03 info]: songduration: 64746 :: originalsongduration: 140746 :: percentage: 0.0...thanks."
