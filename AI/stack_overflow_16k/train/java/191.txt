"why does the number not show up correctly when i run the program? you’re going to automate the famous song “99 bottles of xxx on the wall”..you will print the lyrics of all 99 verses of the song.  use a loop!  if.you don’t know the lyrics, look them up with google...the program should:...ask the user for their age.if the user is 21 or older, ask them if they prefer beer or soda...a.       if they are under 21  or they prefer soda, then the lyrics are “99.bottles of soda on the wall”..b.      if they are over 21, then it is “99 bottles of beer”..you must use a while loop and the counter variable must be part of the.print statement!..so the first verse would be:..99 bottles of soda on the wall..99 bottles of soda..if one of those bottles should fall off the wall..…..98 bottles of soda on the wall..the last verse:..1 bottle of soda on the wall..1 bottle of soda..if that lone bottle of soda should fall off the wall..no bottles of soda on the wall!..so think, what do you need to add to your loop to print the last verse with.the slightly different lyrics?..// here is my code. when i run it the last lyrics show up like this..1 of beer on the wall. 1 bottles of beer. if one of those bottles should fall off the wall. ...0 bottles of beer on the wall. 0 of beer on the wall. 0 bottles of beer. if that lone bottle of beer should fall off the wall. no bottles of beer on the wall...// how can i  make ""0"" bottle part not to show up??..scanner user = new scanner(system.in);..           int age, beverage;...           system.out.println(""please type in your age"");.           age = user.nextint();..           user.nextline();.           system.out.println(""would you like soda or beer? soda=1 beer=2"");.           beverage = user.nextint();..        if(age&lt;21 || beverage==1).           {.           int bottles = 99;.            while( 1&lt;= bottles){.                system.out.println(bottles+"" of soda on the wall"");.                system.out.println(bottles+"" bottles of soda"");.                system.out.println(""if one of those bottles should fall off the wall"");.                bottles--;.                system.out.println(""...""+bottles+"" bottles of soda on the wall"");.            if(bottles==0){.                system.out.println(bottles+"" of soda on the wall"");.                system.out.println(bottles+"" bottles of soda"");.                system.out.println(""if that lone bottle of soda should fall off the wall"");.                system.out.println(""no bottles of soda on the wall"");.            }.        }.    }.        if(age&gt;=21 &amp;&amp; beverage == 2).        {.            int bottles=99;.            while(1&lt;= bottles){.                system.out.println(bottles+"" of beer on the wall"");.                system.out.println(bottles+"" bottles of beer"");.                system.out.println(""if one of those bottles should fall off the wall"");.                bottles--;.                system.out.println(""...""+bottles+"" bottles of beer on the wall"");.            if(bottles==0){.                system.out.println(bottles+"" of beer on the wall"");.                system.out.println(bottles+"" bottles of beer"");.                system.out.println(""if that lone bottle of beer should fall off the wall"");.                system.out.println(""no bottles of beer on the wall"");.            }.        }.    }..        }.    }"
