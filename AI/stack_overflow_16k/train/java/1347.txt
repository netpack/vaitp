"how to add elements to a linkedlist that is contained within a hashmap? i create an adjacency list of vertices using a hashmap where 'v' is the total amount of vertices to be created and 'v' is the individual vertex. 'v' represents both a key for hashmap adj and the name of that vertex. each key 'v' points to an initially empty linkedlist. i need to access that linkedlist to:.1. add elements to the linkedlist.2. iterate through the linkedlist 1 element at a time to be implemented within a for-each loop...hashmap&lt;integer, list&lt;integer&gt;&gt;adj = new hashmap&lt;integer, list&lt;integer&gt;&gt;();.    for(int v = 0; v &lt; v; v++).        adj.put(v, new linkedlist&lt;integer&gt;());...1. intended function: add int w to end of linkedlist at key 'v'..((linkedlist&lt;integer&gt;)adj.get(v)).addlast(w);...2. intended function: for each node in linkedlist at key 'v', add that node to key'w' and perform the specified function at each iteration.   ..for(int w : ((linkedlist&lt;integer&gt;)adj.get(v).listiterator(0))).    //do this...any suggestions for better implementation or possible improvements greatly appreciated."
