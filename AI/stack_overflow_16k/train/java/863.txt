"calculate upper bound based on a max values from a list i have a list of transactions, integer. i need to create range to display that list in a bar chart. i am trying to compute upper bound of that range based on the maximum value from the list..eg: if the list is {8, 9 , 91, 45}, then .1. calculate max as 91..2. calculate range, lower bound always 0 but upper bound  can be 100...any ideas how to do that?"
