"blank strings dont work right anymore okay so i'm learning blank and everything was working fine yesterday, and all of the sudden today all of the stuff i wrote (just some super basic stuff) no longer work, for example..package sectionone;..public class addingnumbers {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        // todo auto-generated method stub..        int x = 10;.        int y = 20;.        int result = x+y;.        system.out.println(result);..    }..}...gives me error:...  error: main method not found in class sectionone.addingnumbers, please define the main method as:.     public static void main(string[] args).  or a blankfx application class must extend blankfx.application.application...unless i change this:..public static void main(string[] args) {...to this:..public static void main(blank.lang.string[] args) {...the program won't work. also when i create a string like..string x = ""test"";...it won't work unless i do..blank.lang.string x = ""test"";...what's going on?"
