"blank- have to model a circle okay so i don't know if any of you like helping homework at all, but i've gotten nowhere on this last part of a homework assignment. here's my code:..import blank.awt.graphics;.import blank.awt.point;..public class circle {.    private point center;.    private double radius;..    public circle() {.        radius = 0;.        center = new point(0, 0);.    }..    public circle(point c, double r) {.        radius = r;.        center = c;.    }..    public point getcenter() {.        return center;.    }..    public double getradius() {.        return radius;.    }..    public void setcenter(point newcenter) {.        center = newcenter;.    }..    public void setradius(double newradius) {.        radius = newradius;.    }..    public void drawcircle(graphics g) {..    }..    public boolean dotheyintersect(circle other) {..    }.}...okay so basically my teacher will use a program that makes circles on a drawing panel. he will use this to do that and then define where the circles are supposed to be. he required 6 specific methods on top of the constructors/fields. as you can see, i have done everything but the last 2 methods, one being a void and one a boolean...the first one is supposed to enable graphics from blank.awt, and the 2nd method is to check if they intersect. i literally think its one or 2 lines of code in each method i have not completed. the problem is that this is not an answer i can build towards, rather an answer i just have to try until i get it right, and i am lost right now. so any pointers would be awesome. so anyways, in the ""drawcircle"" and the ""dotheyintersect"" methods, i just need to know what will make them work. i literally just have to enable graphics in the first one, and then test the circles to see if they have a connecting point in the 2nd method. tell me i'm a cheater or moocher all you want, but i'm lost."
