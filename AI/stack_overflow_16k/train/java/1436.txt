"how to enable fqn class collision checking in blank 8? i spent too much time hunting a problem that turned out to be caused by a class name collision...is there a way to check if given classpath contains identically named classes?..e.g. if i suspect that class name is duplicated, can i tell blank to check that before running the app? or, perhaps, there is a utility i can run from command line to check for the same?"
