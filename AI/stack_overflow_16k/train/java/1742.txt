"portable way of finding total disk size in blank (pre blank 6) i need to find the total size of a drive in blank 5 (or 1.5, whatever). i know that blank 6 has a new method in blank.io.file, but i need it to work in blank 5...apache commons io has org.apache.commons.io.filesystemutils to provide the free disk space, but not the total disk space...i realize this is os dependant and will need to depend on messy command line invocation. i'm fine with it working on ""most"" systems, i.e. windows/linux/macosx. preferably i'd like to use an existing library rather than write my own variants...any thoughts? thanks."
