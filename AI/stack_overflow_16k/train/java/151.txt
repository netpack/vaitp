"how to scan until the the next line is equal to 0 in blank? i'm trying to make a program that takes a k number of coordinates and for each coordinate print ""x = ___, y = ____"". so this means that the output has k lines of such format. ..the program should stop when it reaches a line containing only the number ""0"", which is what i am struggling to implement. this is my code: ..    public static void main (string [] args){..    scanner scanner = new scanner (system.in);.    string kstring = scanner.next();.    if (!kstring.equals(""0"")){..        int k = integer.parseint(kstring);.            int [] xcords = new int [k];.            int [] ycords = new int [k];.            for (int i=0; i&lt;k; i++){.                xcords[i] = scanner.nextint();.                ycords[i] = scanner.nextint();.                system.out.println (""x = ""+xcords[i]+"", y = ""+ycords[i]);.            }..    }else{.        system.exit(1);.    }..}...if my first line is just the number 0, the program stops running...if it's another number, it effectively lets me scan k number of coordinates, but it has a weird behavior from the second k value and so on. ..if i try to stop it inputing a line equal to 0 (not as the first line), it won't stop. ..any clue of what's wrong?"
