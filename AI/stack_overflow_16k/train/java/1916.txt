creating a deque class methods i need to write my own deque class and must used a doublylinked list implementation to store data. the problem is writing the method pushfromleft(thing thing) which will insert into the left side of the deque. below is what i have thus far but does not seem to work. .. public void pushleft(thing thing) {.         node beg = new node();  .         node end = new node();.         node t = new node();  ..       if(isempty()).       { .             beg = first;.             end = last;.             beg = end;.             t = beg.thing;.             n++;.       }.       else.       {.             beg = beg.next;.             end = end.next;.             t = beg.previous;.             n++;...       }
