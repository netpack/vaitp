"non-void method invoking without assigning return value i tend to think that most of the time that variable returning methods are invoked to assign the return value to a variable, e.g.:..return1 = object.dosomething();...nevertheless, apart from executing the method: what happens when a returning method is invoked and the return value is not assigned to a variable? e.g:..object.dosomething();...is this a good practice? where does the return goes? ..jb nizet made a remarkable comment stating that methods are implemented for most cases. kind of explains why this situation occurs often."
