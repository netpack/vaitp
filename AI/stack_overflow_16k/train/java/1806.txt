"how to read a file character by character until a specific string is complete? i'm struggling with this concept for a problem i have. i wrote a compression algorithm that compresses text files based on a list of character to code pairs that are stored in objects within an array. now when decompressing i've realized i have to read each the file character by character until a string is created that matches one of the codes, write the character that that code corresponds to, and keep iterating over the file until it's finished...i'm not too certain where to go from here, but here is what i have so far:.. compressedfile compfile = new compressedfile(args[0],""read"");.    textfile outfile = new textfile(args[0].substring(0,args[0].lastindexof('.') )+"".dec"",""write"");..    string output = """";.    string temp = """";.    char charac = 0;.    check = false;..    while(!check) {.    charac =compfile.readbit();.    if(charac==(char)0) {.        throw new nullpointerexception();.    }.    temp=compressioncodes.getcharacter((compressioncodes.findcode(charac)));...there's a lot more that's missing but it shouldn't really be important, it's just this loop that i'm really struggling with."
