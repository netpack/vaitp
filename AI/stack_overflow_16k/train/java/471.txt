"missing return statement error basic program im writing a small program for a class at school and have run into the ""missing return statement error."" ive tried googling the error to see if i can find a generic answer that might help me but nothing ive done to my code has been able to get rid of this error so that my program can compile. for reference, here is the assignment for the program i am trying to write:..you have been commissioned by the us navy to develop a system for tracking the amount of fuel consumed by fleets of ships. each ship has a name (ex: ""uss montana""), fuel capacity (the maximum amount of fuel the ship can carry), and amount of fuel currently onboard. in this problem, fuel is measured in ""units"" and the capacity of each ship is an integer number (ex: the carrier's capacity is 125 fuel units). each fleet has exactly four ships in it. when a fleet is deployed, each ship in the fleet is deployed. when a ship is deployed, it consumes half of the fuel it has onboard. when a fleet is refueled, each ship in the fleet is refueled. when a ship is refueled, it is totally filled up (its onboard amount equals its capacity)..and here is my code:../**. * navy ship descriptions. * . * @author elizabeth rehbein. * @version 01/28/16. */.public class ship.{..    // instance variables .    private string name;        //ship name.    private double fuelcapacity;       //ship fuel capacity.    private double fuelcurrent;  //the ship's current fuel on ship after deployments.    private double fuelconsumed;   //the amount of fuel a ship has consumed after deployments...    //constructor.    public ship(string startname, double startfuelcapacity, double startfuelcurrent, double startfuelconsumed).    {.        // initialise instance variables.        name=startname;.        fuelcapacity=startfuelcapacity;.        fuelcurrent=startfuelcurrent;.        fuelconsumed=startfuelconsumed;.    }..   //get methods.    public string getname().    {.        return name;

    //reduces ships current fuel by half with every depolyment.        fuelconsumed += fuelcapacity/2;  //adds the fuel used in depolyment to fuelconsumed to track total fuel used.    }..    public double refuel().    //refueling each ship returns it to its full fuel capacity.    {.        fuelcurrent = fuelcapacity;.    }   .}...../**. * a fleet of navy ships.. * . * @author elizabeth rehbein . * @version 02/05/16. */.public class fleet.{.    // instance variables .    private ship ship1;
