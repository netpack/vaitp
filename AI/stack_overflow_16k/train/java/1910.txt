"computer not reading last number from a text file for my  assignment i was to make a program that would read and print the numbers from a text file, then calculate the sum and the average of those numbers. my program does that just fine. the only problem i have is that the program will not read the last number from my text file. the numbers on the file read:..3.8.1.13.18.15.7.17.1.14.0.12.3.2.5 .4 ...for some reason the computer will not read the number 4. ..here is my program:..{ //begin testshell .public static void main (string[] args).{ //begin main.    system.out.println(""scores"");.    scanner infile=null;.    try.    {.        infile = new scanner(new file(""ints.dat""));.    }.    catch (filenotfoundexception e) .        {.        system.out.println (""file not found!"");.        // stop program if no file found.        system.exit (0);.        }..   // sets sum at 0 so numbers will be added.   int sum=0;..   int num= infile.nextint();..   // starts counting the amount of numbers so average can be calculated.   int numberamount=0;..    while(infile.hasnext()) .    {       .        // print the integer.        system.out.println(num);..        // adds the number to 0 and stores the new number into the variable sum.        sum = num+sum;..        // increases the number of numbers .        numberamount++;.        // reads the next integer.        num = infile.nextint();.    }.    infile.close();.    // calculates average.    double average = (double)sum/(double)numberamount;.    average = math.round (average * 100.0) / 100.0;  ..    //output.    system.out.println(""the sum of the numbers = ""+sum);.    system.out.println(""the number of scores = ""+numberamount);.    system.out.println(""the average of the numbers = ""+average);..    }//end main.}//end testshell"
