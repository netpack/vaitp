loading an image saved in a package in a jframe i have looked through and none of the other answers on this site have worked for me. i need to load some pictures from another package in a jframe. all the jframe is for is to contain that image. this is my layout right now: blankproject/src/basic/main.blank.for my images they are saved in here:.blankproject/src/image/thing.jpg..i have an array setup for multiple images. so i want this jframe to display the image[0] so it has to open and load the jframe with src/image/thing0.jpeg
