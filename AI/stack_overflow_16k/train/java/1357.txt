"positive powers of k in long data type i have to print all the positive powers of integer k in the blank long data type..my code is:..int k = integer.parseint(args[0]);.    int i = 1;.    long a = k;.    while (a &lt;= long.max_value) {.        system.out.print(i + "" "");.        system.out.println(a);.        i++;.        a = (long) math.pow(k, i);.      }...an infinite loop is created when i run this program...but,when i run this program with a small change :(i have just removed the equals to operator in while condition)..int k = integer.parseint(args[0]);.    int i = 1;.    long a = k;.    while (a &lt; long.max_value) {.        system.out.print(i + "" "");.        system.out.println(a);.        i++;.        a = (long) math.pow(k, i);.       }...it works fine as far as i think after that small change..but,i am not able to understand what is happening here."
