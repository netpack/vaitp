"redo shortened multiplication for loop code my homework objective is to code a 10x10 multiplication made of for loops. this was the intended output...1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10.2   4   6   8   10  12  14  16  18  20.3   6   9   12  15  18  21  24  27  30.4   8   12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40.5   10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50.6   12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60.7   14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70.8   16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80.9   18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90.10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100...to create this code, i used 2 variables (i and j) and multiplied them for each number in the table. however, my computer science teacher told me that while my code could work alright, the optimal code i needed was one line shorter. i needed to condense the second for loop with the print function that followed such...public class inputoutputexample.{.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner in = new scanner (system.in);.        for (int i = 1; i&lt;=10; i++){.            for (int j=1; j&lt;=10;j++){.                system.out.print(j*i + ""t""); .            }.            system.out.println();.        }.    }.}...for clarification the code lines: ..for (int j=1; j&lt;=10;j++){.    system.out.print(j*i + ""t"");.}...are the ones that should be ""reduced to 1 print statement"". can someone explain what that means or provide an example? thank you!"
