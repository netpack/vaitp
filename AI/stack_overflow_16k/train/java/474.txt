"how to check arithmetic sequence i want to write a program that looks for three numbers in array that gives an arithmetic sequence of length three - three numbers a,b and c form an arithmetic sequence of length 3 if: b-a = c-b...the problem is that he code doesn't print ""yes"" even when it should, it never get into the command if. i guess i have a problem when writing the math command for b-a = c-b...public static void main (string[] args)  {.    int [] a = new int [args.length - 1];w.    for (int i = 0; i&lt;a.length; i++) {.       a[i] = integer.parseint(args[i+1]);.     }.    for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length - 2; i++) {.       for (int j = i+1; j &lt; a.length - 1; j++) {.          int b = a[i];.          for (int k = j + 1; k &lt; a.length; k++) {.             int c = a[k];.             if (b - a[i] == c - b) {.               system.out.println(""yes"");.                break;.             }.           }.         }.       }.     }.   }"
