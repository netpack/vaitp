"text edit issue with replace method i'm trying to read a text file , edit some of its content and write it in another text file.while editing i'm looking for certain keywords.these keywords, if present have to be replaced by new ones.the code is reading and writing properly but the keywords are not getting replaced.i have no idea why.here is the code:..public static void main(string args[]) throws ioexception {.    bufferedreader in = new bufferedreader(new filereader(""c:/users/lenov/workspace/templateautomation/src/input/testinput.txt""));.    printwriter writer = new printwriter(""c:/users/lenov/workspace/templateautomation/src/output/testoutput.txt"", ""utf-8"");.    string line;.    while ((line = in.readline()) != null) {.        if (line.contentequals(""contractnumber"")) {.            line.replace(""contractnumber"", ""new"");.        }.        system.out.println(""system.out.println("""" + line + """");"");.        writer.println(""system.out.println("""" + line + """");"");.    }.    writer.close();.}"
