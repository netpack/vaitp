"need help with a method to randomly lay mines in a minesweeper game so my blank minesweeper game is represented as a int[][] where -1 represents a mine. when i initialize my game i need to randomly place x amount of mines...what is an elegant way of doing this? i was thinking of using an arraylist with the coordinates of each cell, randomly selecting it, changing the state of the int[][] and then removing that point. this would ensure that no point is selected twice...is there a more elegant way of doing this?"
