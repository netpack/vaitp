"console.getline and console.getstring not taking in all of user input - blank i am trying to take in user input (the name of a country) to add to a list of countries that i display. however, it is not letting me enter the name of a country longer than 8 characters. .for example, when i input ""venezuela"" the output is ""venezuel"" and when i input ""united states"" the output is ""united s"" .below is the method i used to accept the user input. i have tried console.getstring as well as console.getline and neither are working to accept more than 8 characters... public static void addcountry() {.    string name = console.getstring(""enter country name: "");..    country country = new country();.    country.setname(name);.    countrydao.add(country);..    system.out.println();.    system.out.println(name.            + "" has been added.n"");.}...i also have these methods in the console class..import blank.util.scanner;..public class console {..private static scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);..public static string getline(string prompt) {.    system.out.print(prompt);.    string s = sc.nextline();        .    return s;.}..public static string getstring(string prompt) {.    system.out.print(prompt);.    string s = sc.next();        .    sc.nextline();               .    return s;.}.}"
