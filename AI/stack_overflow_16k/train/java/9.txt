"importing two different classes with same name from different packages i imported class logger from package blank.util.logging by using import blank.util.logging.logger. in addition to that, as per requirement i need to import user created class from some other package. but the problem is, that class name also logger[created in user defined package]. i don't have permissions to change the name of that user defined class and package. both classes have the static methods...so i need to import two both classes, then what is feasible solution for this?"
