difference between interface and class in blank as per multiple articles in blank interface and class are completely different. let me write an interface...package com.main.service;..public interface someservice{.   public void somemethod();.}...but why below code is allowed in blank?.. com.main.service.someservice.class;...i am using this code to get beans from spring application context like below:-.. someservice someservice = applicationcontext.            .getbean(com.main.service.someservice.class);
