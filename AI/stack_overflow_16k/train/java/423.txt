"blank: is there a shortcut for doing this (simple accessors/getters stuff) suppose i have a class called person:..public class person .{.    private string name, id, location;.}...instead of writing individual accessors for name, id, and location, is there anyway to do something like this:..public string get%s .{.    return this.%s.}...where ""%s"" stands as a sort of place holder for the name of the string which i want to ""get"". this way, for the sake of convenience and efficiency, i will be able to write one method to access all three strings. thanks."
