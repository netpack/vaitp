"what part is a parameterized type? i understand what arraylist&lt;string&gt; list1 = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;(); does, but which part is call the parameterized type?..the type variable on the left side of the assignment operator or the constructor on the right side? when they say parameterized type, do they mean the way it's constructed where you definea parameterized type inside the angular bracket such as arraylist&lt;string&gt;()?..because i know regular list = new list() doesn't have a parameterize type...question is: which part is the parameterized type? the left or right side: arraylist&lt;string&gt; list1 or new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();"
