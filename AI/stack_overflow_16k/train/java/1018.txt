"why can't i print a variable that is provided by user inside a loop? i apologize if the answer to this question is so obvious i shouldn't even be posting this here but i've already looked up the error compiling the following code results in and found no explanation capable of penetrating my thick, uneducated skull...what this program is meant to do is get 2 integers from the user and print them, but i have somehow managed to mess up doing just that...import blank.util.scanner;..public class exercise2.{   .    int integerone, integertwo; //putting ''static'' here doesn't solve the problem.    static int number=1;.    static scanner kbinput  = new scanner(system.in);.    public static void main(string [] args)     .    {.        while (number&lt;3){.            system.out.println(""type in integer ""+number+"":"");.            if (number&lt;2).            {.                int integerone = kbinput.nextint(); //the integer i can't access.            }.            number++;.        }.        int integertwo = kbinput.nextint();.        system.out.println(integerone); //how do i fix this line?.        system.out.println(integertwo);.    }.}...explanation or a link to the right literature would be greatly appreciated...edit: i want to use a loop here for the sake of exploring multiple ways of doing what this is meant to do."
