"how to accept and execute arbitrary blank code many websites allow a user to type in blank code and run it. how does a program accept blank written externally/at run time and run it?..the only/closest answer i see on stackoverflow is from 5 years ago about android development that recommended using janino (compile and execute arbitrary blank string in android). is this still the way to go? has a better approach (like something built into blank) appeared in the last half decade?..if it helps, i'm building a training app for my students. the code is short (a few methods, maybe 20 lines max) and they must use standard libraries (no need to worry about importing things from maven, etc.). ..like similar online coding sites, i'd like to return the output of the run (or compilation failure)...an example use case:...webpage says ""the code below has an error, try to fix it."" a text box contains code. a semicolon is missing..user modifies the code and presses submit..the webpage either returns a compile error message or success....another use case would be for me to execute unit tests on the code they submitted and return the result. the point being, i give the user feedback on the code compilation/run."
