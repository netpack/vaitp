"blank - timestamping ibeacons in array list? i am working on blank code for ibeacons, that adds ibeacons to an array list when found, sorts and displays the list by closest proximity and updates an image according to nearest beacon, this i have completed. ..the issue that i am having is getting inactive ibeacons removed from my arraylist. as of now, even if ibeacon is shut off, it still remains in the list. my thought was to timestamp each instance of ibeacon as it is added to the arraylist and remove any not found in last 10 secs or so?..i am new to blank programming and i cannot for the life of me figure out how to do that. any suggestions?"
