how to get a 50/50 chance in random generator i am trying to get a 50/50 chance of get either 1 or 2 in a random generator...for example:..random random = new random();.int num = random.nextint(2)+1;...this code will output either a 1 or 2. ..let's say i run it in a loop:..for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++ ) {.    int num = random.nextint(2)+1 ;.}...how can i make the generator make an equal number for 1 and 2 in this case?..so i want this loop to generate 50 times of number 1 and 50 times of number 2.
