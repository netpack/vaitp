"error checking for user input i have a class that asks the user what type of truck they want. i need to know a way to do error checking so that if they enter something besides ""1"" or ""2"" that it tells them that it is an invalid option...here's the code:..public class inheritancetui {..    private int weight;.    private string flavors;.    private scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.    private string trucktype;...    public void run() {.        system.out.println(""type ""1"" if you want a generic truck"" + ""n"" + ""type ""2"" if you want an ice cream truck"");.        this.trucktype = this.scan.nextline();..        if (this.trucktype.equals(""1"")) {.            system.out.println(""you have chosen a generic truck!"");.            system.out.println(""type in what weight (in pounds) you want your truck to be: "");.            string stringweight = this.scan.nextline();.            this.weight = integer.parseint(stringweight);.            system.out.println(""your truck has a weight of "" + this.weight + "" pounds"");.        }..        if (this.trucktype.equals(""2"")) {.            system.out.println(""you have chosen an ice cream truck! "" + this.trucktype);.            system.out.println(""type in what weight (in pounds) that you want your ice cream truck to be: "");.            string stringweight = this.scan.nextline();.            this.weight = integer.parseint(stringweight);.            system.out.println(""you have entered a weight of "" + this.weight + "" pounds"");.            system.out.println(""what flavors do you want in your ice cream truck?"");.            this.flavors = this.scan.nextline();.            system.out.println(""your ice cream truck has a weight of "" + this.weight + "" pounds and contains "" + this.flavors + "" flavor(s)"");.        }.    }.}"
