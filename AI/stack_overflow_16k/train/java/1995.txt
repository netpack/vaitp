"2d array and a loop within an interval i need to crate a loop which sums the arrays values which are within the interval (for instance 2-5). my main problem is getting from the first checked value of the array to the next one and so on. thankyou in advance...int x=0,y=0,s=0;.int[][] myarray = { {0,1,2,3}, {3,2,1,0}, {3,5,6,1}, {3,8,3,4} };  .scanner scan = new scanner(system.in); .int b = scan.nextint();//lowest value.int c = scan.nextint(); //highest value.if (myarray[x][y]&gt;b || myarray[x][y]&lt;c).    s=s+myarray[x][y]  .//then check next one"
