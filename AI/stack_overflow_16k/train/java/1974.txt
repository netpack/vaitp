"trying to randomize positions of nodes without any overlapping blankfx i have created a for loop to add all my nodes to the root although since their locations are random, a bunch of them end up overlapping...i added a for loop to move a node if it overlaps another although that doesnt really solve the issue since it may just overlap another...anyone know a good way to end up with no overlapping nodes?..here is my code:..for (int i = 0; i &lt; citiestext.length; i++) {..citiestext[i] = new text(cities[i][0]);.citiestext[i].setfont(font.font(""impact"", 40));.citiestext[i].setfill(color.white);.citiestext[i].setstrokewidth(2); .citiestext[i].setstroke(color.black); ..double height = citiestext[i].getboundsinparent().getheight();.double width = citiestext[i].getboundsinparent().getwidth();.double maxx = 1000 - width;.double maxy = 550 - height;..root.getchildren().add(citiestext[i]);.citiestext[i].relocate(math.random()*maxx, math.random()*maxy);..for (int j = 0; j &lt; i; j++) {..if (citiestext[i].getboundsinparent().intersects(citiestext[j].getboundsinparent())).    citiestext[i].relocate(math.random()*maxx, math.random()*maxy); .}   ...}"
