"read from 1 file to produce 2 files i've been trying to do this problem for my schoolwork and for the life of me i cannot figure it out. .the problem is: write a program that reads in ""worked_example_1/babynames.txt"" and produces two files, boynames.txt and girlnames.txt, separating the data for the boys and girls...this is the code from worked example 11 from wiley.com/go/blankexamples for this problem:..import blank.io.file;.import blank.io.filenotfoundexception;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class babynames.{.public static final double limit = 50;..public static void main(string[] args) throws filenotfoundexception.{.    scanner in = new scanner(new file(""babynames.txt""));..    recordreader boys = new recordreader(limit);.    recordreader girls = new recordreader(limit);..    while (boys.hasmore() || girls.hasmore()).    {.        int rank = in.nextint();.        system.out.print(rank + "" "");.        boys.process(in);.        girls.process(in);.        system.out.println();.    }..    in.close();.}.}...and this:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class recordreader.{.private double total;.private double limit;..public recordreader(double alimit).{.    total = 0;.    limit = alimit;.}..public void process(scanner in).{.    string name = in.next();.    int count = in.nextint();.    double percent = in.nextdouble();..    if (total &lt; limit).    {.        system.out.print(name + "" "");.    }..    total = total + percent;.}..public boolean hasmore().{.    return total &lt; limit;.}.}...i created the babynames.txt and put in the same src folder as the .blank file, it comes up with file not found, if i give the direct path to the file with..scanner in = new scanner(new file(""c:/users/me/skydrive/schoolwork/cis150ab/chapter 11.1/src/babynames.txt""));...it finds the file but gives me this error:..exception in thread ""main"" blank.util.inputmismatchexception.at blank.util.scanner.throwfor(unknown source).at blank.util.scanner.next(unknown source).at blank.util.scanner.nextint(unknown source).at blank.util.scanner.nextint(unknown source).at babynames.main(babynames.blank:20)...to me it looks like this error is because of line 20 where int rank = in.nextint(); and its looking for a string when its looking for an int, but this is directly from wiley website so i am not sure...any help with this would be appreciated, apparently i am not meant for online classes for blank. next class i am taking in school once there is one that works around my schedule."
