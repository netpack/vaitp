"sloc tool for blank with man-years estimation i'm looking for a tool to count source lines of code for blank as well as giving an estimate of the number of man-years invested in the code. since blank code tends to be more verbose than other languages, with a lot of boilerplate code (anemic beans) generated by the ide, i want the tool's metric to take this into account...if someone can just provide the formula to convert source line count to man years (for blank), this is also good."
