"reversing a singly linked, sentinel based, list recursively (works, but not in the way i'd like it to) i'm preparing for interviews and wrote up this simple function for recursively reversing a singly linked list.  the first node is a sentinel node, head. the following code works fine for: list.reverse(list.head.next), but i can't seem to get it to work if i just pass it head...public node&lt;t&gt; reverse(node&lt;t&gt; current).{.    if (current == null).        return head;..    if (current.next == null).    {.        head.next = current;.        return current;.    }..    reverse(current.next).next = current;.    current.next = null;.    return current;.}...i assume it doesn't work when i pass it head instead of head.next because i say current.next = null, but even if i check if current == head or if current.data == null and only use current.next = null when those aren't true, it still doesn't work.  i'm sure there's a really simple fix, but i'm just not seeing it right now...the above if passed head returns an empty list, and if the suggested changes are made, simply doesn't finish running, but i don't get any sort of error."
