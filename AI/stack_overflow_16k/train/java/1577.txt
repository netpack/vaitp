"run method inside a method in blank i'm sending more than 1 request to a web service, below there is an example of that requests. its important for my application to get the answer from the web service so if there is an exception application will try couple of times to get the answer...because of that getting something simple like .devicelist  = serviceadapter.getdevices(); is turn into below code...boolean flag = true;.int counter = 1;.list&lt;device&gt; devicelist = null;..while (flag) {.   try {.        devicelist  = serviceadapter.getdevices(); .        flag = false;.   } catch (exception e) {.           try {.                if (counter == 5) {.                    system.out.println(""timeout occured!"");.                    flag = false;.                } else {.                    thread.sleep(1000 * counter);.                    counter++;.                }.            } catch (interruptedexception e1) {.            }.    }.}...and in my application i have lots of requests which means there will be more ugly codes. is there a way where i will call my request methods as parameter for another method something like this:..devicelist = wrappermethod(serviceadapter.getdevices());...problem is there will be different type of requests, so they will return different type objects (list,array,string,int) and their paramaters will change. is there a suitable solution in blank for this problem?"
