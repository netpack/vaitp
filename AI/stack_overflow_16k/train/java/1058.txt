"do something upon file exist so i created a blank program that outputs to a file (classname.blank) the basic template of a blank program... ..    /*.    nathaly morcillo.    nov 19 2013.    header comments .    */.    public class test{.       public static void main string([] args){.       } .    }...however what i don't understand is:...  after collecting the required input, check to see if the requested file (classname.blank) already exists. if it does not, the program proceeds as described above. if it does exist, the program simply adds the header comments (because you probably didnâ€™t put them in before anyhow). hint: since you have to read from then write to the same file, try using..   scanner scan = new scanner(file); .   scan.usedelimiter(""\z"");.   string content = scan.next();..  .  method to read in and store the contents of the whole file before writing out the file plus the new header comments....i don't understand what to do with the scan.usedelimiter(""\z"");..what i have is:..file outputfile = new file(outputfilename);.if (outputfile.exists()) {.} else {.    pout.println(.    system.out.println(""contents of file"");.    pout.close();.}"
