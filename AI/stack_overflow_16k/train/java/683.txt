"blank how to programm deitel book exercise 6.35 i've been studying deitel's book(blank how to program) and i want to solve exercise 6.35. here's what it asks:..write a program to assist a student to learn multiplication.use a random object to produce two positive integers (one digit each)..the program should show on screen something like this:(""how much is 7 times 3"")..then the student should insert the answer and the program controls if the answer is correct or wrong.if it's correct the program continue asking another question,else the program waits until the student answer is correct.for every new question it must be a new method created(this method should be called once when the application starts and when the user answers correct to a question)...how do i do this?..//i have a problem inside the do-while block!..      package multiplication;.import blank.util.random;.import blank.util.scanner;../*hey again! i've been trying to solve this problem using netbeans environment. *. */...public class ypologismos.{.    private int p;.    private int a,b;..    public ypologismos(int a,int b,int p).    {.        this.a=a;.        this.b=b;.        this.p=p;..    }... public ypologismos(). {... }....... public void screen(). {.     system.out.println(""wrong answer ....please retry"");. }.......    public void askfornumbers().    {.        random r=new random();..        int a,b;.        a=r.nextint(10);.        b=r.nextint(10);.        int p;//p=product.        p=(a*b);.        system.out.println(""how much is:""+"" ""+a+"" ""+""times""+"" ""+b+"" ""+""?"");..        system.out.println(""please insert your answer!"");..       scanner s=new scanner(system.in);.       int ans;//ans=answer.       ans=s.nextint();..       do.       {.           while(ans==p){..               system.out.println(""well done!"");.               askfornumbers();.           }..       }while(ans!=p);...    }.......}...//and my main class .....package multiplication;...public class main.{...    public static void main(string[] args).    {..        ypologismos application=new ypologismos();..        application.askfornumbers();...    }..}"
