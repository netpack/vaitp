"how can i get rid of the error blank:30: error: 'else' without 'if' else if? and why must it be else if? here's the code:..import blank.util.scanner;.public class fantahunkeburalmostisoscelesrighttriangle{.public static void main (string []args){..    scanner s = new scanner(system.in);..    system.out.println(""enter the longest side: "");.    double longest = s.nextdouble();.    system.out.println(""enter 2nd side: "");.    double second = s.nextdouble();.    system.out.println(""enter 3rd side: "");.    double third = s.nextdouble();..    double longsq = longest*longest;.    double secondsq = second*second;.    double thirdsq = third*third;.    double secthirdsq = secondsq*thirdsq;..if  (secthirdsq==longsq);.{.system.out.println(""this triangle is an almost-isosceles right triangle. "");..}.else {.system.out.println(""this triangle is not a right triangle. "");...}}.}...i tried else if (secthirdsq!=longsq); so it would then print this triangle is not a right triangle. but i got about 6 errors after that so any help would be appreciated! .if anymore info is needed feel free to ask"
