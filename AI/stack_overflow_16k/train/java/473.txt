how to keep track of time (to have player ignore damage for 3 seconds)? i have some code that looks like this: ..if there is a collision between player and enemy.    player.health--...i want to do this: ..if there is a collision between player and enemy.    player.health--.    wait for 3 seconds...this is to ignore collision for a bit so player's health doesn't instantly drop to 0. ..how would i implement some sort of timer for this?
