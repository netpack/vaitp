"blank list of objects inheritance issues i have a class called interpreter. it is inherited by a few classes, including a class called loadstep...i have created a list of objects:..public static list&lt;interpreter&gt; fileactions = new arraylist&lt;interpreter&gt;();...objects were added in this way:..if (actionname.equals(""load"")) {.    loadstep loadaction = new loadstep();.    fileactions.add(loadaction);.}...when trying to access my objects and call their methods, i am unable to access the child class methods. i was expecting to, because when i try getclass() to see the object class, i get the child class name...    for (int i = linenumber; i &lt; test.fileactions.size(); i++) {..        system.out.println(test.fileactions.get(i).getclass());.        if (test.fileactions.get(i) instanceof loadstep) {.            loadstep newaction = test.fileactions.get(i);.            mymemoryaddress = test.fileactions.get(i).getmemoryaddress(); //this line gives me cannot find symbol, as getmemoryaddress is loadstep's method, and not interpreter.        } .    }...the print statement gives me:..class test.loadstep"
