"blank set object to null by reference it's not the first year i use blank for development, but i faced this issue the very first time. i have pretty complex permission module in my system which modifies object i return to the client in accordance with access control list. ..to be short, i need to nullify object passed to another function. here is some code:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    string s = ""filled"";.    nullify(s);.    system.out.println(s);.    s = null;.    system.out.println(s);.}..public static void nullify(string target) {.    target = null;.}...i understand that s is passed to nullify() by value and when i setting target to null it doesn't affect s. my question is there any way in blank which allows me to set s to null having target? ..thanks...p.s. i found lots of information about setting variables to null but all of them was related to garbage collection and didn't answer my question."
