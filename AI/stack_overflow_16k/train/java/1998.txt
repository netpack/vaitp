"reading input to one line allow me provide more information with what i'm having trouble with. say i have some code ..int a;.system.out.print(enter a number "");.a = keyboard.nextint...the first statement will be..enter a number...the user then enters a number, say 12, the final statement is ..enter a number 12...notice how this is all on one line. im trying to do the same thing, but with a float and i want it to only show 2 digits after the decimal. i tried..float money;.system.out.printf(""enter your money "" + ""%.2fn"", money);.money = keyboard.nextfloat();...but i get an error saying money hasn't been initialized. however, if i write ..float money = 0.0f;.system.out.printf(""%.2fn"", money + ""enter your money "");.money = keyboard.nextfloat();...the output isn't what i want, its..enter your money 0.00...the user then enters their money, say 1234.567. the final output is ..enter your money 0.00.1234.58...so, how can i display 1234.58 so that the final output is..enter your money 1234.58"
