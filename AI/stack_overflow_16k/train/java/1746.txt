"how to get time difference relative to official business hour i have to show total working hour of employee  relative to official business hour..if a task is started then start time and end time entered in to database...entry something like:..start time= `2013-10-18 16:06:16.840`.end time=`2013-10-22 16:09:09.760`...working hour is configurable as per organization...working hour= 7.45 (7 hour and 45 minutes) =1 day..if someone is worked more then working hour, it consider under extra work and consider as extra time...i need output according to user worked for a day. output for one day like..7.45  hour then 1 days .7.50 hour then 1 days and 5 minute.14.50 hour then 1 days, 7 hour and 5 minutes...i have done below coding. it is not giving as much as acurate result of my expect...what i done:..1) take difference of two days.2) instead of using 24 hour, i used business hour....code:.. public static long[] gettimedifference(date d1,date d2,int holiday,string businesshour).    {.    long hour=0;.     if(businesshour.indexof(""."")!=-1).     {.     hour=long.valueof(businesshour.substring(0,businesshour.indexof(""."")));///check for hour.     }.     else.     {.     hour=long.valueof(businesshour);.     }.     long[] time=new long[3];.     long diff = d2.gettime() - d1.gettime();..     //double diffseconds = diff / 1000 % 60;.     long diffminutes = diff / (60 * 1000) % 60;.     long diffhours =  (diff / (60 * 60 * 1000) % hour);.     long diffdays =   (diff / (hour * 60 * 60 * 1000));.    diffdays=diffdays-holiday;.     time[0]=diffdays;.     time[1]=diffhours;.     time[2]=diffminutes;..     return time;.    }...output:.11 days: 05 hours: 02 minutes..i am not included minute logic yet, how can i do implementation? i don't have idea. i am confuse with this."
