"average comparison i'm working on this blank project that calculates the average of numbers. everything seems to be working fine after i populated it with some dummy input...however, i realized that when i change the positions of same numbers, i get different results...for instance average of {3.1, 4.7, 5.2, 14.4, 1.1} is 5.7.and average of {3.1, 4.7, 14.4, 1.1, 5.2} is 5.700000000000001...this makes the comparator return false when comparing some of these numbers (even the ones i have prior knowledge of the result)..is there something i'm missing?"
