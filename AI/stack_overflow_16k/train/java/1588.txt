"integer - tostring() function i search but cannot find on the web...is there a function that can represent any integer into its string litteral representation ?..example :..integer i1 = new integer(4);.integer i2 = new integer(30);.i1.callsomefunction();.i2.callsomefunction();..output :.""four"".""thirty""...if you know another function which isn't in the integer class, it's fine too."
