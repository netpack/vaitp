"picking and choosing variables to activate and a user input method to do so i have 14 variables that i have defined, but only want these to apply to a logarithm i have developed when explicitly called on via user input. the logarithm i've made is for a tabletop rpg group of mine for character creation and uses ""elemental alignments"" in order to influence statistical data. the most a person can use are 5 of these at any time but no less than one...double elemfire.double elemice.double elemwater.double elemwind.double elemearth.double elempoison.double elemgravity.double elemshadow.double elemlight.double elemelec.double elemholy.double elemanti.double elemvoid.double elemtime...how would i call these specific variables using user input and ensure that a minimum of one and a maximum of 5 can be used at any given time?..the logarithm for calculations is absolutely massive as is and i do not want to have to make 14 more copies of that massive block of code. the biggest ambition is to cause the 1-5 variables called on to add a cumulative effect to the core stats for easier display...this is the logarithm...scanner sin = new scanner(system.in);.      system.out.print(""what year were you born? :"");..      yearborn = sin.nextdouble();.      loghpcalc = 2.0 / 16.0;.      yourhp = yearborn * loghpcalc;.      yourmp = yourhp / 2.0;.      yournp = yourmp / 3.0;.          yourpsi = yournp + yourmp / 32.0;.            logatk = yearborn / 60.0;.            logdef = yearborn / 120.0;.            logmag = yearborn / 60.0;.            logspr = yearborn / 120.0;.            logspd = yearborn / 60.0;.            loglck = yearborn / 120.0;.            logeatk = yearborn / 60.0;.            logedef = yearborn / 120.0;.                statatk = yourhp / 2.0 + logatk;.                statdef = yourhp / 3.0 + logdef;.                statspr = yourmp / 2.0 + logspr;.                statmag = yourmp / 3.0 + logmag;.                statspd = yournp / 2.0 + logspd;.                statlck = yournp / 3.0 + loglck;.                stateatk = yourpsi / 2.0 + logeatk;.                statedef = yourpsi / 3.0 + logedef;..      system.out.print(""what year is it? :"");..                yearnow = sin.nextdouble();.                loghpcalcnow = loghpcalc * yearnow + 2.0 * 32.0;.                yourhpnow = yearborn * loghpcalcnow;.            yourmpnow = yourhpnow / 2.0;.                yournpnow = yourmpnow / 3.0;.                yourpsinow = yourmpnow + yournpnow / 32.0;.                    logatknow = yearborn / 60.0 * yearnow + 2.0 * 32.0;.                    logdefnow = yearborn / 120.0 * yearnow + 2.0 * 32.0;.                    logmagnow = yearborn / 60.0 * yearnow + 2.0 * 32.0;.                    logsprnow = yearborn / 120.0 * yearnow + 2.0 * 32.0;.                    logspdnow = yearborn / 60.0 * yearnow + 2.0 * 32.0;.                    loglcknow = yearborn / 120.0 * yearnow + 2.0 * 32.0;.                    logeatknow = yearborn / 60.0 * yearnow * 2.0 * 32.0;.                    logedefnow = yearborn / 120.0 * yearnow * 2.0 * 32.0;.                        statatknow = yourhpnow / 2.0 + logatknow;.                        statdefnow = yourhpnow / 3.0 + logdefnow;.                        statsprnow = yourmpnow / 2.0 + logsprnow;.                        statmagnow = yourmpnow / 3.0 + logmagnow;.                        statspdnow = yournpnow / 2.0 + logspdnow;.                        statlcknow = yournpnow / 3.0 + loglcknow;.                        stateatknow = yourpsinow / 200.0 + logeatknow;.                        statedefnow = yourpsinow / 300.0 + logedefnow;..        nonhpbase    = 200;.        nonatkbase   = 5;.        nondefbase   = 5;.        nonspdbase   = 4;.        nonlckbase   = 2;.        nonhpgain    = nonhpbase * nondefbase -
