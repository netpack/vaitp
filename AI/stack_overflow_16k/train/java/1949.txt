"effective blank: should i override equals() and hashcode() if the objects i'm creating are never compared with each other? if the objects i create are not used for comparisons such as list.contains(new employee(""mm"")), and also  if those objects will only be stored in lists returned from a database such as list&lt;employee&gt;employeelist = employeeservice.getemployeelist(); then do i need to override equals() and hashcode() in employee class?"
