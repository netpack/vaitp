"bufferedwriter not writing text unless using try-with-resource statement i have some blank code that writes text to a file using bufferedwriter. it works fine if i use the following code:..    try(bufferedwriter bw = new bufferedwriter(new filewriter(filepath))).    {.        for(int i = 0; i &lt; lines.length; i++).        {.            bw.write(lines[i]);.            system.out.println(""writing: "" + lines[i]);..            if(i != lines.length - 1) bw.newline();.        }.        bw.flush();.        bw.close();.    }.    catch(exception ex).    {..    }...as you can see i am declaring the ""bw"" variable in the try statement. however, the try-with-resource statement was introduced with a newer version of blank that is unavailable in the software that is requiring the code...below is an example of what i think should have the same outcome, but without using the try-with-resource statement:..    try.    {.        bufferedwriter bw = new bufferedwriter(new filewriter(filepath));.        for(int i = 0; i &lt; lines.length; i++).        {.            bw.write(lines[i]);.            system.out.println(""writing: "" + lines[i]);..            if(i != lines.length - 1) bw.newline();.        }.        bw.flush();.        bw.close();.    }.    catch(exception ex).    {..    }...this code clears the text file of any content, unlike the try-with-resource example code that writes to the text file as expected...any ideas why this is happening? cheers"
