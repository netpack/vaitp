"reading a file with no extension in a zip file i am struggling to find a solution reading a zip file .the zip has a file with stringified json but there is no extension to the file...i tried using the api zipinputstream part of the package blank.util.zip.zipinputstream ,however the code never goes into the sysout mentioned below in the code ..inputstream initialstream = new fileinputstream(.                new file(""d:\test_data.zip""));.        zipinputstream zipinputstream = new zipinputstream(initialstream);.        try {.            zipentry entry;.            while ((entry = zipinputstream.getnextentry()) != null) {.                system.out.printf(""file: %s size %d modified on %td %n"", entry.getname(), entry.getsize(),.                        new date(entry.gettime()));.            }.        } finally {.            zipinputstream.close();.        }"
