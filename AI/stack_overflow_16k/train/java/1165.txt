"printing match from tree i am trying to create a ""word completion"" tree blank program from a dictionary that is a text file but i am not sure where to go from here. the word completion program will match any words that start with the string entered. i am new to blank/ programming. i have designed the tree as a multi way tree with each node storing a character as a letter and a boolean variable to indicate if it is the end of the word (amongst other things). ..i am at the point where i am trying to see if my reading in of the file into the tree is working correct. however when i try to print my tree, it is not working correctly. it is not displaying the first letter correctly in every word after the first word. instead of reading in from file, for testing purposes i am simply adding only 4 words to tree (base, basement, ma, matthew)...so my question is can anyone tell me why it is not printing correctly and what i need to do next in order to finish the word completion?..thank you so much in advance to everyone for taking the time to help me with my problem"
