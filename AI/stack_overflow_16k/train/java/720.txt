"question about splitting a string by commas string test1 = ""39,""gsl 2012 season 5 code s"",,true"";.string[] values = test1.split("","");.system.out.println(values[1]);.if (values[2] == null) {.    system.out.println(""yep"");.}...this code prints out ""gsl 2012 season 5 code s"" for values[1] but for values 2 it prints out nothing, as expected. i want to know how to access that values[2]. when i do the if statement it does not output yup. how can i tell that values[2] is empty because of the ,, in the string? what can i put in the if statement to make it print out yup in this case?"
