"listener for incoming messages i am currently trying to create a chat application using the socket and serversocket classes, but i kinda ran into a roadblock. i need some kind of listener to execute a certain block of code when a message is incoming from the server or the client, but i can't seem to find one. an option would of course be to just check for incoming messages every 10 ms or something, but isn't there a smarter solution?"
