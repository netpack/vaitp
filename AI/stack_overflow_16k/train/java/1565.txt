"creating undefined method behavior in blank? i have got a task about a board game to suggest the best move via a method when we get an in-progress game state. i have to do it in blank...there is a strange instruction in the task: if we get a state which can't occur in normal play then ""the behavior of this method is undefined"". (you can imagine this state like in chess you get a board with two kings on adjacent fields, which can't be happened in a real chess game.)..the question is: what can this instruction mean? is there anybody who has already faced with a same problem?..first, i thought that in such a state i should throw, for example, an illegalstateexception. but according to another instruction line i have to throw illegalstateexception when i get a board with a state representing that one of the players has already won the game, or it is draw...i have already searched for the definition of undefined behavior, but i don't know how can i use it in this case. at all, can i create this kind of behavior in blank which can be connected to this kind of case?"
