"using boolean to exit loops and then redo the loops i'm fairly new to blank, so i don't know too many fancy stuff and i'm kind of stuck...what i need to do is, take a text file; import the content into an arraylist; check each line for a specific char that is between two ""#""; then check each line in the arraylist again to see if one of the lines already has that char; if it does, then i need to re-enter the whole string line and re-check it; and if it doesn't, then i need to put it at the bottom of the arraylist and into the text file. ..so far, i've gotten to the part where i need to check if the entered line's char is repeating, but i can only do it once. if, for example, i enter it again i would get an indexoutofboundsexception because of one of the loops. so, i figured i'd use a boolean to exit the loops and re-enter them, but unfortunately, after entering the whole string once, it asks me to do it again in order to repeat the process because i'm exiting and entering the wrong loop, but i can't seem to figure out which...arraylist&lt;string&gt; prices = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();.    try (bufferedreader br = new bufferedreader (new filereader(""file.txt""))){.        string currentline;.        while ((currentline = br.readline()) != null){.            prices.add(currentline);.        }.    }catch (ioexception e) {.        e.printstacktrace();.    }.    boolean checksequence = true;.    boolean redo = false;.    string stringarrayprices[] = new string[prices.size()];.    scanner sc = new scanner (system.in);.    while (checksequence == true){.        system.out.println(""insert product in the following format, 'product#letter#number': "");.        string productstring = sc.nextline();.        char productarray[] = productstring.tochararray();.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; prices.size(); i++){.            stringarrayprices[i] = prices.get(i);.            char chararrayprice[] = stringarrayprices[i].tochararray();.            for (int j = 0; j &lt; chararrayprice.length &amp;&amp; redo == false; j++){.                if (chararrayprice[j] == '#' &amp;&amp; chararrayprice[j+2] == '#'){.                    char temporaryletter = chararrayprice[j];.                    for (int k = 0; k &lt; productarray.length &amp;&amp; redo == false; k++){.                        if (productarray[k] == '#' &amp;&amp; productarray[k+2] == '#'){.                            char temporaryletter2 = productarray[k];.                            if (temporaryletter == temporaryletter2){.                                system.out.println(""the letter is repeating. enter product again or exit by writing '-1': "");.                                productstring = sc.nextline();.                                if (productstring == ""-1""){.                                    checksequence = false;.                                }.                                redo = true;.                            }.                            if (temporaryletter != temporaryletter2){.                                prices.add(productstring);.                            }.                        }.                    }.                }.            }..        }.    }...right now, when i re-enter the string, i'm greeted with the first message """"insert product in the following format, 'product#letter#number': """", instead of the """"the letter is repeating. enter product again or exit by writing '-1': """"...the first line should only show up when i'm entering a completely new string instead of when the previous one's repeating...i hope i didn't make this too confusing."
