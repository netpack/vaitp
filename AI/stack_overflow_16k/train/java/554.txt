"custom png cursor - edges are not smooth i wanted to create a custom cursor. instead of the default one i tried to set this: , but the final effect was terrible. the edges were black and jagged: ...., exactly like in this applet at the bootom...the code is as follows:..final image customcursor = new imageicon(""c:\users\my_name\desktop\apple.png"").getimage();.final point hotspot = new point(0, 0);.final string name = ""cursor"";..this.setcursor(gettoolkit().createcustomcursor(customcursor, hotspot, name));...is there any workaround to get png cursor with smooth edges? it seems unbelievable that there is still such a bug in blank."
