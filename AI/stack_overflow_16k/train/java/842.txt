"passing 2 generics in priority queue i want to keep two things in my priority queue...one is a number and the other is cost. i.e. i want to do the following:..priorityqueue&lt;integer, cost&gt; q=new priorityqueue&lt;integer, cost&gt;();...cost is another class that i hav:..class cost implements comparable&lt;cost&gt;.{.  string name;.  double cost;..  @override.  public int compareto(cost s).  {.    return double.compare(cost, s.cost);.  }. }...also i want to perform comparisons only based on cost...but i also want some integer identifier to be passed along with cost...is there some way to achieve this?..i need to retrieve cost based on id..therefore i am using a hash map for it. when using an id field in cost...i want to retrieve the entire cost instance based on that id field...is it possible...is yes, then how? ..i am a novice at blank programming. can someone pls suggest some way out?"
