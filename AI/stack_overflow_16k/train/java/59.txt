"issue with setting 40th bit of long variable i'm playing around with bit manipulation in blank and i'm having a problem setting the 40th bit of a long variable. when i do that, it just circles back to the 8th bit. so, that to me means that it is 32bit (instead of 64). however, my understanding is that long/long is 2^64 in blank. i'm probably missing something here...here's the test code i've been toying around with in .code.sololearn.com..   long k = 256l; .   long x = long.valueof((1 &lt;&lt; 40));..   system.out.println(x);...the above code returns 256."
