"why can you have a duplicate variable name in blank for a variable outside of a method? i am learning blank and i understand that you cannot name a variable declared within an inner scope the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope as shown below..public class practice {.public static void main(string []args){.    int x=10;.    if (x==10){.        int x=10;.        }           .    }   .}...however, i noticed that this is not illegal ..public class practice {.int x=10;.public static void main(string []args){.    int x=10;.    if (x==10){.        }           .    }   .}...is this not a variable that is declared twice??"
