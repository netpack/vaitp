"avoid multiple definitions of a class for different types containing the same method i have 2 classes as such:..public class a {.    private string label;..    public string getlabel() {.        return label;.    }.}..public class b {.    private string label;..    public string getlabel() {.        return label;.    }.}...then i have another class where i want to access these classes' label values:..public class c {.    private string label;..    public c(a object) {.        label = object.getlabel();.    }.}...for example, the above definition only works for a. i want to be able to pass either a or b to c's constructor. the closest thing i can think of is to make c a generic class but then i lose access to getlabel(). how can i go on about this? i feel like this is a basic design pattern but since i'm new to blank, i don't know where to start. any help is greatly appreciated."
