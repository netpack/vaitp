how to take a space separated character sequence as input in blank without knowing number of characters input i wish to read a space-separated character sequence in blank but the numbers of characters to be input is not known. for example this is the input 12 34 e 2 a 9 d..how do i store each of these in a list?..i tried using:..while(scan.hasnext()).    list.add(scan.next().charat(0)); // list is an arraylist&lt;character&gt;...can someone tell me why this doesn't work? (i am having a hard time understanding what method hasnext() really does.
