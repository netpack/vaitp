"delay by 1 millisecond not working? i am trying to generate a number using:..system.currenttimemillis()...i have to generate these numbers sometimes 5 times in a row, which happens so fast that they are the same (but i don't want them to be the same as we are using them as part of a unique field)..i thought i could put a delay in between when each one is generated, which would prevent them from being the same, using:..timeunit.milliseconds.sleep(1);...but this still generates the same number. it only seems to generate a new one if i increase it to about 60 and above. i am trying to understand why this is? thanks"
