"how does a blank thread behave when a method is accessed externally? suppose i have the following thread:..public class mythread {.    public void run() {.        while (true) {.            // do something forever.        }.    }.}...then i instantiate the thread as follows:..mythread thread = new mythread();...what happens if i now call..thread.performsomefunction()...specifically, how does performsomefunction interact with the infinite loop above?  does it have to wait for the loop to sleep?  or can they both run ""concurrently""?"
