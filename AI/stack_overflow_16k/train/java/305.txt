"how to call super() when referring to a member of the child class i have a parent class..public class parent.{.    database m_d;.    parent(database d){.        m_d = d;.    }.}...and a child class..public class child extends parent implements blank.lang.autocloseable.{.    childdatabase m_d.    child().    {.        // error on the next statement:.        // ""cannot reference m_database before supertype constructor.        // has been called"".        super(m_d = createdatabase());.    }.}...note that childdatabase implements blank.lang.autocloseable which is a reason why i need to keep a childdatabase reference in the child class. note that childdatabase extends database...the problem is that super(m_d = createdatabase()); is not valid since you can't refer to child class members in the call to super...is there a syntax i'm missing which would allow me to do this? an alternative would be to implement a getdatabase() method in parent, and cast that result to a childdatabase to store as m_d;, but that seems a smell to me...note that createdatabase can be static."
