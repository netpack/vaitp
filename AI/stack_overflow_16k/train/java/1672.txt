"loop through points with a step size, inclusive of end point i have a start and end point, i'd like to loop through them using a specific step size, but i need to ensure that the end point is included. is the following the best way to accomplish this, or is there a better way?..double start = 2.1;.double end = 5.3;.double step = 0.6;.for(double i = start; i &lt;= end; i += step) {.    // do stuff..    if(i != end &amp;&amp; (i + step) &gt; end) {.        i = end;.    }.}"
