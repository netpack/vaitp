"how can i avoid error: could not find or load main class i'm starting to learn blank and this is my program:..package hello;..public class hello {..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        system.out.println(""hello"");.    }.}...i opened the terminal and went to my working directory:..cd /path/to/directory/...then compiled the program:..blankc hello.blank...then attempted to run it:..blank hello...and i get this:..error: could not find or load main class hello...but if i remove package hello; everything works...why does removing that line make the program work and what can i do to make my program work and still keep the package line?..i looked around, and can't find a clear answer to my question. people say...  type blank -cp . hello and don't use .class after hello...but that doesn't work for me."
