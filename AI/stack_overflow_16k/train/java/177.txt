"check if a path is valid or legal in blank .  possible duplicate:.  is there a way in blank to determine if a path is valid without attempting to create a file?  .....i want to check if a string is a valid path name for a folder or a file. valid path names can be like c:gameswarcraft and invalid path is c:[][]games\warcraft. how do i check if this is correct ?..i am not interested in checking if that file or folder exists. i don't want to use any external libraries like apache commons to do it, just plain old blank...also, i want to we make my code system independent - update that is not necessary though..clues please ! :)"
