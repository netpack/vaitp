"implementing an boolean statement in a switch so i'm currently doing a first year university assignment and i'm a little stuck on one of the questions. it goes as such..modify the settype() and setplan() methods to return a boolean true/false if the chosen type or plan was invalid. i.e if the type was ""bogus"", ignore the type, and return a ""false"" to the call. modify the test class to add an ""if"" statement that will report a false call...my current line of code for the method looks like this:..public void settype(string newtype) {.    switch (newtype) {.        case ""basic"":.            mtype = newtype;.            break..        case ""enhanced"":.            mtype = newtype;.            break..        default:.            break.}...my question is, how do i go about adding an if statement and does anything need to be changed to make the void method return a true/false value?"
