"intuitive understanding on this page: https://docs.oracle.com/blankse/tutorial/blank/blankoo/constructors.html...  a class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from.  the class blueprint. constructor declarations look like method.  declarationsâ€”except that they use the name of the class and have no.  return type. for example, bicycle has one constructor:..public bicycle(int startcadence, int startspeed, int startgear) {.    gear = startgear;.    cadence = startcadence;.    speed = startspeed;.}..  .  to create a new bicycle object called mybike, a constructor is.  called by the new operator:..bicycle mybike = new bicycle(30, 0, 8);..  .  new bicycle(30, 0, 8) creates space in memory for the object and.  initializes its fields.""...so i've done js before and over there declaring a new object would be something like var newobject = new bicycle(params);..however, what i've noticed here is that when you are creating a new object, you say bicycle mybike = new bicycle(params);..why is the word bicycle used twice? how does that work?"
