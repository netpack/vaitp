"palindrome parser logic error i'm trying to create a program that parses through an input and determines whether or not it is a palindrome. pasted below is my code so far:..import blank.util.scanner;.//gets a message and shift amount and caesar shifts the message by the desired amount. displays the enciphered message..public class robustpalchecker{.   public static void main(string[] args){..      //declare variables.      char current, currentreverse;.      int msgint;.      string msg, msgreverse;.      stringbuffer sbmsg, newmsg;..      scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);.      //get message.      system.out.println(""please enter an integer: "");.      msg = sc.nextline().touppercase();.      //msgreverse = new stringbuffer(msg).reverse().tostring();  .      system.out.println(msg);.      //system.out.println(""= "" + msgreverse);.      //get first and last index of string to check if it's a palindrome..      for(int i = 0; i &lt; msg.length(); i++) {.         current = msg.charat(i);          .         if(character.isletter(current) == false){.            sbmsg = new stringbuffer(msg);.            newmsg = sbmsg.deletecharat(i); .            msgreverse = new stringbuffer(newmsg).reverse().tostring();.         }.      }  ...      if(newmsg.equals(msgreverse)) {.                  system.out.println(""it's a palindrome"");.      }else {.                  system.out.println(""it's not a palindrome"");.      }   .   }.}...ignore comments as some of them don't apply and i have not cleaned it up yet. the line of code that i'm pretty sure is causing the error is the isletter line. the goal of that loop is to find any character that is not a letter and just delete it, and that includes whitespace. that last if statement is the one that actually compares the reversed string and regular string. now the output that the last if statement is giving me when i try to compile is ""variable newmsg might not have been initialized"" and the same for msgreverse, but that's not my main question..my main question is: is my logic here correct or incorrect?..also, if you need me to rephrase the question, i can do that as i understand this might be hard to follow, i'm just panicking a little."
