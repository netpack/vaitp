"stacks and objects (public classes) i need a container to keep track of a bunch of objects (public class note), and a stack seems to be perfect for what i need. the container's called listofnotes. but when i try to push a note onto the stack with:..listofnotes.push(note0),...the compiler gives me this error:...  warning: [unchecked] unchecked call to push(e) as a member of the raw type stack....does this mean stacks can't hold objects, or am i using the command ""push"" wrong?"
