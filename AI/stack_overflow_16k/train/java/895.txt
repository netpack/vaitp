"replacing substrings with incremental characters i'm trying to replace certain substrings with a character while incrementing. for example,..input:  hello world.output: he...o wor...d...everytime a character is found it will increment the amount of characters to be outputted, i'm also supposed to do this without any arrays or arraylists...i'm stuck with how to tackle this problem, i realize i'll need a variable to count the amount of times the substring is found, but as for replacing it i don't know what to do...also, i would prefer not being given the code, i'd rather do it myself...edit: the substring doesn't have to be one character necessarily, it can be multiple characters. ie. ""he"", ""llo"", etc."
