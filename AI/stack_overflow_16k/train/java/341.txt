"cannot find symbolh(blank) i'm having an  issue with the compiler with the following message:..public class circleblank2 {.    public circleblank2(double radius) {.        this.radius = radius;.    }..    public void setradius(double radius) {.        this.radius = radius;.    }..    public void getradius() {.        return radius;.    }.}...the problem is the variables are defined within the scope of the parameters. when using this.variable = variable, the method should recognize the variable passed through to be used within the method body as a statement. ..why am i getting this error?"
