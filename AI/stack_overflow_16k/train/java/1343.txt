"is it bad style to use 'return' to break a for loop in blank? i'm doing a project with basic blank for a cs class. the project has a for loop nested inside a while loop...i am not allowed to use break as a way of ending a for loop early. i found out that return seems to have the same effect as break. is it bad style to use return as a way to break the loop?..my for loop has to check through three different statements but if it finds one that is true then it is supposed to end straight away without continuing to check the rest of the statements...i tried to put a boolean operator in the while loop that controls the for loop but that doesn't control what goes on inside the for loop until the for loop gets to the end...also does it matter if return doesn't return anything?..299/01/11.update: thanks everyone so much for your comments. i found it really helpful to read through all the debates...i spoke to my tutor and it turns out for the purposes of getting full marks, i shouldn't use return either. ..so i found the advice about setting a boolean in the 'for' loop really helpful, as i didn't know you could do that."
