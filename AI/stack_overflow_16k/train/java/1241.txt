"why p in ""int q[],p[];"" is a 2d array? following are the different ways of valid array declaration..int p[] or int []p or int[] p and suppose we write int x,y then both x and y are of type integers but when i write int []q, p[]; why compiler says that p is an 2d array..please see the code below..public class some {.    int []q, p[];.    void x() {  .        p=new int[10][3];// this is valid.        //p=new int[10];// compiler expects p as 2d array.        q=new int[10];  .    }.    public static void main(string args[]).    {..    }.}"
