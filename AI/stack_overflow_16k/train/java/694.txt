"blank, removing duplicate output from separate lines generated by nested for loops i am new to blank, and i have this program that takes a number between 1 and 10 from a user and displays the multiplication table for that number. here is the code:..import blank.util.scanner; //importing the scanner library..public class question3 {.  public static void main(string[] args){.    scanner keyb = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.print(""enter an integer between 1 and 10: "");.    int usernumber = keyb.nextint();..    while (usernumber &lt;= 0 || usernumber &gt;= 10){.      system.out.print(""enter an integer between 1 and 10: "");.      usernumber = keyb.nextint();.    }.    keyb.close();..    for (int counter = 1; counter &lt;= usernumber; counter++){.      system.out.print(counter + ""t"");.      for (int number = 2; number &lt;= usernumber; number++){.        system.out.print((counter * number) + ""t"");.      }.      system.out.println("" "");.    }.  }.}...so if the user enters 4, the output will look like:..1    2    3    4.2    4    6    8.3    6    9    12.4    8    12   16...this works. i need to take the multiplication table and remove any duplicate numbers. so if the user enters 4, the desired output will look like:..1    2    3   4.     4    6   8.          9   12.              16...how can i remove the duplicate output when it only exists in the for loop print statements? ..thanks!"
