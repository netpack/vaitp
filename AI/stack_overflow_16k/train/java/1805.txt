"how to generate random integers in a range .  possible duplicate:.  generating random number in a range with blank  .....this feels pretty silly, but i'm not sure how to create a random integer, giving it a specific range to allow. i was trying to make it generate random numbers between -1 and 1. i tried doing that, but the nextint part doesn't allow two parameters to be put within the parentheses. am i supposed to be using something different?..import blank.util.random;..public class testttterrrr {..    /**.     * @param args.     */.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        random rng = new random();.        for (int i=0;i &lt; 10; i++).        {.        int pepe = 0;.        pepe = rng.nextint(1, 1-2);.        system.out.println(pepe);.        }.    }..}"
