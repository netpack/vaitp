"asking user input for an integer in blank i'm doing a basic blank tutorial that is basically a mad libs program. the idea came up in the tutorial to try making sure a user is at least 13, but the example hard coded the age into the program. i wanted to try getting the age from the user, but at this point, my code gives me an error because a ""string cannot be converted to an integer."" looking at my code, i don't see why it's giving me this error. here is what i used:..int age = console.readline(""enter your age:  "");.  if (age &lt; 13) {.    //enter exit code.    console.printf(""sorry but you must be at least 13 to use this program.n"");.    system.exit(0);.  }...i have looked for other answers, but i didn't see any that i could discern from the specific problems they were trying to fix."
