"calling custom method of a class compiled at runtime i have a blank source code which would be compiled at runtime. .i'm compiling the source code (present as a string) and loading it to a class as below : ..blankcompiler compiler = toolprovider.getsystemblankcompiler();.        compiler.run(null, null, null, sourcefile.getpath());...        // load and instantiate compiled class..        urlclassloader classloader = urlclassloader.newinstance(new url[] { root.touri().tourl() });.        class&lt;?&gt; cls = class.forname(""takeadvantageoftmapcomponents"", true, classloader);...this class contains a method which i need to call named runjob. normally i'd do it like:..takeadvantageoftmapcomponents c  = new takeadvantageoftmapcomponents();.c.runjob(new string[]);...now this same method is present in the class which i compile at runtime. but how do i call it ?"
