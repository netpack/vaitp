"blank nullpointerexception: calling a variable from a method that receives a method in a different method so, for a lab assignment i have to make a simple password encryption algorithm, and for some reason i can't figure out how to set up my enhanced for loop..here's some basic snippets from my code:..public class charshiftcrypt.{.  private static char[ ] characters;.  private static stringbuilder cryptopassword = new stringbuilder( );.}...note how char[ ] characters; is declared at the class level...public static void main( string [ ] args ).{.  string password = ""hello"";..  createchararray( password );.  createcryptoarray( );.}...note how password is declared and instantiated in the main only...private static void createchararray( string words );.{.  char[] characters = words.tochararray( );.}...the purpose of this method is to turn the input string into an array of char values...private static void createcryptoarray( ).{.  int currchar = 0;..  for( char mychar: characters ).  {.    int charnumvalue = ( int ) mychar;                     // converts char value into numeric value.    charnumvalue = charnumvalue + 23;                           // shifts each char's codepoint value by 23.    char charrecastint = ( char ) charnumvalue;                  // converts the previously converted int to char.    string charstringvalue = character.tostring( charrecastint );     // converts the previously converted char to string.    cryptopassword.append( charstringvalue );.    currchar ++;.  }.}...i've provided all  my code for this method here, and in the enhanced for loop my variable ""characters"" only calls the instance variable for characters instead, therefore giving me the nullpointerexception. it is also important to note that i'm not allowed to change anything in the main method...how can i go about fixing this?"
