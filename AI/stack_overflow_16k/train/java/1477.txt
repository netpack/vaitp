"how to use bitshift operator in blank i am trying to get the first 4 bits of a byte number, as another number. so i wrote something like this: ..byte b = (byte)0xf4;.byte b1 = b &gt;&gt;&gt; 4;...why is the second statement not allowed in blank?..edit:..i made changes as written in answer, it is leads to answer 0xff, but 0x0f was expected;..then i tried to present values in binary and noticed:..system.out.println(integer.tobinarystring(0xf1));.system.out.println(integer.tobinarystring((byte)0xf1));.system.out.println(integer.tobinarystring((byte)0xf1 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4));.system.out.println(integer.tobinarystring(0xf1 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4));...output:..11110001.11111111111111111111111111110001.11111111111111111111111111111111.1111...it is simply that 0xf1 and (byte)0xf1 are different numbers. and operator (>>>) in one case add zeroes and units in other...so i need to assign 0xf4 to byte b (which is signed), like it is unsigned byte, then make bit shift and receive 0x0f as result."
