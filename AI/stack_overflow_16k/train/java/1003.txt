"splitting an array and counting values i'm trying to figure out how to implement a method that does the following:..the method takes in a text file and counts the number of words up until a specified character ""#""...an array is passed as a parameter through the method, this contains a list of sequential numbers. a number in an array corresponds to the position the word occurs in the text file (disregarding #'s) so the 4th word will correspond to a value of 3 (n-1)...the method will count the number of times the word before a # occurs in the array and divide it by the total number of entries between #'s it will then take the average of each time this is done...so an example to make this clear:..say you have the text file containing :..hi my name # is something #..a corresponding array would be:..0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,4,4 (a number for each letter in sequence)..the first hash would occur between the 2 and 3. so the 2's represent the word occuring before the #.  so we would  calculate (total number of 2's)/total number of 0's, 1's and 2's.  this would be 4/9...we would then calculate the same between the two hashes # is something #. 'something' corresponds to a 4, so we would have (total number of 4's)/total number of 3 and 4's..this would be 2/3...we would then take the average of 2/3 and 4/9..i hope this is clear, let me know if you need any clarifications."
