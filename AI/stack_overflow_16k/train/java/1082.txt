"split string based on the string and patterns - updated string prop=""as=ap:bs=bp:cs=cs:ds=dps:"";.string currentvalue=""as""...i have the above string value(prop), i want to split the string based on the string value(currentvalue) and print the value between the equal and colon sign..so i have used the below code to achieve this, but its failing in for the last string value ""dsp"" since it's length is 3 ..system.out.println(prop.substring((prop.indexof(geo)+3), (prop.indexof(geo)+5)));..i'm an unix engineer used awk to achive this in a unix script, is there any way to achieve this as a one liner in blank?..update : the below code is working fine but its failing when both values are equal, like as=as:bs=bs:cs=cp:ds=dps: when currentvalue is as/bs its failing.string substr=prop.split(currentvalue)[1]; .system.out.println(substr.substring(substr.indexof(""="")+1,substr.indexof("":"")));"
