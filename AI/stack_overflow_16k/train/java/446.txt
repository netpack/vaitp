"restart simple blank game here is a simple blank number guessing game...after the game has finished i would like to ask the user whether he wants to play again like: do you want to play again? (answer with y/n) if the user inputs y the game will restart and random a new number, if he reply with 'n ' the game will end. here's my code :..import static blank.lang.math.*;.import blank.util.scanner;...public class homeworkloopgame1 {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        system.out.print(""welcome to number guessing game !n"");.        system.out.println(""guess a number range from 1 to 100, you have 5 guess to win this game"");.        int answer = (int) (random()*100);.        scanner guess1 = new scanner (system.in);.        system.out.println(""to begin please input your number"");.        int num1 = guess1.nextint();.        if (num1&lt;answer) {.            system.out.print(num1);.            system.out.print("" your answer is too smalln"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your second guess"");            .        }.        else if (num1&gt;answer){.            system.out.println(num1);.            system.out.print(""your answer is too bign"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your second guess"");.        }.        else {.            system.out.println(""congratulation! your answer is correct! you win !"");.        }..        int num2 = guess1.nextint();.        if (num2&lt;answer) {.            system.out.print(num2);.            system.out.print("" your answer is too smalln"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your third guess"");.        }.        else if (num2&gt;answer){.            system.out.println(num2);.            system.out.print(""your answer is too bign"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your third guess"");.        }.        else {.            system.out.println(""congratulation! your answer is correct! you win !"");.        }..        int num3 = guess1.nextint();.        if (num3&lt;answer) {.            system.out.print(num3);.            system.out.print("" your answer is too smalln"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your fourth guess"");.        }.        else if (num3&gt;answer){.            system.out.println(num3);.            system.out.print(""your answer is too bign"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your fourth guess"");.        }.        else {.            system.out.println(""congratulation! your answer is correct! you win !"");.        }..        int num4 = guess1.nextint();.        if (num4&lt;answer) {.            system.out.print(num4);.            system.out.print("" your answer is too smalln"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your final guess"");.        }.        else if (num4&gt;answer){.            system.out.println(num4);.            system.out.print(""your answer is too bign"");.            system.out.println(""try again! please input your final guess"");.        }.        else {.            system.out.println(""congratulation! your answer is correct! you win !"");.        }..        int num5= guess1.nextint();.        if (num5&lt;answer) {.            system.out.print(num5);.            system.out.print("" your answer is too smalln"");.            system.out.println(""game over"");.        }.        else if (num5&gt;answer){.            system.out.println(num5);.            system.out.print(""your answer is too bign"");.            system.out.println(""game over"");.        }.        else {.            system.out.println(""congratulation! your answer is correct! you win !"");.        }..        system.out.println(""correct answer is ""+ answer);.        scanner userreply = new scanner (system.in);.        char reply;.        system.out.println(""do you want to play again? answer with y/n)"");.    }.}"
