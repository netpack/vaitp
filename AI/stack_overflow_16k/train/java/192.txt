how to get next item in for loop i am trying to get the next item in an arraylist. i have a list of strings that i am trying to get the next item and if the next item does not exist it sets it to the last item (i already got the last item)..for (int i = 0; i &lt; stops.size(); i++) {. string stop = stops.get(i);. optional&lt;string&gt; nextstop = (stops.size() &gt; i) ? optional.of(stops.get(i + 1)) : laststop;...is what i have tried but for some reason it is throwing the index out of bounds exception..i would expect it to get the next item if the list has more items than the current but it fails due to an out of bounds exception.
