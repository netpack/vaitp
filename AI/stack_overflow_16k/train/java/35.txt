"open a program within your blank application i think the correct term is ""piping"" but i hope someone will confirm/correct this...essentially, i would like to set my program to open up a file in a plotting program or text editor to be viewed (so i don't have to type it into the command line)...is there a nice way of doing this? i have only opened and closed files so far so i am not sure where to start with opening them in a program."
