"resource leak input is never closed - where/when do i close and how? i tried closing it but i'm not sure where to put the input.close();, im really new to all this and asking my professors risks me losing points. also i'm not sure if i should keep the second to last system.out monthly payment is, or get rid of it. does it even make sense with the rest of my code?..import blank.util.scanner;.public class project2 {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        // todo auto-generated method stub.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        //yearly interest rate.        system.out.print(""enter annual interest rate, for example 0.5, no percent sign:"");.        double annualinterestrate = input.nextdouble();..        //monthly interest rate.        double monthlyinterestrate = annualinterestrate / 1200;..        //number of years.        system.out.print(""enter number of years, for example 5: "");.        int numberofyears = input.nextint() ;..        //loan amount.        system.out.print(""enter investment amount, for example 145000.95: "");.        double loanamount = input.nextdouble();..        //calculate payments.        double monthlypayment = loanamount * monthlyinterestrate / (1.                - 1 / math.pow(1 + monthlyinterestrate, numberofyears * 12));.        double totalpayment = monthlypayment * numberofyears * 12;..        system.out.println(""the monthly payment is "" + .        (int) (monthlypayment * 100) / 100.0);..        system.out.println(""accumulated value is "" +.        (int) (totalpayment * 100) / 100.0);"
