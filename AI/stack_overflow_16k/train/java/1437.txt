"positive and negative numbers in string i have to make a program that allows the user to enter integer numbers until he press '0'. the program has to print:.1)the total number of the entered numbers.2) the number of the positive ones.3) the average of the positive ones.4) the number of the negative ones.5) the sum of the negatives..so far, all i could do is make the ""enter untill '0' is pressed"" and find the number of the entered numbers, which is a lot for me and my programing skills. i am having troubles trying to find out if the number is positive or negative. probably i am not comparing them right, so i would love if i get a little help from someone advanced...here's my code so far:..import blank.io.*; ..class nums { .  public static void main(string args[])  .    throws ioexception .  { .    bufferedreader br = new bufferedreader(new .                            inputstreamreader(system.in)); .    string str;.    int enterednumbers = -1;.    int positive = 0;.    int negative = 0;.    int negativesum = 0;.    double averagepositive = 0;..    system.out.println(""enter '0' to quit.""); .    system.out.println(""enter numbers: ""); .    do { .      enterednumbers++;.      str = br.readline();..    } while(!str.equals(""0"")); .      system.out.println(""you have have entered ""+enterednumbers+ "" numbers!"");.      system.out.println(""you have have entered ""+positive+ "" positive numbers!"");.      system.out.println(""the average of the positive numebers is ""+averagepositive+ ""!"");.      system.out.println(""you have have entered ""+negative+ "" negative numbers!"");.      system.out.println(""the sum of the negative numbers is ""+negativesum+ ""!"");.  } .}"
