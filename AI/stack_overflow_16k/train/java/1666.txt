"how do i use nested for loop in this question? (without arrays) the question is from the nested for loops chapter, so i assume that i should use nested for loops for this.  ..in an entrance examination, students have answered english, maths and science papers. write a program to calculate and display average marks obtained by all the students. take number of students appeared and marks obtained in all three subjects by every student along with the name as inputs...and this is my code:..import blank.io.*;.class average.{.public static void main(string args[]) throws ioexception.{.    inputstreamreader read = new inputstreamreader(system.in);.    bufferedreader in = new bufferedreader(read);.    int i,j,m,s,e,sum;.    string name;.    double a;.    system.out.println(""enter number of students that appeared"");.    int n = integer.parseint(in.readline());.    for(i=1;i&lt;=n;i++).    {.        system.out.println(""enter name"");.        name = in.readline();.        system.out.println(""enter marks obtained in english"");.        e = integer.parseint(in.readline());.        system.out.println(""enter marks obtained in maths"");.        m = integer.parseint(in.readline());.        system.out.println(""enter marks obtained in science"");.        s = integer.parseint(in.readline());.        sum = e + m + s;.        a = sum/3.0;.        system.out.println(""average marks = ""+a);.    }.}.}...so how do i exactly use nested for loop with this? have i misunderstood the question? if so, then what should i do?"
