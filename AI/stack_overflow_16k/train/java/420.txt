"how to replace if-else block using polymorphism i am making a network application. here is the problem:..i have a messenger class. the messenger has several module classes named modulea,b,c etc..the messenger sends messagepacks (to other messengers). each messagepack has a module destination meaning once it reaches messenger it is forwarded to the correct module(a,b,c etc)...at the moment in order to forward to the correct module i'm using an if-else checking for a tag on messagepack to decide where to forward...what i would like to do is have messagepack subclasses instead of using tags(tags are strings).so typeamessage goes to modulea etc. the only way i can think to do that is having an instance of messenger in the messagepack and call a method like this: messenger.fowardtomodulea(this); but it doesn't make sense(and probably causes problems) to have an instance of messenger on messagepack...can anyone think of a way to complete the task i want without using the if-else checking for tag strings and preferably using messagepack subclasses?"
