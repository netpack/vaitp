"regular expression for characters , i need to ask you something, about my problem.try to imagine, that a have a string like:.""23221323,213213,123213,,,""..i have been looking in several websites, but i dont find anything. i need a regular expression about how to remove the character(,) ....i mean, i want to remove the last , if its more that 1:..example:..""2323,3434,2332"" ==> its ok..""3434,21321,45454,,,,==> bad. you have to remove the last 3 , only 1 final is allowed...actually i have something in blank, that works:..  string scadena=""asd,"";.            charsequence cs1 = "",,"";.            charsequence cs2 = "",,,"";.            charsequence cs0 = "","";..            if(scadena.contains(cs2)){.                scadena=scadena.substring(0, scadena.length() - 3);.            }...             else if (scadena.contains(cs1)){.                scadena=scadena.substring(0, scadena.length() - 2);.            }...             else if  (scadena.contains(cs0)){.                scadena=scadena.substring(0, scadena.length() - 1);.            }....}       ...but i want to make a regular expression to avoid this, because if the user enter a lot of (,), i have to implement more if to control this......any ideas??"
