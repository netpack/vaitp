where do i find the latest openjdk 8 ga build windows 10? i'm trying to located the openjdk 8 ga build. when i navigate to https://openjdk.blank.net/ a link is provided to https://jdk.blank.net/11/ for the newest openjdk11 build. once i arrive at jdk.blank.net/11 on the left nav bar there is a link to jdk 8. the problem i'm seeing is version 8 is an ea build. where do i find the latest ga build for windows?
