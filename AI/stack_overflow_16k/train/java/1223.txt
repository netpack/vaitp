"truncating a blank stack i have a stack&lt;string&gt; defined in blank that i use for navigation through a workflow. ..what i would like to do is ensure that all values in the stack are unique: when a transition to a ""previous"" state occurs, i want to remove everything off the stack after the first occurrence of the previous state in the stack...is there an easy way to do this?..edit: more information was requested. here's an example of the contents of a stack:..[state2, state3, state2, state1, startstate]...i need the ability to accept a string, check the stack and see if there are multiple occurrences of it, then pop elements until the ""bottommost"" occurrence of that string. ""truncate"" was probably a bad description of what i wanted to do... ""pop until i hit an arbitrary index"" is probably closer to what i need."
