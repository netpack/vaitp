"optimizing if-else /switch-case with string options what modification would bring to this piece of code? in the last lines, should i use more if-else structures, instead of ""if-if-if""..if (action.equals(""opt1"")).{.    //something.}.else.{.    if (action.equals(""opt2"")).    {.        //something.    }.    else.    {.        if ((action.equals(""opt3"")) || (action.equals(""opt4""))).        {.            //something.        }.        if (action.equals(""opt5"")).        {.            //something.        }.        if (action.equals(""opt6"")).        {.            //something.        }.    }.}...later edit: this is blank. i don't think that switch-case structure will work with strings...later edit 2: ...  a switch works with the byte, short,.  char, and int primitive data types. it.  also works with enumerated types.  (discussed in classes and inheritance).  and a few special classes that ""wrap"".  certain primitive types: character,.  byte, short, and integer  (discussed.  in simple data objects )."
