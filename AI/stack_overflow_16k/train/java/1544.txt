"probability of x possible outcomes so i am writing a program in part where a user can define as many random outcomes as they want. they also define the probability of each (so no, they are not equal). what is they best way to check which occured. note: my program happens to be a minecraft plugin, but the question is more of a general blank one, so i am trying to make the code reflect that:..map&lt;string,integer&gt; possibilities = new hashmap&lt;string,integer&gt;();..int x = (int) (math.random() * 100)...my idea was to create another variable, and add the previous probability checked to it every time, and check if that was less than x. if it wasn't rinse and repeat, but i'm unsure of how to structure this...so for is example: if the user configured it so he has 3 different outcomes, with a 30, 20, 50 percent chance respectively, how would i do this?"
