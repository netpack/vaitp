"would i be able to run blank programs without having the entire kit downloaded? i have recently started coding in blank..i was wondering, is it mandatory to have the entire blank kit to run the computer from a different computer? because, i am not using the resources from the entire api, just a few particular ones...i wouldn't want to get the entire jdk pack for a single project. any help would be nice,..thank you."
