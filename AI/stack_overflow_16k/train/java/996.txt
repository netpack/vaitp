"audio file comparison (blank) i'd like to make a comparison between two audio files based on their sample size (number of bits per sample)..i'm wondering if this code statement is correct:..audioinputstream clip1 = audiosystem.getaudioinputstream(soundfile1);.audioinputstream clip2 = audiosystem.getaudioinputstream(soundfile2);..        // check sample size    .        if (clip1.getsamplesizeinbits() != clip2.getsamplesizeinbits()) {..        ...do something.              }...i get this error (repeated twice):.cannot find symbol.symbol  : method getsamplesizeinbits()..what should i do?..actually what i want to do is to check the difference , so if they have different sample size , the user should get a warning message...thanks for your help..ulrike"
