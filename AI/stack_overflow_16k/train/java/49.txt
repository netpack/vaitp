"sharing an object between two classes in blank how do i share an object between two similar classes?.for example,i would like to have two players in a game: human and computer.they will be sharing a deck class which has a variable : arraylist cardlist.the human and computer object needs to access the cardlist at the same time to draw cards during the gameplay...the cardlist arraylist is passed to either the human or computer as an argument in the constructor to add cards to their own hand arraylist.is it possible to return the changed cardlist arraylist after i have taken some cards to add to hand arraylist?..sorry if my explanation was confusing"
