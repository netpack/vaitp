blank library to create cabinet files on unix? is there a blank library to create cabinet files on unix. i don't need any compression support. i just want to create a plain cab file using blank. ..something similar to cablib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cablib/) which can only be used for reading cab files would be perfect.  ..if there is really no library can i use a feasible work around? e.g. create a zip file and somehow convert it into a cab file?
