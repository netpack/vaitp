how to set a range of possible values in blank? so i am programming a blank application that shows certain data when a value between a specific range is entered. i thus far know how to use greater than or equal to and less than or equal to operators but i don't know how to use them both together...the result i am trying to achieve is (in simple english):..if (number >= 5 but &lt;= 15) {.   a certain task will be performed..}..if someone could help me achieve this that would be fantastic..regards
