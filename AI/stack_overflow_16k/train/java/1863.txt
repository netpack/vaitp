"how do i read in an input file with a scanner or buffered reader and count all the occurences of a specific character in the input file how can i read in a file with a scanner or bufferedreader and count all of the letter ""b"" in the file? ..right now i am taking in the file with a scanner and i have an int to count up every time i run into a ""b"", as well as an int to count up in order to check the next character in the string, but it only works for the first line because, when j reaches 13 i get an out of bounds exception(the input file has 13 characters on each line, then a line break). ..while (input.hasnext() == true) {.if (input.next().charat(j) == 'b') {.b++;.}.j++;.}...i've tried splitting on whitespace, but it tells me there are zero ""b""s every time, which isn't true."
