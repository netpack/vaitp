"blank fibonacci - elapsedtime(); formula i'm working on a small project for the fibonacci algorithm...i'm using the following method to calculate the algorithm. note that elapsedtime() returns a double. ..public static void fibonaccisequence(long n1, long n2) {..    t0 = stopwatch.elapsedtime();.    system.out.print(""index: "" + index + "" -&gt; "" + n1 + ""t"");.    t1 = stopwatch.elapsedtime();.    laptime = (1000 * t1 - 1000 * t0) / 1000;.    stdout.println("" ("" + laptime + ""t "" + t1 + "")"");..    if (index == stoppingpoint) {.        return;.    }.    index++;.    fibonaccisequence(n2, n1 + n2);.}...now don't pay too much attention about the algorithm itself - it gets fixed. i only don't understand the formula for laptime. why can't it be..laptime = t1-t0;"
