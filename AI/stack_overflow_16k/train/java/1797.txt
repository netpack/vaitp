"blank assignments query case 1..byte b = 7; // why don't i need to cast 7 to byte in this case? byte b = (byte)7;.system.out.println(b);...output: 7..case 2..static void fun(byte b) {.   system.out.println(b);.}..public static void main(string []args) {.   fun(7); // compiler gives error because a cast is missing here..}...output:.compilation error: method fun(byte) is not applicable for the argument (int)...my question is: how come in case 1, 7 is implicitly cast to byte from an int, while in case 2 it is forcing the programmer to cast it explicitly?..7 is still in the range of byte...please suggest."
