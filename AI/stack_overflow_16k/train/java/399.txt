"get and verify file names in a directory - blank there are three files in the directory and i need to verify if there all from the same set. this is based on the 3 files using the same naming structure. one file is slightly different. here is an example:.      2014_umw.xxx.      2014_umw.yyy.      2014_umw_web.zzz..2014_umw is just one example. it has to work with all data sets. ..i need to check that the three files match and have the same data set. i have written code to get the file names from the directory, drop the file extension and store the file name as a string. now i need to compare the file names to see if they are equal. if they are equal the method should return true. i am having trouble figuring out how to deal with the file name that contains the _web. what is the best way to handle this issue...import blank.io.file;.import blank.io.ioexception;..import org.apache.commons.io.*;..public class verify_filename {..private static void getallfiles(file curdir) throws ioexception{..    file[] fileslist = curdir.listfiles();.    for(file f: fileslist){.        if(f.isfile()){.            string file = fileutils.readfiletostring(f);.            filenameutils.removeextension(file);..            string [] filewithoutextension = new string [fileslist.length];.            for(int i = 0; i &lt; fileslist.length; i++){.                filewithoutextension[i] = file;                 .            }..        }..    }..}..public static boolean comparefilenames(string [] f){....}...}"
