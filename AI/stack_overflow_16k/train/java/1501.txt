"raise to the power of a number (iterative method) .  we wrote a recursive version of power, which takes a double x and an integer n and returns x^n. now write an iterative method to perform the same calculation....how do i calculate the power of the numbers? my code keeps printing the results over and over again, and i'm not sure why...public class seventhree {.    public static void main(string[] args){.        scanner in= new scanner(system.in);.        int x;.        int n;..        system.out.print(""type in a base:  "");.        x= in.nextint();..        system.out.print(""type in an exponent: "");.        n= in.nextint();..        while(n&gt;=2){.            system.out.println((x)*(n));.            system.out.println();.        }.    }.}"
