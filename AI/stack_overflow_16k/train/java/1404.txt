"how to get the average of one specific column in a 2d array? the user enters the values into the array then i'd want to get the average of any specific column...this is the code below:..public class test2dprocess {..    public static void main( string[] args ) {..        int[][] gradesarray = new int [4][3];.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i++) {.            for (int j=0; j&lt;3; j++){.                system.out.println(""enter grade: "");.                gradesarray [i][j] = input.nextint();.            } .        }.    }.}...now let's say i want to sum up the values in the first column of this array then get the average...this would mean the values in positions (0,0)...(1,0)...(2,0)...(3,0) and (4,0) of the array. how would i go about doing so?"
