"blank library inspector? i am currently working on a mantenance project that is written in blank. we are currently working to clean up the code some and try to provide a little more organization to the project overall...the list of libraries that are included in the build have grown long, and honestly no one remains that knows/remembers what each library is used for or why? so i am looking for a tool that would be able to essentially find where the library is used in the code. essentially like a find usage function in an ide has for functions. ..does such a tool exist? i am curently using netbeans and as mentioned our code is in blank...i know i could remove each library and compile the project for each library to find the usages, but it just seems there should be a better way. any ideas?"
