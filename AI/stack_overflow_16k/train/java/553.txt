"how do i find out how many times each character of a string 's' repeats itself i have searched and found some similar questions, but just can't seem to figure out how to apply them to my problem.  please bear with me, as this is my first post on the site...i have to find out how many times a character of a string repeats itself.  for example, if given ""launch at noon"", the method should print:..""l"" appears once in ""launch at noon""..""a"" appears twice in ""launch at noon""..""u"" appears once in "" launch at noon ""..""n"" appears 3 times in ""launch at noon""..""c"" appears once in ""launch at noon""..""h"" appears once in ""launch at noon"".."" "" appears twice in ""launch at noon""..""t"" appears once in ""launch at noon""..""o"" appears twice in ""launch at noon""."
