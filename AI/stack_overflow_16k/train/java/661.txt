"how do i implement a reset for my loop counter? i have an action listener that calls some methods and one of those methods counts the number of times that a loop inside of another method is run. the problem i am having is that the counter just adds to itself (i understand why i just don't know how to fix it) rather than resetting back to 0. ..here is my action listener code...    public double computeiterative(double n) throws invalidinput {            .        int a=1, b=2;.        int result = 0;.        if (n&gt;=0) {.            if(n==0)return 0;.            if(n==1)return 1;.            if(n==2)return 2;.            for(int i = 3; i &lt;= n; i++) {                    .                result = a+(2*b);.                a=b;.                b = result;                    .                this.getefficiency();                    .            }                .        }   else{.                throw new invalidinput();.        }.        return result;.    }...actionlistener that calls methods and sets text:..    public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {.        int n = integer.parseint(nfield.gettext());.        //try catch for iterate radio button.        if (iteratebtn.isselected()){.            try {                .            double result = sequence.computeiterative(n);.    int efficiency = sequence.getefficiency();.            rfield.settext(double.tostring(result));.            efield.settext(integer.tostring(efficiency));.            }.            catch (invalidinput ex) {.            }.        }...the getefficiency method counts how many times the loop inside computeiterative method is run and then sets it to a textfield...here is my getefficiency method:..    public int getefficiency() {.        efficiency++;            .        return efficiency;.    }...now obviously this will just keep adding onto itself, and i am sure that i am looking way too hard for a solution but i just cant figure it out...basically, after the try, catch, i need to set efficiency to 0 so that the next time the computeiterative(n) method is called, i get a proper reading."
