how to properly separate production and mockup class i have gps reader class which delivers coordinates from a gps receiver. this works on machines with real receivers obviously. now i created a mockup class which randomly gives me coordinates so i can start my application and see if everything works without having to deploy it to another machine...now this is the structure:..class abstractgpsreader {.}..class realgpsreader extends abstractgpsreader {.}..class fakegpsreader extends abstractgpsreader {.}..class someotherclass {.    private abstractgpsreader gpsreader = new realgpsreader();.}...to be able to test the application i have to replace..new realgpsreader()...with..new fakegpsreader()...is there a more elegant way? .can i prevent someone from using this class in production?
