"file layout exception i'm writing a blank application that can open and edit files. but i want it to give me an error if the layout of the file isnt as it should be..my file looks like this:..title.x y.name.x times line...if looked into try and catch but that doesnt give me the right solution to give an error like:..""there is no x or y specified""...or..""there is nog title in this file""...whats the option to do this?"
