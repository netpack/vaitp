"how to overflow the heap? i know that object references are created on the stack, and the objects themselves are created on the heap. in the code below, i try to fill the heap by creating a large number of main objects, using recursion in the constructor; however, instead of an outofmemoryerror, i get a stackoverflowerror..public class main {. public main() {.     new main();.}..public static void main(string[] args) {.    new main();.}.}...why does this happen?"
