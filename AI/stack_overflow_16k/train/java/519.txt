"multiple versions in a web application: duplication or messy code? i was used to manage versions with a tag in git. but that was a long time ago, for stand-alone applications. now the problem is that i have a web application, and at the same application might connect clients that expect to communicate to different versions of the application...so, i added to the input a path variable for the version in that way :..@pathparam(""version"") string version...and the client can specify the version in the url:..https://whatever.com/v.2/show...then across the code i added conditions like this:..if(version.equals(""v.2"") {.    // do something.}.else if(version.equals(""v.3"") {.    // do something else.}.else {.    // or something different.}...the problem is that my code is becoming very messy. so i decided to do in a different way. i added this condition only in one point of the code, and from there i call different classes according to the version:..myclassversion2.blank.myclassversion3.blank.myclassversion4.blank...the problem now is that i have a lot of duplication...and i want to solve this problem as well. how can i do now to have a web application that:..1) deal with multiple versions.2) it is not messy (with a lot of conditions).3) doesn't have much duplication"
