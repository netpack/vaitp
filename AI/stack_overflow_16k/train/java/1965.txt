"long json request from pojo class having too many fields i want to know how to create a long json request from pojo classes and maintain code quality? .i have around 34 classes and i have to create a json request using it. my class having around 30 private fields with getters and setters. ..i used objectmapper to create json, but i want to know how to maintain the setter of different classes? ..example ..class a{               . private int a1;. private int a2;. private int an;    . private b b;.}..class b{   . private int b1;. private int b2;. private int bn;    . private c c;.}    ..i did code like below for above class..    a a =new a();.    a.seta1();.    a.seta2();.    a.seta3();.    a.setan();..    b b=new b();.    b.setb1();.    b.setb2();.    b.setb3();.    b.setbn();.    a.setb(b);..    objectmapper obj = new objectmapper();.    string jsonstr = obj.writevalueasstring(request);.    system.out.println(jsonstr);...is it correct wary or how can i remove the setter part from the main code and manage another location?"
