"pass new object with the use of setter in method parameters i'm trying to pass new object as method parameter and set it's variable at the same time...this an okay solution but big and not nice.....eventbox evtbox = new eventbox();.evtbox.setfloorcolor(floorcolor);.scriptutils.runscript(""sc-cfrmd"",evtbox);...and i need something like this to shorten it up a bit..scriptutils.runscript(""sc-cfrmd"",new eventbox().setfloorcolor(floorcolor)); ...of course, logical way of doing this is just creating a constructor in eventbox class but i need to figure out way without use of constructors...any tips are appreciated"
