"design huge integer class i am designing a class called hugeinteger - which uses 40 element array of digits to store integers. i am providing a method called parse in which it receive a string, extract each digit as shown in the snippet below. also i am providing method add which it receives an object of class hugeinteger to do the addition..the method provided for the add is not working as proposed and i would like you if you could help me in a solution..p.s i noticed some similar questions asked before but it did not help me...private int [] integerdigits = new int[size];..//constructor that enables an object of class to be initialised when it is declared.    public hugeinteger(string stringofintegers).    {.        setofintegers = stringofintegers;.    }//end of constructor..private int[] parsefunction (string str).    {.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; str.length(); i++).        {.            char ch = str.charat(i);.            if (character.isdigit(ch)).                integerdigits[i] = character.getnumericvalue(ch);.            else.                    integerdigits[i] = 0;.        }   .                return integerdigits;.        }//end of method parsefunction..    public hugeinteger addfunction(hugeinteger number).        {.            parsefunction(setofintegers);.            return new hugeinteger(setofintegers +number.parsefunction(setofintegers));.        }//end of method addfunction"
