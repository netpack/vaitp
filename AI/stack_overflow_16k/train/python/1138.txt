"how to make blank script portable to machines with interpreters in different locations? i'm sure this is well documented somewhere, but i can't find it! i want to make my scripts portable to machines that may not have their blank interpreters in the same location. for that reason, i thought that i could just code the first line as #!blank3 rather than with the absolute path to the interpreter, like #!/usr/local/bin/blank3...no doubt most of you understand why this doesn't work, but i have no idea. although my lab mates aren't complaining about having to recode my scripts to reflect the absolute path to the interpreter on their own machines, this seems like it shouldn't be necessary. i'd be perfectly happy with a response providing a link to the appropriate documentation. thanks in advance."
