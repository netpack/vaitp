"repeated mode selection i wrote program which begins with mode selection and it should prompt this selection every time when one mode is completed. the code is following:..def get_mode():.    mode=raw_input('welcome to learning helpmate beta. select mode, insert number of wanted mode: n 1.mode n 2.mode n 3.moden').    return mode..mode=get_mode()..if mode =='1':.    print 'welcome to mode 1'.    mode=get_mode()..if mode =='2':.    print 'welcome to mode 2'.    mode=get_mode()..if mode =='3':.    print 'welcome to mode 3'.    mode=get_mode()...my problem is that when i select certain mode and run it and then try to select same mode again, my program ends and nothing will happen. how could i fix this problem without overwriting existing code too much?..thank you"
