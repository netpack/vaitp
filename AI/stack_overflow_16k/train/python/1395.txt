"is it possible to write a program in blank that takes info from a document scanner and sends it to something like the peachtree accounting software? i'm trying to make my company's accounts payable system a little more automated and am wondering if i could write a program in blank that takes information (e.g. invoice number, date, company name) from a scanned document or pdf and then sends it to peachtree accounting.  the goal is to reduce the amount of data entry and simply scan the hard copies of the invoices, get the info that is currently manually entered, and place it in the appropriate spot in peachtree.  i know this may be a shot in the dark but any help at all would be appreciated."
