i cannot loop through a string in a function i want to create a function that can take a positive integer n as input and return the sum of all that number's digit...below is my code:..def digit_sum(n): .    string = str(n) .    for number in string: .        num = int(number) .        total = 0  .        total += num  .    return total...but the error message is :.your function fails on digit_sum(434). it returns 4 when it should return 11...to my knowledge is that the for loop doesn't loop successfully. it only loops one time then return the value...my questions are:...what' wrong with my code?.the reason i need to convert the number into string first is that integer cannot iterable?...hope anyone could help me out..thanks!!
