"shortening my 'and/or' code using parentheses i want to shorten this code:..if (a+b+c == 1000 and a**2 + b**2 == c**2) or (a+b+c == 1000 and a**2 + c**2 == b**2) or (a+b+c == 1000 and b**2 + c**2 == a**2)...into:..if a+b+c == 1000 and (a**2 + b**2 == c**2 or a**2 + c**2 == b**2 or b**2 + c**2 == a**2)...or to be more simple:..(a and b) or (a and c) or (a and d) &lt;=&gt; a and (b or c or d)...is this reasonable? it seems to work when i run the code, but i'm not sure it's the proper way. is there a better way to shorten this?"
