"filter for file extensions using os.walk but with restrictions on file name i am using os.walk to iterate through a directory and want to count the number of lines i have in .java files of that directory. i've found from other answers that i can use fnmatch.filter to only get .java files like this:..for (root, dirs, files) in os.walk(project_directory):.        for file in fnmatch.filter(files, '*.java'):.            # get line count...however, i want to exclude a few files that have a specific name, say myexclusion.java. how can i enhance the filter the avoid searching these files? the best i can figure out is to add another conditional:..for (root, dirs, files) in os.walk(project_directory):.        for file in fnmatch.filter(files, '*.java'):.            if file != 'myexclusion.java':.                # get line count...can fnmatch.filter be used to do this, or am i forced to add a conditional check here?"
