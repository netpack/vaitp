"what would be the missing step in the accumulator for this program? so i've been assigned to write a program in blank that prompts the user to type a word, then deletes letters from the word in sequence. the first letter in the first line, the second in the second, etc. ..for example, for ""atlanta"":..tlanta.alanta.atanta.atlnta.atlata.atlana.atlant...this is what i've got and semantically, it's not doing anywhere close to what i want.! i guess it's clear the problem lies in the first and second lines of the for loop. i'm not sure what to do."
