"why isn't my blank code seeing the condition? my blank code isn't working. i have tried many ways of doing it but i can't seem to make this work. could anyone tell me what's wrong?..if not dead:.   time.sleep(2).   print('').   print('""ok next question."" she looked at a paper in front of her.').   time.sleep(2).   print('""where on earth do they a day with 24 hours and a night with 24 hours?""').   time.sleep(2).if ally:.   print('').   print('""small hint, it starts with a and is a cold desert.""').   print('').   answer = input('which place?:'). else:.   answer = input('which place?:').   if answer == 'antarctica' or answer == 'antarctica':.      time.sleep(2).      print('').      print('she nods. ""correct. two more.').   if answer != 'antarctica' and answer != 'antarctica' and ally:.      time.sleep(2).      print('').      print('shaking her head with wide eyes, she looks around carefully.').      time.sleep(2).      print('""the answer is antarctica."" she says, mimicking your voice.').      dead = false.      time.sleep(2).      print(''""i can't do that much, so please try to refrain from getting it wrong.""'').   if answer != 'antarctica' and answer != 'antarctica' and not ally:.      time.sleep(2).      print('').      print('she sighs. '""i'm sorry.""' the fire below comes closer and closer as you fall.').      dead = true...the code just seems to end if i put in a wrong answer, whereas i would like it to see that if the user has an ally, it will give out a different answer, if they don't have an ally they give a different answer etc. .any help would be highly appreciated!"
