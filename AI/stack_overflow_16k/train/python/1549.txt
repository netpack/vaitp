"list comprehension - blank i'm trying iterate over lists in blank, but can't do it in an economic and blankic way...i can do in one dimension list:..api_time = ['hour', 'time']..text = 'what time is it?'.request = [r for r in api_time if r in text]...this outputs 'time', which is correct...but when i start using two dimension list, i can't do it in one sentence...api_time = ['hour', 'time'].api_weather = ['clime', 'rain']..apis = [api_time, api_weather]...how can i check this in one sentence?"
