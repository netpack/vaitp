"blank, extracting 3 lines before and after a match i am trying to figure out how to extract 3 lines before and after a matched word. ..at the moment, my word is found. i wrote up some text to test my code. and, i figured out how to print three lines after my match...but, i am having difficulty trying to figure out how to print three lines before the word, ""secure""...here is what i have so far:..from itertools import islice.with open(""testdoc.txt"", ""r"") as f:.for line in f:.    if ""secure"" in line:.        print("""".join(line)).        print ("""".join(islice(f,3)))...here is the text i created for testing:..----------------------------. this is a test to see.if i can extract information.using this code.i hope, i try, .maybe secure shell will save thee.im adding extra lines to see my output.hoping that it comes out correctly.boy im tired, sleep is nice.until then, time will suffice"
