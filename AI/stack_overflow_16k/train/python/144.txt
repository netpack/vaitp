"print user inputted number with commas and the numbers in between i'm new to blank and trying to code a simple script...what i want the script to do is ask the user for the first number, then asks for the second number, then prints out both of these numbers including the numbers in between and add commas...for example:.lets say the user inputted the number 2 as the first number.then inputs 10 as the second number.the script will print out this: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10..this is my code:..number_1 = int(raw_input(""input first number:""));.number_2 = int(raw_input(""input second number:""));.print"
