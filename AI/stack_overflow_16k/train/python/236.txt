"finding 1000 linear interpolated values between every number of a list in blank i am a beginner in blank and am stuck on a problem. i have two lists of 60 floating point numbers, lets call them start and end. the numbers in both the lists are not in an increasing or decreasing order...start = [ ] //60 floating point numbers.end = [ ] // 60 floating numbers...i would like to find 1000 interpolated values between start[0] and end[0] and repeat the process for all 60 values of list. how do i go about it?"
