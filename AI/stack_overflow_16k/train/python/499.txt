"how do i convert integer column values to categorical or string column values dynamically in blank? i have a column that has the values 1,2,3.....i need to change this value to cluster_1, cluster_2, cluster_3... dynamically. my original table looks like below, where cluster_predicted is a column, containing integer value and i need to convert these numbers to cluster_0, cluster_1.......i have tried the below code ..clustersdf['clusterdfcategorical'] = ""cluster_"" + str(clustersdf['clusterdfcategorical'])...but this is giving me a very weird output as shown below."
