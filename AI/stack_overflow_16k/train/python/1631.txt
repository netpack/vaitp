"function to check a point is on a straight line i have the coordinates of a point pos = (x, y), and i need to check if it is a part of a straight line which passes trought two points p1 = (x1, y1), p2 = (x2, y2)..the formula that i'm using is y - y1 = ((x - x1)/(x2 - x1)) * (y2 - y1), and the code is:..        if pos[1] - p1[1] - 10 &lt;= ((pos[0] - p1[0]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])) * (p2[1] - p1[1]) &lt;= pos[1] - p1[1] + 10:.            return true...while i was testing it, i noticed that the straight line the slope is the opposite....i got this by check every point of the canvas (using tkinter):..    p1 = (313, 215).    p2 = (92, 44)..    for x in range(0, 400):.        for y in range(0, 300):.            if y - p1[1] - 5 &lt;= ((x - p1[0]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])) * (p2[1] - p1[1]) &lt;= y - p1[1] + 5:.                canvas.create_oval(x, y, x, y)...the biggest one is the line which is represented by the equation above, the hand drawn one is what i want...i tried also to test it on geogebra, but there all works properly...what am i missimg?"
