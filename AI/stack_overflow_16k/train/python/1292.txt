"how to reference one classes variable to another class for manipulation? i have two classes, an ""items"" class and a ""player"" class....player has ""health"" and ""mana"".the item class needs to change the players health or mana (depending on how it is defined), while retaining data of its own....basically, i want to make a method within the item class that activates the item to change the players health...an idea of what i want my code to do, but have no idea how to:..class player:.    def __init__(self,health,mana):.        self.health = health.        self.mana = mana..class item:.    def __init__(self,classtoeffect, effectvariable, effectamount ):.        self.classtoeffect = player.        self.effectvariable = effectvariable.        self.effectamount = effectamount..    def use(self):.        self.classtoeffect.__dict__[self.effectvariable] += effectamount..p1 = player(100,100).i1 = item(p1,'health',10)..print(p1.health) # should print 100.i1.use() # should increase p1.health by 10.print(p1.health) # should print 110...when this is run i get a keyerror for 'health'."
