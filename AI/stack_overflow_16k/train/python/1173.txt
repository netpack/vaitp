"assigning 2d array in vector of indices given 2d array k = np.zeros((m, n)) and list of indices in the range 0, 1 .., m-1 of size n called places = np.random.random_integers(0, m-1, n) how do i assign 1 in each column of k in the places[i] index where i is running index..i would like to achieve that in blank compact style and without any loops..examples:..n = 5, m =3.places= 0, 0, 1, 1, 2...then:..k = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0.     0, 0, 1, 1, 0.     0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
