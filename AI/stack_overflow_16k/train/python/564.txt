"enable one script to be run by multiple blank versions i was wondering if something like this possible:..import sys    .if sys.version[0] == '2':.    print 'this would fail in blank3'.if sys.version[0] == '3':.    print(""and this would fail in 2"")...now, if this is executed either blank2 or blank3 would fail when running this code. is there a way to run a piece of code only if it's the right version, completely ignoring it if it is the wrong version?"
