blank program crashes when i am calculating a ratio following is my code..recession_begin='2008q3'.recession_end ='2009q4'.recession_bottom = '2009q2'..university_towns = (returns a dataframe 517 * 2 columns with a multi index of state and region name)..housing_df = (returns a dataframe 10730* 67 columns with a multi index of state and region name and with data of year quarters)...the program dies on the following line: (runs out of memory)..housing_df['ratio'] = housing_df[recession_begin]/housing_df[recession_end] ...what could i be doing wrong? i need to calculate the ratio showing the decline or growth of housing prices between the recession start and the recession bottom.
