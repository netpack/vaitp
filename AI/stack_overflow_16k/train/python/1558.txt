"blank program returns empty list i've recently took up blank programming and i've written a simple function that takes two lists and returns a new one that does a reunion of the two lists. however when i run the code it returns an empty list. please help:..x = [1, 2, 3].y = [4, 5, 6]...def reunion(list_of_numbers1,list_of_numbers2):.    union_list = list().    for i in range(0,len(list_of_numbers1)):.        if list_of_numbers1[i] in list_of_numbers2 is true:.            union_list.append(i).            del list_of_numbers1[i].            del list_of_numbers2[i].    return union_list.z = reunion(x,y).print(z)"
