"blank quotation mark canceler algorithm i = 1.def textconverter(t,color='black'):.    #magically change all quotation marks (') to (').    cwprint(t,color).def cwprint(t,color='black'):.    global i.    exec('label%d = label(cw,text=''%i+t+'',fg=color).grid(row='+str(i)+')').    i += 1.textconverter('test')...i am building a small chat program to experiment with the tkinter and socket libraries, but however i ran into this problem: i want to print a value (text which is sent by the user) on the screen using a label...everything goes alright untill the user inputs a string including a quotation mark. for example: 'don't do that'..blank will think that the string is 'don' and doesn't recognise the 't do that' part..is there any way to fix this?..thanks..btw: cwprint stands for print on chat window"
