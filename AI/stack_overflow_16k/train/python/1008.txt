"one repository with two folder names i have a series of numerical computations that use blank scripts in the /src folder and they take many hours to complete...in the mean time, i would like to add more features in the folder or debug the existing files, without breaking the code that is currently running...i was thinking about creating a remote git repository and clone it to two different directories:../src/lib.py./dev/lib.py...i push from dev to remote and pull from remote to src..and in the main code main.py i have:..from lib import foo.foo()...how do i tell the release code to load the libraries from /src while the development code to load from /dev without changing the main.py code?..is there a better way (other than git) to synchronize these two folders?"
