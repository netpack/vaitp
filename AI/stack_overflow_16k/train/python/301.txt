"calling a function which has one of the parameters already assigned a value according to blank docs it is illegal to define a function as def test(a, b = 1, c): - any subsequent parameter to a parameter which has a default value (b = 1) also needs to be defined with a default value. the correct way would be def test(a, b = 1, c = 2):.can someone explain it?..edited: i think that having polymorphism in title was confusing. title has been changed to reflect the content of the question"
