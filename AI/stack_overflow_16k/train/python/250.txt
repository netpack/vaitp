"where is blank's home directory? i have blank 2.7 installed, im looking at trying tensorflow and for windows it looks like it only works on blank 3.5, i downloaded the blank installer and it is apparently installed, but where?..blank 2.7 has a blank27 directory in c:, but i cant locate 3.5 anywhere.  i tried the installer again and it asked if i wanted to repair or remove...edit: im really trying to find pip3, which i assume is in the blank35/scripts directory"
