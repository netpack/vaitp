"blank doesn't recognize -1 as false? i recently wrote a blank program that used:..if s.find('something'): ...or..if s.find('something')==true:...but nothing worked correctly until i used:..if s.find('something') &gt;0...that's the only way i could get an accurate true decision in my program...it seems -1 result wasn't recognized as false. successful finds weren't recognized as true either. so looking for -1 (false) or a positive number >0 (true) was the only thing that worked for me...what was i doing wrong? this can't be the way blank works, can it?"
