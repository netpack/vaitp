"how to fix runtime error in tic tac toe check win function i'm writing a tic-tac-toe game in blank 2 for my compsci class using simplegui. i have a 2d array set so that whenever a player clicks within a certain area on the canvas, it will draw an x or an o in that area and will also write one of the array elements to be set to that letter. that works fine. i've defined a function to check each row of the array to check if the player has won, and it looks something like this: ..def checkrows():.    if len(set(grid[0])) == 1:.        winner = grid[0][0].    if len(set(grid[1])) == 1:.        winner = grid[1][0].    if len(set(grid[2])) == 1:.        winner = grid[2][0]...additionally, i have a counter that increments by one every time a square is filled and a while loop at the end that runs the checkrows function while the counter is less than 9 (because 9 is the maximum number of squares that need to be filled for one player to win). that looks something like this:..while counter &lt; 9:.    checkrows().    if winner == ""x"":.        frame.add_label(""x wins!"", 100).    elif winner == ""o"":.        frame.add_label(""o wins!"", 100)...every time i run the code it throws a runtime error, saying ""timelimiterror: program exceeded run time limit."", sometimes on the first, sometimes on the second line of the function. does anyone know what could be the cause of this?"
