"some %r format starts and ends with a double quote instead of a single quote i have two similar blank codes...formatter = ""%r %r %r %r"".print formatter % (.    ""i had this thing"",.    ""that you could type upright"",.    ""but it didn't sing"",.    ""so i said goodnight"".).print formatter % (.    ""hi!"",.    ""my name is __!"",.    ""nice to meet you!"",.    ""thank you!"".)...other is printed as ' ', but the only third phrase is printed as ""but it didn't sing"" in the first code..why does it result in double quotes?..result : ..'i had this thing.' 'that you could type up right.' ""but it didn't sing."" 'so i said goodnight.'"
