"how do i make a module think its name is __main__? i have a blank script (actually, lots of scripts) with code that is executed only when this module is run as the main script:..if __name__ == '__main__':.    print(""i am the main script"")...but now i want a testing script to load them as modules, so that it can then poke in their internal state. rewriting (to turn the code block into a function) is not an option. how do i import a module in such a way that it thinks its name is __main__? i'm sure i've seen this done before, with the help of some import library or other, but it's not coming up in my searches."
