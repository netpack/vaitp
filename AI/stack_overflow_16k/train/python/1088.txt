"passing data between different versions of blank similar to this question:..passing data between blank scripts, while separately running..but i have two different versions of blank running (2.x and 3.x). we use 2.x in my shop, but are running 3.x on a virtual machine for machine learning libraries that 2.x doesn't support...will this solution work for 2.x and 3.x, or is there another method?"
