"problems understanding conditions in if statement blank hello i am a beginner in blank programming and  i have to write a rock paper scissor game. however the only strings that should be typed in are rock, scissor or paper. if i check them in an if statement  i have the following problem the code above keeps on giving correct as output even though i put wrong input in player1 and player2..it does not switch to the else condition...def rps():.print ""********** rock paper scissors **********""..print 'what does player 1 choose?' .player1 = raw_input().print 'what does player 2 choose?' .player2 = raw_input()..if player1 and player2 == 'rock' or 'paper' or 'scissor':.    print 'correct'..else:.    print 'this is not a valid object selection'...and the weird thing is that in some cases it actually does work?"
