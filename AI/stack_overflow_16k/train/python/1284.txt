"finding the largest number in a nested list in blank i would like to put the max number(s) to a new array, i've tried every thing that i can think of and none seem to work....(adding to an empty result array, concat, etc)..obviously the for loop is printing the max function out with the proper numbers,.but i have a weak understanding of return vs print and how to capture values from a loop , etc...list = [[21, 34, 345, 2], [555, 22, 6, 7], [94, 777, 65, 1], [23, 54, 12, 666]].for i in list:.    print max(i)..345.555.777.666"
