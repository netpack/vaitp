"create a zip file from a directory, but not his fullpath im trying to create a zipfile with the content of a folder ( some dirs and files ) using the code belllow:..import zip,os..path = ""c:\tester\foldertozip"".zip = zipfile.zipfile(""zippedfolder.zip"", ""w"").for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):.    for file in files:.        zip.write(os.path.join(root, file)).zip.close()...but after the code runs, when i check the zip file, the zip file, instead having the content of the folder ""foldertozip"" ( ex: f1,f2,f2, a.txt,b.txt,c.txt ) it have the full path of the variable path...so, the question is, how can i create a zipfile based on a folder content, but not his fullpath ?"
