read lines between empty spaces of data file and write in new files i have the big data text file for example:..#01textline1.1 2 3 4 5 6.2 3 5 6 7 3.3 5 6 7 6 4.4 6 7 8 9 9..1 2 3 6 4 7.3 5 7 7 8 4.4 6 6 7 8 5..3 4 5 6 7 8.4 6 7 8 8 9.........i want to extract data between empty lines and write it in new files. it is hard to know how many empty lines are in file (means you also dont know how many new files you will be writing ; thus it seems very hard to write new files since u dont know how many new files will you be writing. can anyone guide me? thank you. i hope my question is clear.
