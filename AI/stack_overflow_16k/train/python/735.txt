"connecting classes and assigning values i've created two classes one called offense and the other defense. i'm having trouble making it so that a user can pick the run play and when the plays go against each other the greater play wins. i believe i've done the inheritance correctly on the defense class by adding the offense class to the argument of the defense class. but after creating a rule that the offense play is less than the defense play in the defense class, nothing happens. ..here's my code:..class offense():.    def __init__(self):.        self.play1 = 'run'.off_1 = offense().....class defense(offense):.    def __init__(self):.        self.play1 = 'run'..defen_1 = defense().off_1.play1 &lt; defen_1.play1..if off_1.play1 &lt; defen_1.play1:.    print(""defense wins"")"
