"how to get progress from copying .zip files i need to copy zip files and want to get the progress printed. i have everything set so that it starts copying the file and outputs progress. the problem is that it doesn't seem to be stopping at any point. the output goes well beyond 100% and i end up killing the program...here is my code:..def copyfileobjprogress(fsrc, fdst, callback, length=16 * 1024):.    copied = 0.    max = os.path.getsize(default_folder).    print(max).    while true:.        with open(fsrc, 'rb') as s:.            with open(fdst, 'wb') as d:.                buf = s.read(length).                if not buf:.                    break..                d.write(buf).                copied += len(buf).                callback(copied, max)...def percentage(copied, max):.    print(copied / max *100)...the first does the copying and the seconds prints the output."
