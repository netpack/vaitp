"loop only works once before you mark this as duplicate, please hear me out...my code needs a lot of inputs at the terminal. it needs to process two (or more) trajectory files (.gro, separated by a comma). here is what the input at the terminal looks like:...  script -c 'blank script.py -f traj1.gro,traj2.gro -i 1 -s 30 ... (other info)' logfile.log ...inside my script, to separate the two traj files that come after the '-f' , i use this:..files = [].......for i in sys.argv[1:]:.    if i == '-f':.        file = sys.argv[sys.argv.index('-f')+1] #input filenames after -f.        for j in file.split(','):.            global files.            files.append(j)..for s in range(len(files)):.    file = ''.    print s.    print files[s].    file = files[s]..    ... (rest of the code inside this branch)...now the code is supposed to go through each traj file one at a time. ..at first, it works fine. the 1st file was processed, and it printed ""0"" and the file name. but when the processing was done, it printed:...  1.  .  traceback (most recent call last):.  .  file ""script.py"", line 462, in .  .  file = files[s].  .  indexerror: list index out of range.  .  script done, file is logfile.log...how is it out of range when the len(files) is 2 ? also it clearly printed ""1"" so we know that the for s in range(len(files)) line worked not only once but for a second time, it just didn't execute the rest of the block, and it also did not print the 2nd file name (index 1)."
