"how can i determine the method used to launch my blank script in windows? is there a way to differentiate between a .py file launched by double-clicking its icon in windows versus typing myscript.py in an existing command prompt window? my code ends with os.system(""pause"") so that i can see the results when double-clicking to launch, but that line should be ignored when running it in a persistent window."
