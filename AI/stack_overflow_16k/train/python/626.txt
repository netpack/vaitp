"alias for dictionary operation in blank i want to do something like this:..f[frozenset((1,3,4))] = 5.f[frozenset((1,))] = 3...but it's just painful to type these all the time, is there anyway to have alias for this? i know in c++ it's possible to have a helper function which return a reference so you can just type:..f(1,3,4) = 5.f(1) = 3...with f as a helper function. thanks very much!"
