"blank get all submodules without having to define __all__ my requirement might be a bit strange, but here it is:..i have a package called handlers. outside of this package, i have main.py. in main.py, i need to get all the submodules under handlers. now i can define __all__ in __init__.py but that would have to be updated everytime i add a new submodule in the directory. so is there a way to automatically keep __all__ updated?"
