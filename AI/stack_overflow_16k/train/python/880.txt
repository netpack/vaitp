"have phase not equal 0 after 2 pi if i have a list of phases for a sinusoidal data points and want to make a plot of time vs phase, the plot goes back to 0 after the data is past 2 pi. is there a way i could manipulate the data so it continues after 2 pi?.i'm currently using phase = [i % 2*np.pi for i in phase], but this doesn't work...this being about phase isn't important though. lets say i had a list of data: ..data = [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2]...but i didn't want the data to reset to 0 after 2, so i want the data to be:..data = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]"
