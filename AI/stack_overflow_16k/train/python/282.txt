"copying row from scrolled_window to clipboard i'm trying to copy content of a row being displayed from a treeview, to use in a separate editor program. i found a potential solution using tkinter and the clipboard_append() function, which seems to work within the original script, but does not modify the system clipboard and thus make the data available to the editor program. obviously i am missing something and need at least a few hints. using pyperclip seems like overkill for my needs, which are simply to lookup entries in a membership mysql database with some 24k rows and copy a single selected row into an editor program."
