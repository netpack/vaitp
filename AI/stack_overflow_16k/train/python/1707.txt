"add the same index of a list if they are similar in another specific index i'm programming in blank and have a list of lists of..a=[[1234,32.5,'john',1114],[1234,16.3,'john',1115],[1235,25.3,'john',1116],.  [1239,16.3,'lisa',1117]]...how can i merge the lists of the similar element in sub-index [0] and remove the list that contains the smallest element of index [3] ?..expected output:..a=[[1234,48.8,'john',1115],[1235,25.3,'john',1116],[1239,16.3,'lisa',1117]]...since .. a[1][3] &gt; a[0][3] (1116 &gt; 1115) ...a[0][1] will be added to a[1][1] and a[0] will be completely removed...i'm planning to use this to a list of ten thousands of lists...edit:..i''ve made:..old=[[1234,32.5,'john',1114],[1234,16.3,'john',1115],[1235,25.3,'john',1116],[1239,16.3,'lisa',1117]]..memory=old[0]..new=[]..for x, t in enumerate(old):.    if t==memory:.        new.append([t[0],memory[1]+t[1],t[2],t[3]]).        memory=t...but this would not work on lists if there are more than two lists that are similar in index [0], the code should be run again and again depending on how many similar elements are there. in application, my list of lists would have hundreds of similar elements in a specific index."
