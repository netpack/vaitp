"creating fingerprint file from flat file in blank i have another newbie blank question. i have a file as shown below. i need to convert it to vector and fingerprint like form. for me the problem is how to combine the files so in final i have the matrix where rows are cmps and columns are val... and if the val is missing for the comp then equal to zero. the vals for cmp are different and overlap is not very big. can you please suggest where to go better? blank dictionaries? any ideas help. thank's!..cmp1    0.277   val_1.cmp1    0.097   val_2.cmp1    0.795   val_3.cmp1    0.809   val_4.cmp1    0.127   val_5.cmp2    0.839   val_3.cmp2    0.909   val_4.cmp2    0.148   val_5.cmp2    0.938   val_6.cmp2    0.599   val_7...results i neen to receive......vector version..name    val_1   val_2   val_3   val_4   val_5   val_6   val_7.cmp1    0.277   0.097   0.795   0.809   0.127   0   0.cmp2    0   0   0.839   0.909   0.148   0.938   0.599   ...binary version..name    val_1   val_2   val_3   val_4   val_5   val_6   val_7.cmp1    0   0   1   1   0   0   0.cmp2    0   0   1   1   0   1   1...current code..import csv..fi = open(""data.txt"", ""rb"").fo = open(""data_out.txt"", ""wb"").reader = csv.reader(fi,delimiter='t').writer = csv.writer(fo,delimiter='t')..# making unique lists.targets = set().ligands = set()..for row in reader:.    ligands.add(row[0]).    targets.add(row[2])..data = [].for row in reader:.    if row[0] in ligands and row[2] in targets:.    else:"
