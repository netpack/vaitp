"how to check if an element exists inside a dictionary of lists? for example, if i have a dictionary ""dict"" that contains 3 lists as values : {1: ['a', 'b', 'c'], 2: ['d'], 3: ['z']}..how do i check if 'd' is an element inside any of the 3 lists inside the dictionary?..'c' in dict.values() doesn't work, which i think is because ""dict"" only contains lists as values, rather than letters."
