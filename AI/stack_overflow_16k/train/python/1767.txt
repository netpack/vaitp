"my if-else statement isn't working with the list i used so i entered 3 as my eye color (green) and it displays ""you are a optimistic person"" instead of ""you are a curious person"". why is this? isn't it supposed to display the else? ..eyelist = [""blue"", ""brown"",""green"",""hazel"",""grey"",""none""]..print(eyelist)..eyecolor = int(input(""pick your eye color: ""))..if eyecolor == 1 or 2:..  print(""you are a  optimistic person"")..else:.  print(""you are a curious person"")"
