"what does the following logic do in blank?   counts = defaultdict(int).  for currchar in records['abc'].values():.      counts[currchar] += 1.  ks = [ct for k,  ct in sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=true)]...here i am not following the last line:..1) ct for k..what does this mean? what does k stand for?.this is also the first use of variable ct and k in the code..does ct represent count? what does k represent? ..2) ct in sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=true).what is the meaning of above syntax especially key=lambda x: x[1].again the code has not declared x variable anywhere in the codebase before its use here."
