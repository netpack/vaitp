"convert string to modified digit i have the following numbers, which i want to convert:..'2.44' --&gt; '2.44'.'12.83' --&gt; '2.83'.'121.834' --&gt; '1.83'...in other words, i want 1 digit to the left of the decimal point and two digits to the right. what would be the best way to do this? my current method is using:..number = '41.33'.index = number.index('.').result = number[index-1] + '.' + number[index+1:index+3]...is there a better, cleaner way to do this?"
