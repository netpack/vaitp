"how to apply different operations to different columns of a matrix? i have a nested list as a matrix. to each column's item of it i need to apply the same operation but one of the operation's argument depends on the column, so it's variable., and is contained in a list. what should i use for that?..example:..arg_list = [1,2,3]..matrix = [[1,2,3],.          [1,3,5],.          [6,7,2],.          [1,4,2]]...result of subtraction:..matrix = [[0,0,0],.          [0,1,2],.          [5,5,-1],.          [0,2,-1]]"
