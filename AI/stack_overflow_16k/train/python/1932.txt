"blank not appending to each line in file in directory i am trying to append a string (""testing123"") to each line of every file in my current working directory (cache/configs). this is what i've done:..import os..for file in os.listdir('cache/configs'):.    with open('cache/configs/'+file, ""r"") as f:.        lines = f.readlines().        for line in lines:.            line = line+""testing123""...the command goes through without error, but nothing is changing. at face value my logic seems cogent. where am i going wrong? thanks...[blank version 3.6]"
