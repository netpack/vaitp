"set minimum length of a list? i have a list in blank. i don't know exactly how long it is, but i know it's less than 15 items long...i want to pad it out to exactly 15 items long, appending empty strings for all the items that i need to add...is there an efficient way to do this in blank? ..i was hoping:..myarr = myarr[:15]...might work, but it doesn't...currently i have:..if len(myarr) &lt; 15:.    for i in range(15 - len(myarr)):.        myarr.append('')...any more compact suggestions?"
