"how to send an email using an api in blank with an email that was received using post method in html form? i'm trying to create an html form wherein when the user inputs their email, it'll immediately execute an email being sent to them. i'm doing this through a mailgun api and a super simple html form, and whilst the form works and the code for sending the email works on its own as its own separate blank file, i can't for the life of me figure out how the two can connect. any help or direction would be greatly appreciated!..from flask import flask, render_template, request.import requests.app = flask(""myapp"")..@app.route('/').def main():.    return render_template(""emailform.html"").@app.route(""/mail"", methods=[""post""]).def sign_up():.    form_data = request.form.    print form_data[""email""].    return ""thanks""..def send_simple_message():.    return requests.post(.    ""https://api.mailgun.net/v3/sandboxurl"",.         auth=(""api"", ""myapikey""),.         data={""from"": ""excited user &lt;mailgun@sandboxurl.mailgun.org&gt;"",.            ""to"": ""email"",.            ""subject"": ""this is a subject line"",.            ""text"": ""this is the email body""}).send_simple_message().app.run(debug=true)"
