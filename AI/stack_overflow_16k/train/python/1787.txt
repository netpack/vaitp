"how to convert a text file into dictionary? from a file, i am supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a person's name, and each value is a list with three elements in this order: the person's gender, the person's age and the person's height...for example, if my file ""file.txt"" has two lines like this:..peter, male, 18, 180.andrew, male, 40, 175..then the dictionary returned by this function would be:..{""peter"": [""male"", 18, 180], ""andrew"": [""male"", 40, 175]}..i tried:..d={}.l=[].f= open(""items.txt"",""r"").for line in f:.    (key, val) = line.split("","",1).    value= val.split("","").    l.append(value).    d[key] = l.return d.f.close()    ...and it returns:.{'peter': [[' male', ' 18', ' 180 n'], [' male', ' 40', ' 175']], 'andrew': [[' male', ' 18', ' 180 n'], [' male', ' 40', ' 175']]}"
