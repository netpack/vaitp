"how do i run an executable, then continue after it stops? what i'm wanting to do is save files written by the executable i'm running to a dropbox folder. the files are saved at random times, so i can't use a timer...the only ways i know of executing files are non-blocking, and when i run the functions, they simply just execute and continue (for example, using subprocess to run a start command with the argument being the executable)...i can't modify the executable, i can only run it...here's what i've tried so far: i have looked up the question and haven't found anything. the only way i know of executing something with blank is using the  suprocess' call function and the popen function, and using the start command to execute the executable. but that is still non-blocking, and continues after the executable has started, not ended."
