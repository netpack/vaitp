"how to use condition to check a child-class inside a parent-class method, if the child-class is in other py script? i have a parent class in a parent.py..class parent:.  def __init__(self):.    pass..  def some_function(self):.    if self.__class__ is child_one:.      pass # do something.    elif self.__class__ is child_two:.      pass # do other things...then i have another child_one.py and child_two.py which contains similar codes: ..from .parent import parent..class child_one(parent):.  def child_function(self):.    self.some_function()...before i separated child_one and child_two from parent.py, the function works fine. but since i moved the two-child classes into other scripts for better code maintenance, the two conditions would be comparing an undefined object, which is invalid..is there any way i can fix this?"
