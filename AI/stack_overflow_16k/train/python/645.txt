"2d matrix transpose using blank 3 i am making a matrix from user input and later transposing it but i am getting the following error ..'map' object is not subscriptable.i have problem understanding how the map function is working under the hood...note that i don't want to use any library such a numpy...row.append(input(.    ""enter the first row of the matrix(3 integers space seperated)."")).row.append(input(.    ""enter the second row of the matrix(3 integers space seperated)."")).row.append(input(.    ""enter the third row of the matrix(3 integers space seperated).""))..matrix = [map(int, i.split()) for i in row].t_matrix = [[matrix[j][i] for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)].print(t_matrix)"
