"can someone tell me what's wrong with the following code? everything works as it is intended except when info2 is written, sometimes the ""143f"" line doesn't exist that leads to info2 not existing so the written format is ruined...with open(""saved"") as f:.    with open(""autolist"",""a"") as f1:.        for line in f:.            ff=false.            if ""062"" in line:.                trim=line.find('""',64).                info=line[64:endof].                print info.                f1.write(info+"":"").            if ""143f"" in line:.                trim=line.find('""',71).                info2=line[71:endof].                f1.write(info2+""n"")...if line ""143f"" doesn't exist then i'd want to write a ""n"" instead of nothing. for some reason it doesn't work."
