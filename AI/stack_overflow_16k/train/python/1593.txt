"blank - how to simultaneously iterate and modify list, set, etc in my program i have many lines where i need to both iterate over a something and modify it in that same for loop...however, i know that modifying the thing over which you're iterating is bad because it may - probably will - result in an undesired result...so i've been doing something like this:..for el_idx, el in enumerate(thelist):.    if thelist[el_idx].issomething() is true:.        thelist[el_idx].setit(false)...is this the best way to do this?"
