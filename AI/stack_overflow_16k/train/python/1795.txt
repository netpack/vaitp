"problem importing modules and functions in blank i have two files: in one of them (named myrandom) i have defined a function called spinner that would choose a random number from 1 to 6 and would return its value. in the second file, named main, i have imported the first one (as a module) and have also called the spinner function...this is the code of the file myrandom:..def spinner():.    import random.    val = random.choice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).    return val...and this is the code of main:..import myrandom..x = spinner().print(x)...my problem is that when i run main, i get the following error message: ""nameerror: name spinner() is not defined"". i don't know why i'm getting this error, since i have other files and modules with similar characteristics that run without problems...any idea?"
