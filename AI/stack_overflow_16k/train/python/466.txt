"pounds and ounces in blank i just started to learn coding and i'm having an issue trying to get the pounds converted over to ounces. we're suppose to allow the user to input their data like 6 pounds 2 ounces. i'm stuck at the moment and i'm not even sure if i'm going about this right. any help would be appreciated. ..your program will accept as input the weights in pounds and ounces for a set of rabbits fed with one type of food. let the user provide the name of food. accept input until the user types a zero weight. make life easier by converting weights to ounces. compute the arithmetic mean (average) of each set of rabbits. determine which set of rabbits weighs the most, reporting their average weight. ..this was my orignal code before using pounds and ounces and it worked fine using simple number like 13...f1 = input(""name of food:"")..print (f1)..counter = 0.sum = 0..question = input('''enter a weight? type ""yes"" or ""no"" nn''')..while question == ""yes"" :.    ent_num = int(input(""weight of rabbit:"")).    sum = sum + ent_num.    counter = counter + 1.    question = input('''enter another weight? type ""yes"" or ""no"". n ''')..print (""average weight "" + str(sum/counter))...my current code looks like this after i tried to implement pounds and ounces into the input...f1 = input(""name of food: "").print (f1)..counter = 0.sum = 0..print (""please enter inforamtion in pounds and ounces. end"").question = input('''enter a weight? type ""yes"" or ""no"" nn''')..while question == ""yes"" :.    ent_num = int(input(""weight of rabbit:"")).    sum = sum + ent_num.    counter = counter + 1.if pounds * ounces == 0:.    allounces = pounds * 16 + ounces.    sum = sum + allounces..print (""average weight "" + str(sum/counter))"
