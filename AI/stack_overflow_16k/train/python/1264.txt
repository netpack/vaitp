"open file and with statement in blank i have a function like:..def func(filename):.    with open(filename) as f:.        return [line.split('t')[0] for line in f]...is the ""with"" statement closing the file even when there is a 'sudden' function return? can i ignore the ""with"" statement? i.e. is it safe and equivalent (from a memory leak perspective) to do,..def func(filename):.    return [line.split('t')[0] for line in open(filename)]...?"
