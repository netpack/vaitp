"trying to code 99 bottles of beer in blank i'm in an intro to programming using blank class and our homework is to do the 99 bottles of beer song. we haven't learned a lot yet so this is really all i can come up with: ..def standardverse():.    print n, ""bottles of beer on the wall,"", n, "",bottles of beer"".    print ""take one down pass it around,"",n,""bottles of beer on the wall.""..def twobottles():.    print ""two bottles of beer on the wall, two bottles of beer."".    print ""take one down pass it around, one bottle of beer on the wall.""..def onebottle():.    print ""one bottle of beer on the wall, one bottle of beer."".    print ""take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.""..def nobottles():.    print ""no more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer."".    print ""go to the store, buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.""..for n in range(99,0,-1):.    if n &gt; 2:.        print standardverse.    if n == 2:.        print twobottles.    if n == 1:.        print onebottle.    if n &lt;= 1:.        print nobottles...it gives me this when i run it ..&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function standardverse at 0x027bec30&gt;.&lt;function twobottles at 0x027bec70&gt;.&lt;function onebottle at 0x027becb0&gt;.&lt;function nobottles at 0x027becf0&gt;...and so on up to the 99 bottles (i didn't copy it all for the sake of space.) ..what can i do to make it print out the actual song?"
