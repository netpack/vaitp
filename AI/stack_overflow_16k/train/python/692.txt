"appending blank dictionary for unordered data i have a large json file i am trying to extract specific data from, then consolidate a subset into a dictionary.  within the json file, multiple objects reference the same name (person), but each object contains separate information about that person (e.g. one object has their phone numbers, another has their address, another has their email).  so far, extracting the data has not been an issue.  where i am struggling is building the dictionary to consolidate everything.  ..what i am trying to do is:..1) create the dictionary:..names = {}...2) since the data is unordered, i need to create a key for that person...n = name.names['name'] = n ...3) as i identify the record type, then add that persons data to the dictionary..p = phonenumber.a = address.names[n]['phonenumber'] = p.names[n]['address'] = a...in the end, once the entire json file is iterated over, the dictionary should be complete.  ..i suspect my code works when creating a new person that didn't exist prior, but when i add additional information, i am overwriting the prior keys vs. appending the dictionary entry...what i am wondering is:..1) if my overwrite vs. append logic correct?..2) how can i accomplish this?  is using a dictionary bad for this?"
