"turning blank short form for loop into long form i have got this line of code from https://stevenloria.com/tf-idf/..scores = {word: tfidf(word, blob, bloblist) for word in blob.words}...where the tfidf function is:..import math.from textblob import textblob as tb..def tf(word, blob):.    return blob.words.count(word) / len(blob.words)..def n_containing(word, bloblist):.    return sum(1 for blob in bloblist if word in blob.words)..def idf(word, bloblist):.    return math.log(len(bloblist) / (1 + n_containing(word, bloblist)))..def tfidf(word, blob, bloblist):.    return tf(word, blob) * idf(word, bloblist)...in order to better understand the process, i'd like to turn the shorthand loop into a regular-looking ""for"" loop...would this be correct?..scores = [].for word in blob.words:.    scores.append(tfidf(word, blob, bloblist))...also, what's the advantage or writing short-form for loops?"
