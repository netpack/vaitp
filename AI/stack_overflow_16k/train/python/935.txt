"rendering number to n variable places attempting to print pi rendered to inputted decimal places using {:.nf}..tried replacing variable n with inputted variable n. also replacing n with {} and assigning n to that. also replacing n with {n}...i'm sure the answer is obvious but i can't seem to see it...from math import pi..# example input() statement.n = int(input('please enter an integer: '))..format_string = '{:.nf}'..# replace this with your own print statement.print(format_string.format(pi))...expecting pi to n decimal places, yet it is returning:...  ""valueerror: format specifier missing precision"" ...which i assume means variable format_string is not formatted correctly."
