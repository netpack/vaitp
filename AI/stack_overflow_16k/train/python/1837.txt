"editing file header info in blank i'm pretty new to blank, and i'm trying to edit data in a .mobi file from a blank script. i am able to read all the meta data, but i can't figure out how to save the info i need back into the correct place. every time i try, it just corrupts the file...this is a snippet of what i'm having problems with:..    metadata['asin'] = ""b00012345"".    data += ""modified asin: "" + metadata['asin']..    g = file(infile).    header2 = g.read(312)..    f = open(infile, 'wb').    f.seek(header2[0xa4e]).    f.write(metadata['asin']).    f.close()...can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?..thanks"
