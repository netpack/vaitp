"making a loop to go on for as long as the number is i want a program so i can enter a big integer and it will do a calculation like this: .62439 = (6 - 2 + 4 - 3 + 9)..basically it splits them up and the first and third should be added and the second and the fourth should be subtracted. please follow the loop sort of method. i can't have the elif and if working in the same run of the loop...num = input(""input any number: "").total = 0.p = 0.x= 0.q = 0.number = len(num).if len(num) ==5 :.    total = 0.    for i in range(0,(number)):.        p = p+2.        q = q +1.        if x == 2 and q == p:.            total = total+(int(num[q])).            x=1.            p=p-1.        elif  x == 1 and q == p :.            total = total-(int(num[q])).            x=2.            p=p-1.    print(""your number is: "",total)...i expect it to repeat the loop as many times as there are numbers in the integer that is entered e.g (333) executes 3 times"
