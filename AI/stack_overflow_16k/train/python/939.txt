"counting letters in a string i am wondering how to count specific letters in a string. the first thing that popped into my head was the function len. out of curiosity, is there a way to write this code without using built in functions and using len? ..there is a question asked similar to this here and i am having trouble understanding it. ..def count_letters(word, char):.  count = 0.  for c in word:.    if char == c:.      count = count + 1.  return count...what exactly is going on in if char == c: and count += 1? i understand why the person started with a for loop but i don't understand why place an if after?"
