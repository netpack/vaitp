"blank 3.4 error - typeerror: 'nonetype' object is not callable i'm in the early stages of learning blank and following various online/training videos...i'm running blank 3.4.x x64, using pycharms in windows...in this particular example to learn how to use pysftp, the example script is to first upload a file to a server, and then the second part is to download a file from the server...the first part (uploading a file to a server) worked perfect.  that function is now commented out.  the second part of the script is to now pull down this file from the server, and there is where the script is failing. i'm using the identical code as the example i'm following, so i am wondering if maybe my system is missing something...below is the script, and below that are the errors i saw when running in debugging mode using pdb:..import pysftp as sftp.#import pdb..def push_file_to_server():.    s = sftp.connection(host='192.168.2.36',.                        username ='root',.                        password='xxxxxxx')..    local_path = ""testme.txt"".    remote_path = ""/home/testme.txt"".    s.put(local_path, remote_path).    s.close()..#push_file_to_server()...#pdb.set_trace()..def get_file_from_server():.    s = sftp.connection(host='192.168.2.36',.                        username ='root',.                        password='xxxxxxx')..    local_path = ""testme.txt"".    remote_path = ""/home/testme.txt""..    s.get(remote_path, local_path).    s.close()..    get_file_from_server()...when i run the script using debugging, this is where in the debugging output i see an error:...........&gt; c:blank34liblogging__init__.py(1877)shutdown().-&gt; h.flush().(pdb) n.&gt; c:blank34liblogging__init__.py(1878)shutdown().-&gt; h.close().(pdb) n.&gt; c:blank34liblogging__init__.py(1886)shutdown().-&gt; h.release().(pdb) n.&gt; c:blank34liblogging__init__.py(1869)shutdown().-&gt; for wr in reversed(handlerlist[:]):.(pdb) n.--return--.&gt; c:blank34liblogging__init__.py(1869)shutdown()-&gt;none.-&gt; for wr in reversed(handlerlist[:]):.(pdb) n.--call--.exception ignored in: &lt;function weakset.__init__.&lt;locals&gt;._remove at 0x0000000003154158&gt;.traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""c:blank34lib_weakrefset.py"", line 38, in _remove.  file ""c:blank34libbdb.py"", line 50, in trace_dispatch.  file ""c:blank34libbdb.py"", line 82, in dispatch_call.  file ""c:blank34libpdb.py"", line 249, in user_call.  file ""c:blank34libpdb.py"", line 345, in interaction.  file ""c:blank34libpdb.py"", line 1447, in print_stack_entry.  file ""c:blank34libbdb.py"", line 391, in format_stack_entry.  file ""&lt;frozen importlib._bootstrap&gt;"", line 2236, in _find_and_load.  file ""&lt;frozen importlib._bootstrap&gt;"", line 265, in __enter__.typeerror: 'nonetype' object is not callable...i looked up the error a bit, with my limited knowledge it sounds like it's a complaint when arguments are missing in a function, but i don't know what to do differently and the first part of the script works fine when tested (uploading) and this is the same as that part just reversed and using get instead of put...thanks in advance for any guidance."
