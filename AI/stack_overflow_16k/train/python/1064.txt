"reading & modifying line from file i want the user to modify the line from file with some integers calculation included (calculation will obviously the program will do) however user provides the quantity...my file contains:..you have purchased 8 bananas of 40$.you have purchased 2 apples of 2$...now users select a line for eg line number 2 in this case. and then program asks for what you want to do edit or remove. if users select edit so it asks for quantity so if user input a quanity of 5 apples this time. i want the file to change that 2 to 5 and also calculate the total price by using a simple formula. meaning the original quanity divided by price so we will get the original price then it multiplies by the new quanity and save in that location of 2$. and after changing this line saves back to the file in its original location...what i have tried:..line = f.readlines().option = int(input('select line number to edit or remove:')).selectedline = line[option-1].print(selectedline,'[selected]').action = int(input('''what you want to do.[1] edit quantity.[2] remove.''')).edit = selectedline.split()    ..if action == 1:.    qty = int(input('enter new quanity')).    edit[-1] = edit[3]/edit[-1].    edit[3] = qty.    edit[-1] = qty*edit[-1].    print(edit)...but the problem is when i use split the data goes into the list in the form of strings and error cant multiply and divide on strings. also how can i resave this line back to its original position."
