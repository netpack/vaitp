"how to glob for iterable element i have a blank dictionary that contains iterables, some of which are lists, but most of which are other dictionaries. i'd like to do glob-style assignment similar to the following:..myiter['*']['*.txt']['name'] = 'woot'...that is, for each element in myiter, look up all elements with keys ending in '.txt' and then set their 'name' item to 'woot'...i've thought about sub-classing dict and using the fnmatch module.  but, it's unclear to me what the best way of accomplishing this is."
