"blank http.server command gives ""syntax error"" i am trying to start http.server from the blank shell (blank 3.6.2).  in the shell, i issue the following commands:..import http.server.import socketserver.blank -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1...the last line comes directly from the latest blank docs on http.server, but the shell says ""syntax error.""  ..then i tried :..blank3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1...but the shell still says ""syntax error.""  ..then i tried the simplest command:..blank -m http.server also says ""syntax error"":  ...but the shell still says ""syntax error.""  ..what am i doing wrong?  ..thanks for any help."
