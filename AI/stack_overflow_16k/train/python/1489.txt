"read and write to a list of names and scores - blank i am trying to create a program that gives the user a short quiz and create a score, which i have done, then i would like to add them to a list in a .txt file. in the program i will ask them their name, so say i have a list such as this;..bob,7..bill,5..jane,6..and someone takes the quiz and inputs the name bob and gets a score 4 the list will update to;..bob,4..bill,5..jane,6..or someone new takes a quiz, sarah it will change to;..bob,4..bill,5..jane,6..sarah,7..so far i have;..import random.file = open(""scores.txt"", ""r"")..userscore=random.randint(0,10)..lines = file.readlines()..file.close()..student=input('what is your name? ')..file = open(""scores.txt"", ""w"").for line in lines:.    line = line.strip().    name, score = line.strip().split("","").    if name!=student:.        file.write(line).    else:.        file.write(name +',' +str(userscore))...i've randomised the score for now to make it easier to read, however that will be from what the user answered correctly, and i thought this code would read the file then check each name from each line and if the name they entered is the same to the name in the list the line will be replaced with the name and score. however, the file just ends up blank, what am i doing wrong?"
