"blank - reading through the same file from different starting lines i am trying to read a .non file (you can find an example here)..those files contains 4 keys: width, height, rows and columns (both are made of multiple values)...width and height are always before rows, columns or in my case goal, thus i have to go through the file while not knowing when i'll find what i need...here's what i'm trying to do:..# this function will create the grid.def fcreate(grid_id):.    gridfile = open(grid_id['grid'], ""r"").    # here, we're going through the entire file, getting the values we need..    # still working on a pretty way to make the dictionary !.    for line in gridfile:.        if ""width"" in line:.            grid_id['width'] = re.sub('[a-z]', '', line).strip().        if ""height"" in line:.            grid_id['height'] = re.sub('[a-z]', '', line).strip().        if ""rows"" in line:.            # get all the rows values until something else ? or eof.        if ""columns"" in line:.            # get all the columns values until something else ? or eof.    # end of the for.    gridfile.close().    return grid_id.    pass...grid_id contains all the values i have to get...i've tried making a new for in the ""if ""rows"""", a while and whatnot, but can't seem to escape either reading through the entire file again or looping on the line that contains ""rows"" or ""columns."
