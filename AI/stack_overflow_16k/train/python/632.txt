"object is not subscriptable in blank i have the following code:..c = containers[0].resources.limits['cpu']..cpulimit = int(c.split(""m"")[0])...this works, but this code:..int(containers[0].resources.limits['cpu'].split(""m"")[0])...gives me : ..typeerror: 'type' object is not subscriptable...containers[0].resources.limits has type dictionary:.i.e limits contains { ""cpu"": ""500m"" , ""memory"": ""512mi""}"
