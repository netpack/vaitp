"behaviour of equality and nested structures at some point i got in set in my head that an equality statement against two deeply nested structures is not reliable. it it ever the case that some deep nest is ignored when doing a equality check on the outermost container? ..i should be clear in stating that by deeply nested structure i mean:...containing only dict, list, built in types and objects i know to compare like datetime.   .list order is important  .the container size can be very deep or very wide.no generators or custom iterators.there is no recursive parts to the nesting...i've done a number of tests and i always get the answer i expect. but, it's nearly impossible to consider the tests i can't think of :)"
