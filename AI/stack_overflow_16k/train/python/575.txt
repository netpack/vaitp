"xxblank comment multiple line not working in array for example:.i have..array = [.1,.2,.3,.4.]...i want to comment out 2 and 3.this works:..array = [.1,.#2,.#3,.4.]...this does not:..array = [.1,.'''.2,.3,.'''.4.]...now imagine that array is huge. hundreds of lines. i cannot find a easy way to do it unless use some editor trick..i cannot believe that blank as a language does not have something that works for multiple lines of comment properly..again, the fact it does not have {} is way messed up than this..please point out how this should be done and that i'm too stupid to find it with google...-- edit 2 --.i agree with everyone that store data this way is not ideal. but i have some existing bad code. i need to deal quickly to figure out the problem. let's face it, we've all been there unless you never worked in a real job. any other language i worked with before have syntax to block comment multiple lines that works anywhere in the code. don't anyone feel this is a problem for blank?"
