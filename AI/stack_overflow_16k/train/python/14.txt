"comparing the values of two dict_values based on certain criteria i have two dictionaries that i'd liked to compare their dict_values based on certain criteria, say the value at index 0 and 2 on their respective dict_values have to be the same to be considered equal...this code works:..a = dict().b = dict().a[1,3] = 5, 6, 7.b[1,4] = 5, 9, 7.a_tuple = (list(a.values()))[0].b_tuple = (list(b.values()))[0].if a_tuple[0] == b_tuple[0] and a_tuple[2] == b_tuple[2]:.   print('equal')...is there a shorter/efficient way to do this ?...thanks in advance!..john"
