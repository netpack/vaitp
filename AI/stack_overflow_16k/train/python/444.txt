"how to attach any function parameter to out put list in blank i am new to blank and using function capability of blank for the very first time. i have written thr codes like:..def chunks(l, n):.    for i in range(0, len(l), n):.        chunk = l[i:i+n].        g = chunk.count('g').        c = chunk.count('c').        a = chunk.count('a').        t = chunk.count('t').        g_c = g+c.        total_g_c_a_t = g_c+a+t.        g_c_contents = ((g_c) / float(total_g_c_a_t))*100.        gc_window100.append(g_c_contents).    print (gc_window100).chunks (list3, 100).chunks (list3, 150).chunks (list3, 200)...my question is: how i can attach the value of n with list for that calculation? like i am using gc_window100, i want 100 should come from function parameter so that i can keep track of list, from which chunk it came from. i need to repeat this function several time. .and output i want like:..gc_window100 = [30, 32, 31, 42]..gc_window150 = [18, 20, 22, 20]..gc_window200 = [15, 13, 16, 10]........any help? thanks in advance."
