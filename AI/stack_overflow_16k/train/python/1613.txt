"finding a string in a list and returning a secondary value with blank i am trying to find a way to search for a string in a list of values and return a secondary value if it is there. the ability to do a ""close"" match would be even better...the list of values i will be using is decently large (200,000+ records) and has the construction of:..data1 -&gt; number1.data2 -&gt; number2.data3 -&gt; number3...i will be using my string to compare with data1, and if it matches i would like to return number1...the data can be manipulated in any way, as i have access to the raw data...the strings i will be using for the search are user created and do not have consistency, hence why a ""close"" match would be very helpful...an example of the data for the search vs actual would be as follows:..user value: abc co inc.actual value: abc company, inc..user value: baker company.actual value: baker company, inc...there will be larger inconsistencies, but those will most likely need to be manually edited regardless. i am just trying to lighten the workload of manual entries. ..what would be the best way to go about this?"
