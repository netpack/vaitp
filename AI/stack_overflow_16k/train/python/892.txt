"interaction between blank script and user in text mode i am seeking for a good example or manual describing standards of text-based dialogs in a linux console using standard i/o commands and utilizing formatted text output. for example: how to inquire input of parameters proposing some default values and alternatives, how to do a progress bar in the text mode, and other stuff which looks very cool in bash scripts."
