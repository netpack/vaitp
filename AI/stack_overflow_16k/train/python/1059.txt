"using append method in a for loop i'm currently looking at this code snippet from think blank implementing an inverted dictionary with the setdefault method, and i'm unclear on why it works:..def invert_dict(d):.""""""inverts a dictionary, returning a map from val to a list of keys...if the mapping key-&gt;val appears in d, then in the new dictionary.val maps to a list that includes key...d: dict..returns: dict."""""".    inverse = {}.    for key, val in d.iteritems():.        inverse.setdefault(val, []).append(key).    return inverse...reading from left to right in the for loop, inverse.setdefault(val, []) creates an entry in the dictionary, not a list. so how can we use the append method?"
