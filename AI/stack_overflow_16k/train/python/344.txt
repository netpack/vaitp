"can't get ternary operator to work so i have a double problem. i have selectedcards list, which contains 2 elements - card rank and suit, in this format: ['6', 'c'] ..club = u""u2663"" # unicode codepoint for club..newlist = [club for i in selectedcards if i == 'c' else i]..i want to change 'c' into graphical representation of club, but this expression not working. i tried searching a lot but couldn't find what's wrong. it says: syntaxerror: invalid syntax..second problem, if i remove else statement, then it works, but it does not output what i want, it looks like this: [u'u2663'], even thought print(club) outputs â™£...edit: newlist = [club if i == 'c' else i for i in selectedcards] is the correct syntax, thanks to xtofl."
