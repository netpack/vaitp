"how to use a random function inside an if statement and use speak function in blank at the same time i'm working on a virtual assitant using blank and a few libraries like speech_recognition, gtts, and mpg321..now my assistant has one specific reply for any identified dialog, but i want it to reply in a randomized fashion. ..here's the code..def violet(data):..    if ""what is violet"" in data:.        speak(""yours truly."")..    if ""are you a robot"" in data:.        speak(""i don't know what you've heard but virtual assistants have feelings too!"")...how to use the random function here?"
