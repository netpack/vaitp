"blank, return calculations with %d i have a silly question..i have a def like this:..def render_row_number(self):.    return '%d' % next(self.counter)...comes from an app, which i cannot change. it counts the row numbers of a table, but starts from 0, instead of 1. so i wondered, could i just add a +1 to it? .so it would look something like:..return '%d' + 1 % next(self.counter)...but would be actually working :p..thank you for your time and help!"
