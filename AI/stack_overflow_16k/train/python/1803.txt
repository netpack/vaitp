"how to proxy all methods from a blank module to another? i want to have in my application a common logging module that logs to a file. .for example in my commonlog.py i can have something like this:..# blank logging module.import logging                                                   ..logging.basicconfig(filename=""test.log"", level=logging.debug) ...from the other modules in the application i want to import this module and be able to use it like if it was the blank logging module but without replicating all its functions, for example from module test.py:..import commonlog..commonlog.debug(""debug message"").commonlog.info(""info message"").commonlog.any_other_method_that_belongs_to_logging()...how can i ""proxy"" in my commonlog all the methods from the logging module ?..doing:..commonlogging.logging.etc.....is not a valid solution because it's using the logging module directly."
