"can't understand how to pass variables to function within class so i am confident working with functions now, and passing values in...so for example..def myfunction(arg1,arg2,arg3):.    print 'my args %s %s %s' % (arg1, arg2, arg3)...i can then call that function as follows..myfunction(arg1,arg2,arg3)...what i would like to do is move myfunction, into myclass:..myclass():.    myfunction(arg1,arg2,arg3)...i have no idea how to pass these args (variables) in or call them from outside, as all of the examples online don't seem to match this case...sorry if this is very rudimentary / basic , but i am struggling to jump the gap here in my understanding."
