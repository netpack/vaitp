"trim a string by the index of the first letter character i have a list of categories:..categories = [.    '01-1 category 1',.    '01-2 category with a lot of spaces between words',.    '01   only one code category',.    '02 1 two codes category'.]...the task is to cut off the category code  and keep only category names. so the output should be:..# pprint.pprint(output_list)..['category 1',. 'category with a lot of spaces between words',. 'only one code category',. 'two codes category']...i solved it:..for category in categories:.    letter_index = 0..    for char in category:  # find index of first letter.        if char.isalpha():.            break..        letter_index += 1..    output.append(category[letter_index:])...it seems the solution looks like c-style. is there more blankic way to solve the problem?"
