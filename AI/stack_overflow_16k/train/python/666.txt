"what is the more appropriate strategy to take for resolving the following issue? would anyone happen to know of a blank fix to achieve the following resolution for power bi bar graph x-axis :..figure a: represents a working graph that has all the records for the specified periods listed in the x-axis. ..figure a..figure b : represents a working graph that does not have all the records available yet but will soon be added as time progresses...figure b..figure c : is a rendered representation of the desired outcome for figure b ..figure c..my question is to you, how would you propose what area i should research in resolving the above mentioned?..thank you,"
