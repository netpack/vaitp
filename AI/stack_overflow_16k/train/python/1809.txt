"run console application in background i am working on a script in blank where first i set ettercap to arp poisoning and then start urlsnarf to log the urls. i want to have ettercap to start first and then, while poisoning, start urlsnarf. the problem is that these jobs must run at the same time and then urlsnarf show the output. so i thought it would be nice if i could run ettercap in background without waiting to exit and then run urlsnarf. i tried command nohup but at the time that urlsnarf had to show the url the script just ended. i run:..subprocess.call([""ettercap"",.                 ""-m arp /192.168.1.254/ /192.168.1.66/ -p -t -q -i wlan0""])...but i get:...  ettercap ng-0.7.4.2 copyright 2001-2005 alor &amp; naga.  .  mitm method ' arp /192.168.1.254/ /192.168.1.66/ -p -t -q -i wlan0' not supported......which means that somehow the arguments were not passed correctly"
