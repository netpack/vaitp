"can't create dictionary from file because of new line character i have a file that looks like this:..mother jane.father bob.friends ricky,jack,brian,jordan, .        ricardo,sonia,blake...as you can see i have a new line character at the end of ""friends"" first line.  when i want to parse this file to a dictionary it is giving me an error with my current code...i have looked online for the solution and tried multiple things but nothing seems to work. ..with open('./file.txt') as f:.    content = f.readlines()..    dic = {}.    for line in content:.        line_items = line.strip().split().        if len(line_items) &lt;= 2:.            dic[line_items[0]] = line_items[1].        else:.            dic[line_items[0]] = line_items[1:]...i would like to have a result which looks like this:..dict = {""mother"": ""jane"", ""father"": ""bob"",""friends"":[ricky,jack,brian,jordan,ricardo,sonia,blake]...but instead i get an out of index error."
