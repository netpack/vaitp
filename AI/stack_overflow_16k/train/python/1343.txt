"how to turn readlines into a string... perhaps? i think my largest problem is i don't know how to ask the question of what it is exactly that i am looking for...i stole most the code from a flashcard program from http://www.tuxradar.com/content/code-project-build-flash-card-app and modified it a bit to suit my own needs.  however, when i get the answer correct it still says i've gotten it wrong..here is my code:..#!/usr/bin/env blank.import os.import random.import time..file1 = open('/root/first.txt', 'w').file2 = open('/root/second.txt', 'w')..file1.writelines('1n2n3n4n5').file2.writelines('0,2n1,3n2,4n3,5n4,6')..time.sleep(1)..file1.close.file2.close..time.sleep(1)..file1 = open('/root/first.txt', 'r').file2 = open('/root/second.txt', 'r')..count = 0.score = 0.tries = int(raw_input('how many tries?')).start_time = time.time()..f1content = file1.readlines().f2content = file2.readlines()..try:.    while count &lt; tries:.        os.system('clear')..        wordnum = random.randint(0, len(f1content)-1).        correct = str(f2content[wordnum])..        print 'number:', f1content[wordnum], ''..        answer = input('nsurrounding numbers?')..        if answer == correct:.            raw_input('ncorrect! hit enter...').            score = score + 1.        else:.            print 'nnope, it's', correct.            raw_input('hit enter to try a new one...')..        count = count + 1..except syntaxerror:.    print 'you must enter a value, starting over'.    os.system('./flash.py')..finally:.    file1.close.    file2.close.    os.system('rm /root/first.txt').    os.system('rm /root/second.txt')..stop_time = time.time() - start_time.print 'nit took you', stop_time / 60, 'minutes to get', score, 'out of', count, 'correct'...i postulate that my problem lies in line 35 where i define correct as ..correct = str(f2content[wordnum])...the reason i think this is because if it gives me 1 and i know that the correct answer is 0,2 and i type that in, it say's nope, it's 0,2.  this suggests that in plain text it is the exact same to the human eye but that the computer is reading it as something different. i tried to make it a string because of this and making it an integer causes an error. i'm really stuck and am sure it's something so simple but i am just not seeing it.  any help would be appreciated.  even if it is just a point in the right direction of where i can find the answer."
