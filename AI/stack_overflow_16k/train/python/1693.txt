"blank property getter and setter decorator not callable i'm doing something similar to the following ..class parrot(object):.    def __init__(self):.        self.__voltage = 100000..    @property.    def voltage(self):.        """"""get the current voltage."""""".        return self.__voltage...however it sees the voltage property as an int so when i call like so..p = parrot().print(p.voltage())...i get..typeerror: 'int' object is not callable...i've tried with one and two underscored to mangle the voltage property name."
