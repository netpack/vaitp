"can't understand the result of innerclass i has met a problem when i was learning innerclass of blank..class innerclass:.    ""the example of innerclass"".    string='hello world'..    class inner_class:.        msg='inner class'.        print(msg)..    def func0(self):.        print(self.string).        print(""public method"").        self._func1()  #the use of private method..    def _func1(self):   #private method can't be used directly.        print(self.string).        print(""private method"")..    @classmethod.    def classfun2(self):.        print(self.string).        print(""class method"")..    @staticmethod.    def staticfun3():.        print(innerclass.string).        print(""static method"")...g=innerclass().#public method and private method g.func0().#class method g.classfun2().#static method.g.staticfun3()...the results of this:..inner class.hello world.public method.hello world.private method.hello world.class method.hello world.static method...what i was confused is that why did 'inner class' print first not at last"
