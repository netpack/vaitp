"opening/running excel file from blank i need to start excel and open a file directly from blank. currently i am using:..import os.os.system('start excel.exe file.xls')...however i do not get desired result. i want to open a file from local destination (file is in the same folder with program), but this code open's the file with same name in my home (user) directory and not from my program directory."
