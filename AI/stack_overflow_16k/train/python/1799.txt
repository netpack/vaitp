"why does my string.strip() function in blank fails to strip other characters along the same line? for instance, i have this:..stra = ""this is stringt exampltte....wow! !!0000000"".print stra.strip('t')....  his is stringt exampltte....wow! !!0000000...why does the function only strip the first 't'?..in contrast, we have this:.    stra = ""000000this is stringt exampltte....wow! !!0000000"".    print stra.strip('0')...  this is stringt exampltte....wow! !!...which strips all of the '0'. why would this remove all '0' in this case but not in the case of 't'?..third variation, we have this:..stra = ""000000this is stringt exampltte....wow! !!0000000"".print stra.strip('this')....  000000this is stringt exampltte....wow! !!0000000...which removes nothing at all! not even in the words that have t,h,i,s in it. but if we were to remove the zeros from the start,..stra = ""this is stringt exampltte....wow! !!0000000"".print stra.strip('this')....  is stringt exampltte....wow! !!0000000...it seems that the strip function in my blank 2.7.x only works for the first combination of characters separated by whitespace, or for only number strings! why is this so?"
