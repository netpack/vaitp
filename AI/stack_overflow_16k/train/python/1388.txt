"where do i find the blank standard library code? i wanted to try and look up the source of some of the modules in the blank standard library, but wasn't able to find them. i tried looking in the modules directory after downloading the blank tarball, but it has mainly .c files. i also tried looking at the directory where the blank that already comes with the os (mac osx) has it's modules, and there it seems to have mainly .pyc and .pyo files. would really appreciate it if someone can help me out...(i tried what was suggested in the question how do i find the location of blank module sources? with no luck)"
