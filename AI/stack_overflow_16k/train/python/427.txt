"remove method (remove odd numbers) we want to write a function that removes all the odd numbers in a list...this is what i finally tried:..def eliminate(x):.    for i in range(0, (len(x)-1)):.        if x[i] % 2 != 0:.           x.remove(x[i]).    print(x).eliminate([1,2,5,6])...i get the error: ""list index out of range!""..i'd really appreciate it if you could help because it's driving me crazy that i can't figure out what i'm doing wrong. i tried pop and delete methods too. but i don't know what i'm doing wrong here. it's definitely the 4th line, though. any ideas?!"
