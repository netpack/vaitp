"how to have cfiles in blank code i'm using the geany ide and i've wrote a blank code that makes a gui. im new to blank and i'm better with c. i've done research on the web and its too complicated because theres so much jargon involved. behind each button i want c to be the backbone of it (so c to execute when clicked). so, how can i make a c file and link it to my code?"
