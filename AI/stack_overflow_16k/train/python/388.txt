"blank tell() behaving differently regarding position in the current file in the book - core blank programming, there is following example - ...>>> f = open('/tmp/x', 'w+').>>> f.tell().0.>>> f.write('test line 1n')  # add 12-char string [0-11].>>> f.tell().12.>>> f.write('test line 2n')  # add 12-char string [12-23].>>> f.tell()                  # tell us current file location (end)).24...when i run the same code in my interpreter, i get 13l in place of 12 and 26l in place of 24. .i am running blank 2.5 on windows. ..has anything changed regarding behaviour or tell() in versions? how does tell decide the position in the file...thanks and regards"
