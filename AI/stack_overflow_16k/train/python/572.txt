"add one to a list element i have an empty list called mylist which looks like..[none,none,none,none,none,none,none]...i have a for loop which will add one to each element each time its past over...i am trying to add 1 to an element using:..mylist[i] = mylist[i]+1 ...but i get the error:..typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'nonetype' and 'int'...the number of times the list is iterated over changes so ican't just add one to all elements...the code i'm using is:..for j in range(0,bucketsize):.    for i in range (0,minibuckets):.        list[i] = list[i]+1"
