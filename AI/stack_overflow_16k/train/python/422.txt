"clean way to accomplish -- if x in [(0, 1, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0)]:? if not, then a canonical name for a function? 'cycle' makes sense to me, but that's taken...the example in the header is written for clarity and brevity. real cases i'm working with have a lot of repetition..(e.g., i want [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1] to ""match"" [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0])..this type of thing is obscuring my algorithm and filling my code with otherwise useless repetition."
