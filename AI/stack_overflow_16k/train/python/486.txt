"using integer argument in blank for a for loop newbie to blank here, i am trying to use an integer as an argument for a for loop. the code i use ..from sys import argv..script, numberofposts = argv.postsint = int(numberofposts)..for x in range(0,""%d"" % postsint):.    print 'on time'..print ""number %d"" % postsint...gives me this error - ..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""forarg.py"", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;.    for x in range(0,""%d"" % postsint):.typeerror: range() integer end argument expected, got str....what am i doing wrong here? i assumed that it was a syntax issue but the error seems to indicate that the for loop is expecting an integer which i attempted to force as you can see."
