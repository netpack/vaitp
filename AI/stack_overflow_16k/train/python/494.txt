"shutil - move and rename in my blank script i am moving a bunch of files from different sub directories to one location the trouble with this is that there are multiple files the same...the code i am currently running is:..for root, dirs, files in os.walk(dir_path):.    for file in files:.        if file.endswith('.log'):            .            shutil.move(os.path.join(root, file), file_location_path)...the trouble with this is it will throw the error eventually of:..  file ""downloader.py"", line 78, in &lt;module&gt;.    shutil.move(os.path.join(root, file), file_location_path).  file ""/usr/lib/blank3.6/shutil.py"", line 548, in move.    raise error(""destination path '%s' already exists"" % real_dst).shutil.error: destination path '/home/a.log' already exists....i can negate this by changing my move line to copy such as the below..shutil.move(os.path.join(root, file), file_location_path)...this will however replace any files with this name with the latest copy. i am trying to figure out a way i can rename any files with the same name to follow a naming convention like this..a.log..a_1.log..a_2.log..any suggestions on how best to approach this or sample code. i am new to blank and trying to complete my first practical script."
