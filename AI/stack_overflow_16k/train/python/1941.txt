"how to count the number of characters (nucleotides) in an input sequence (dna) i've been racking my brain for a while on how i could adequately solve this assignment problem. ..the assignment asks: for a given dna sequence, how many nucleotides are there? so if one were to give any random input of dna using the nucleotide base pairs ""a"", ""c"", ""g"", ""t"", how many of each nucleotide base pairs are there? (so how many ""a"", ""c"", ""g"", ""t"". ..ex: if i input cagggttacccctttacgtt, i want my program to be able to tell me in a print statement:.a: #number of a's, c: #number of c's, g: #number of g's, t: #number of t's...this is what i have so far, but i keep getting the error that i do not have integers. ..sequence = input(""enter a dna sequence:"")..nba = nbc = nbg = nbt = 0..composition = sequence.upper()..if composition in sequence == sequence.upper() :.    sequence = input(""enter a dna sequence: "").    for nucleotide in composition:.        if nucleotide == ""a"":.            nba += 1.            nba.count(""a"").        if nucleotide == ""c"":.            nbc += 1.            nbc.count(""c"").        if nucleotide == ""g"":.            nbg += 1.            nbg.count(""g"").        if nucleotide == ""t"":.            nbt += 1.            nbt.count(""t"").        print(nba, "" "", nbc, "" "", nbg, "" "", nbt, "" "")...help? thank you!"
