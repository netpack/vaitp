"how to get the number of inputs from the user dynamically? i am the getting multiple inputs from the user which i can't measure, how can i read all the inputs dynamically...for example ..a,b = input(), input()..we can get only two inputs but i want to take multiple inputs at a time without knowing the count of inputs we are getting...my input is coming as..3.11.1 2 -1 4 0 5 -3 8 7 0 10.10.1 2 -1 4 0 5 -3 8 7 10.5.1 2 3 4 5.....etc...each line each input."
