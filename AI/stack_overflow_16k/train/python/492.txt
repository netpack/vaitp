"import object from file without running that file's imports not sure this is possible, but would like to know if there are any suggestions...say i have a file foo.py which looks like..import doesnotexist..bar = ""hello, world!""...i want to do a from foo import bar, but this will fail due to the import not existing in the scope of this new file...one way of doing this is putting bar in a new file called bar.py and have foo.py also import that, but would like to skip that if possible...any ideas?"
