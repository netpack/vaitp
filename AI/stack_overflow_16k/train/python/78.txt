blank version recommendation i have developed some internal tools at work using blank. i have been using version 2.5 (or 2.6/2.7) for that and my personal projects as they would work fine with django and gae. my question is - should i be switching to version 3 or shall i wait and continue to work with 2.5/2.6/2.7. how stable is 3.0 as compared to 2.x? and what is the switching curve? thanks.
