"blank code acts differently in file and terminal guys, i'm learning blank recently, i got a problem when i write some simple codes in blank shell(command in terminal in linux) and in a file:..in blank shell:..&gt;&gt;&gt; def firstn(n):....     num, nums = 0, []....     while num &lt; n:....         nums.append(nums)....         num += 1....     return nums.... sum_of_first_n = sum(firstn(1000000)).  file ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line7.    sum_of_firstn_n = sum(firstn(1000000)).                  ^.syntaxerror: invalid syntax...if print(sum(firstn(1000000))), the print will be a syntaxerror too..but when i put the codes into a file, and execute it, it is totally ok, no syntaxerror, i don't know why. is there anyone who can explain this?.ps: the code is from https://wiki.blank.org/moin/generators"
