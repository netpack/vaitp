"unsure of how to reference an element within a list to an if statement for row in range(numlines):.    if row[intidx](3) is not 'dep':.        check_total += float(row[intidx][2]).    else:.        deposit_total += float(row[intidx][2])...i'm very green to blank, coming from vb.net, so it may not make sense...i have a list that has 4 elements per line with a comma delimiter. this block of code is supposed to run through each ""row"" and compare the 4th element with the parameter of the if statement, and to carry on whatever operation depending on the results. ..i keep getting the 'int' object is not a subscriptable error, which i suspect that it might be more errors on top of this one...i just need an explanation of what is going on and how i can improve the code so that my program can run properly...i thank everyone for any input they can give me."
