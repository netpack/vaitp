"removing one list from another in blank (2.7) we can do:..&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3].&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [4 , 5].&gt;&gt;&gt; a + b.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]...however we can't do a - b...since blank seems to have something cool for nearly everything, what is the most blank-esque to do a - b, in your opinion?..similar question for dictionaries, which can neither do a + b, or a - b, where a and b are both dictionaries.  thanks."
