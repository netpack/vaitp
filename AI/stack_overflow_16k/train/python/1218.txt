"zed shaw's exercise 15 open function i am a little stuck with zed shaw's exercise 15..actually i had no problem with the original program,.but the problem is when i try out the extra credit.where he asks us to use raw input instead of argv...so, this is the code i used..filename=raw_input(""enter filename :"").print ""here's your file %r"" % filename.txt=open(filename).print txt.read()...when it asks for filename, i give the path e:blankex15_sample.txt.i am getting the following error in.this line --> txt = open(filename).and it further says.no such file or directory..so, what do i do?"
