"how can i plot an equation into an array with redefined indices so i have an equation lets say: x^2 + y^2..currently, i can make an array that defines the equation, calculates the array based off input parameters and and prints out an array:..def equation(x,y):.  return x**2 + y**2..def calculate(x, y, xmin, ymin):.  out = [].  for i in range(x_min, xs):.    row = [].    for j in range(y_min, ys):.      row.append(equation(i, j)).    out.append(row).  return out...the output array calculates the values based off the indicies .output such that (0,0) is upper left. given an array with length and width, how can i calculate the equation so that the (0,0) is centered and follows a cartesian plane?"
