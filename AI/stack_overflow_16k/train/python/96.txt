"accessing columns in a matrix in blank i am trying to create a simple tictactoe game and am trying to save the rows to a row[] and columns to a columns[] so that i can access each element in the board by doing board[row][col]...i am getting the rows saved when traversing thru the matrix in the first loop but unable to save the column indices. any thoughts on what im doing wrong and how to do it correctly?..heres the code:..board = [ .            ['|', '|', '|' ],.            ['|', '|', '|'],.            ['|', '|', '|'] .        ] ..row = [].col = []..def tictactoe ():..    # print('n'.join([''.join(['{:4}'.format(item) for item in row]) for row in board]))..    for i in range(0,len(board)):.        row.append(board[i]).        for j in (0, len(board)):.            col.append(board[j])...    print(row, '!!!!!').    print(col)"
