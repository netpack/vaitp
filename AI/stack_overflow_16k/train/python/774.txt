"rounding to 2 decimal places in blank this isn't a duplicate because i have checked everything before this post on this site. i think i have managed to do the first two bullet points. the first one i will do through a string but i am willing to change that if you know another way. the 2nd one is using comma seperators for the $'s. so i will use a float but once again am willing to change if better way is found. ..but i am stuck..and the ""print(""%.2f"") % str) is something i found but i need work on rounding to two decimal spaces and the last bullet point...code:..import random...def random_number():.    random_dollars = random.uniform(1.00, 10000.00).    print(round(random_dollars, 2)).    print(""%.2f"") % str...print(random_number())...shell:..c:usersjackepycharmprojectsaslevelhomeworkweek18venvscriptsblank.exe c:/users/jacke/pycharmprojects/aslevelhomeworkweek18/aslevelhomeworkweek18.py 6567.62 traceback (most recent call last): %.2f file ..c:/users/jacke/pycharmprojects/aslevelhomeworkweek18/aslevelhomeworkweek18.py"", line 10, in &lt;module&gt; print(random_number()) file..c:/users/jacke/pycharmprojects/aslevelhomeworkweek18/aslevelhomeworkweek18.py"", line 7, in random_number print(""%.2f"") % str typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'nonetype' and 'type' process finished with exit code 1"
