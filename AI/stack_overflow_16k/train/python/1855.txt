"why my for looping an index in blank not give me correct output i am new learner for blank.i am trying to make a basic login accout check, and somehow, my code is not showing what i want. i have defined three user name, and when i run my code, if the first time i put an incorrect user name, the code show account not exit,but it is not shoing. i do not know why..i believe it is my for loop problem, because when i input a wrong account, my i index start at 0 and keep loop until the end index and compare the input username and the exist username in the list. then after compare all the index if not found user name, then print account not exist, i try to fix this issue, but not find a correct way. ..user1=[  .   {'id':'0001','name':'123','password':'a123', 'balance':0.00},.   {'id':'0002','name':'456','password':'a456', 'balance':0.00},  .   {'id':'0003','name':'789','password':'a789', 'balance':0.00}.]..for x in range(0,4):..    name = input('user name：').    for i in range(len(user1)):.        if name == user1[i]['name']:  .            password = input('password：').            if password == user1[i]['password']:  .                print(""success login"").        continue.        if name != user1[i]['name']:.            print(""account not exist, input new one"")...if i input wrong user name; it should show account not exist input new one, then i put user name 456 then will ask the correct password."
