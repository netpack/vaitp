"command line arguments with subprocess.popen i've gui where if i press a button ""process"" calls a blank script which needs one command line argument. so i used subprocess.popen like this:..subprocess.popen(['chbif /home/vnandak/work/vs30_cradle/sv000_sv000/cradle_vs30_dkaplus01_fwd_dl140606_fem140704_v00_mod1.bif'],shell=true)...chbif is the alias for the .py script..this works fine but now i want to choose a file of my choice by browsing using askfilename() func from tkfiledailog() module. how can i do this?..i thought of doing it like this:..def bifcall():.        name13= askopenfilename().        subprocess.popen(['chbif', name13],shell=true)...but if i use this it throws an error saying that it does'nt have one more command line argument which is the file name"
