"how to read one particular line from .txt file in blank? i know i can read the line by line with..datafile = open('myfile.txt', 'r').firstline = datafile.readline().secondline = datafile.readline().......i also know how to read all the lines in one go..datafile = open('myfile.txt', 'r').alllines =  datafile.read()...but my question is how to read one particular line from .txt file?..i wish to read that line by its index...e.g. i want the 4th line, i expect something like..datafile = open('myfile.txt', 'r').alllines =  datafile.readlinebyindex(3)"
