"attributeerror: 'file' object has no attribute 'append' i'm really new to this whole thing, so excuse the maybe stupid question, but i am too stupid to find the answer myself...i've got a list with links urls and timestamps and want to shorten the urls and save the result to a new file..but running..file = open('history.csv','r').clean = open('historyclean.csv','a')..for x in file:.    b = x.rsplit('/',1).    b.pop().        clean.append(b)...results in..    attributeerror: 'file' object has no attribute 'append'...and i can't find out why..i am using blank 2.7, if relevant..thanks in advance."
