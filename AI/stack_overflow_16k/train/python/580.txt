"adjust the size of boxplot so that label become clear i am plotting the box plot graph but the x-axis labels are overlapping to each other and graph is looking messy. i want to increase the width of graph so that labels become clear, but am unsure what methods to use. my code looks like:..df2=restaurant.boxplot(by ='item', column =['profit'], grid = true).df2.plot(kind='box', figsize=(20,15)).plt.savefig('finalboxplot.png', bbox_inches='tight').plt.show()...and the resulting graph looks like this"
