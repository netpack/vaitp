"removing punctuations from list items using blank from glob import glob.pattern = ""d:\report\shakeall\*.txt"".filelist = glob(pattern).def countwords(fp):.    with open(fp) as fh:.        return len(fh.read().split()).print ""there are"" ,sum(map(countwords, filelist)), ""words in the files. "" ""from directory"",pattern.import os.import re.import string.uniquewords = set([]).for root, dirs, files in os.walk(""d:\report\shakeall""):.    for name in files:.        [uniquewords.add(x) for x in open(os.path.join(root,name)).read().split()].wordlist = list(uniquewords)...this code counts the total number of unique and total words. however, the problem is, if i write len(uniquewords) , it shows unreasonable number because it recognizes for example, 'shake' 'shake!' 'shake,' and 'shake?' as different unique words..i've tried to remove punctuations from uniquewords by making the list and modifying it, everything failed. can anybody help me?"
