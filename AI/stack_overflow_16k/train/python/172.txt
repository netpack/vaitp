"get the `m` and others of `blankx.ym` (see this question for what the m means)..i need to construct the include path of .virtualenvs/foo/include/blankx.ym to compile something (i.e. -i...) against the virtualenv. i can get the x.y using sys.version or sys.final_version...how do i get the m to construct the include path?..edit: i tried sys.executable but that is pointing to .../foo/bin/blank, which is unhelpful for this."
