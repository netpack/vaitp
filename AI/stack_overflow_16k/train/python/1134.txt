"merge arrays in blank based on a similar value i want to merge two arrays in blank based on the first element in each column of each array...for example,..a = ([[1, 2, 3],.[4, 5, 6],.[4, 6, 7],.[5, 7, 8], .[5, 9, 1]])..b = ([[1, .002],.[4, .005],.[5, .006]])...so that i get an array..c = ([[1, 2, 3, .002],.[4, 5, 6, .005],.[4, 6, 7, .005],.[5, 7, 8, .006],.[5, 9, 1, .006]])...for more clarity:..first column in a is 1, 4, 4, 5, 5 and.first column of b is 1, 4, 5..so that 1 in a matches up with 1 in b and gets .002..how would i do this in blank? any suggestions would be great."
