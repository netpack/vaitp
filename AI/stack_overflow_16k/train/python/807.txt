"how to modify positions of a list that don't exist? i have a list and cannot use numpy (from a hacker rank question). i want to store an array containing indexes of the elements in another array (to enable sorting). ..this array gets filled when i am doing binary search and find other things that are not my target. ..how can i fill the 10th position of a list for example, when it is empty ( the first 9 can be garbage, if need be)."
