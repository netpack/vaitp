"conditionals when defining a tuple / list say i have a list x = ['a','b','c'] to conditionally add a term to this you could do:..if conditional:.    x.append('d')...but i can't do this for a tuple (x = ('a','b','c'))..for both cases is there a 'clean' way of conditional-alising items in a definition. pseudo code:..x = (.    'a',.    'b',.    'c',.    'd' if y,.    'e' if z,.)...the use case for this is a django installed_apps tuple and urlpatterns list."
