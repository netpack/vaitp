"insert a value to a sorted list via list comprehension blank i have an assignment to add a value to a sorted list using list comprehension.  i'm not allowed to import modules, only list comprehension, preferably a one liner.  i'm not allowed to create functions and use them aswell..i'm completely in the dark with this problem.  hopefully someone can help :)..edit: i don't need to mutate the current list. in fact, i'm trying my solution right now with .pop, i need to create a new list with the element properly added, but i still can't figure out much."
