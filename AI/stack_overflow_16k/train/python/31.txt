"blank .txt file is identifying one letter at a time instead of a word in a .txt first i wold like to say im a very basic programmer so if you can please try not to be complicated however anything is helpful...i have a .txt file to define a keyword list eg:..pig,dog,cat...my real list is much bigger but has the same format...i want the user to input something and if the program detects one of the words which the user imputed and what the .txt file has it common it will give a response. if it doesn't find one of the words if gives a different response...start_question = str(input(""keywords are pig , cat , dog ""))...with open('d:program files (x86)blank programmingblank.txt'):.   if any(word in start_question for word in ('d:program files (x86)blankprogrammingblank.txt')):.   print (""yes"")...else:.    print (""no"")...now the file successfully opens but instead of finding words in comomon it finds letters in common. so if i input 'p' it will still say 'yes' however i want it to say no...thankyou."
