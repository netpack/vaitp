"blank: programatically add a specific number of spaces to the beginning of a string i need to add spaces to the beginning of a string based on a character entered by the user. ..for example. if the user entered 5, then 5 spaces would need to be added to the beginning of the string. ..i realise i can do this with a loop, but this seams like quite a bit of code, is there a ore blankic method to achieve this?"
