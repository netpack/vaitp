"using __contains__ on a list of custom class objects i have a simple class defined like this:..class user(object):.    def __init__(self, id=none, name=none):.        self.id = id.        self.name = name..    def __contains__(self, item):.        return item == self.id...using this class, i can do simple checks of single instances of the class like so:..&gt;&gt;&gt; user1 = user(1, 'name_1').&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in user1.true.&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 in user1.false...this is working as expected. ..how can i check if a value is in a list of user objects though? it always seems to return false...example:..from random import randint.from pprint import pprint.users = [user(x, 'name_{}'.format(x)) for x in xrange(5)].pprint(users, indent=4)..for x in xrange(5):.    i = randint(2,6) .    if i in users:.        print(""user already exists: {}"".format(i)).    else:.        print(""{} is not in users list. creating new user with id: {}"".format(i, i)).        users.append(user(i, 'new_user{}'.format(i))).pprint(users, indent=4)...this creates output similar to this:..[   0 =&gt; name_0, .    1 =&gt; name_1, .    2 =&gt; name_2, .    3 =&gt; name_3, .    4 =&gt; name_4].6 is not in users list. creating new user with id: 6.6 is not in users list. creating new user with id: 6.6 is not in users list. creating new user with id: 6.3 is not in users list. creating new user with id: 3.3 is not in users list. creating new user with id: 3.[   0 =&gt; name_0,.    1 =&gt; name_1,.    2 =&gt; name_2,.    3 =&gt; name_3,.    4 =&gt; name_4,.    6 =&gt; new_user6,.    6 =&gt; new_user6,.    6 =&gt; new_user6,.    3 =&gt; new_user3,.    3 =&gt; new_user3]...the issue is that the user with id 6 should have only been created 1 time, because it wasn't created already. the second and third time that 6 was attempted, it should have failed. the user would id 3 shouldn't have been recreated at all because it was part of the initialization of the users variable...how do i modify by __contains__ method to be able to properly utilize in when comparing against multiple instances of my class?"
