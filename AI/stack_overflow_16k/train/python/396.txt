"given a subset of attributes on a class instance, increment one randomly i have a blank class as such:..class zoo:.  pandas = 0.  tunas = 0.  cows = 0..  #...other attributes and methods below...because of divine forces outside of my control, i cannot modify the class in any way whatsoever (yes, i realize a dictionary of animals would be better here). i would like to write code which will operate on an instance of the class, and increment a random attribute amongst the 3 shown above by 1...in essence, i'd like to write something like this:..import random.z = zoo().attributes = [z.pandas, z.tunas, z.cows].random.choice(attributes) += 1...of course, this doesn't work. how would one go about doing this?"
