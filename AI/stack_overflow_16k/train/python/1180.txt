"how do you cacculate avg of a list i have a list called slopes and trying to calculate the overall avg values in the list like this:.. over_all_slope=float(sum(slopes))/float(len(slopes))...i get this error:..unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'nonetype'...looks like in my slopes list there values like none, now could i calculate the avg not including none values in the forumula?..any ideas?"
