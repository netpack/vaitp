how to check if there are duplicates words in a file i need to return true if any duplicates in the file. this is what i have but is not correct. ..def duplicate(filename):.    infile = open(filename).    contents = infile.read().    infile.close().    words = contents.split().    for word in words:.        if words.count(word) &gt; 1:.            return true.        else:.            return false...file contents ..this is a file with a duplicate. just one..you may try to find another but you'll never see it.
