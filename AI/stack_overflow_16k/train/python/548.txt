"create multiple classes or multiple objects in blank? i have the following problem and i need advice on how to solve it the best technically in blank. as i am new to programming i would like to have some advice. ..so i will have the following object and they should store something. here is an example:...object 1: cash dividends (they will have the following properties)...exdate (will store a list of dates).recorddate (will store a list of dates).paydate (will store a list of dates).isin (will store a list of text)..object 2: stocksplits (they will have the following prpoerties)...stockplitratio (will be some ration).exdate(list of dates)........i have tried to solve it like this: ..class cashdividends(object):..    def __init__(self, _gross,_net,_isin, _paydate, _exdate, _recorddate, _frequency, _type, _announceddate, _currency):.        self.gross = _gross.        self.net = _net.        self.isin = _isin.        self.paydate = _paydate.        self.exdate = _exdate.        self.recorddate = _recorddate.        self.frequency = _frequency.        self.type = _type.        self.announceddate = _announceddate.        self.currency = _currency...so if i have this i would have to create another class named stockplits and then define an __init__ function again. ..however is there a way where i can have one class like ""corporate actions"" and then have stock splits and cashdividends in there ?"
