"want to return the number of rows in matrix with all zeros in blank i wanted to return a output which is the number of rows with all zero in its elements. here is my blank code, and i couldn't identify where is the bug. ..def find_bully_1(a):..    n = len(a).    candidate = 0.    count = 0...    for i in range(n):.        for j in range(n):.            if a[i][j] == 0:.                count = count + 1.        if count == n:.            candidate = candidate + 1.    return candidate.....x = [[1,1,1,1],. [0,0,0,0],. [0,0,0,0],. [0,1,0,0]]...find_bully_1(x)..the output should be 2 but it keeps return 1."
