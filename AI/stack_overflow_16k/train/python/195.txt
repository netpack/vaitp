"blank, functions changing values so i am having trouble getting this system to work, and i can't be sure that i'm asking the right question, but here is what is happening and what i want to happen. ..money = 1.def stats():.     print.     print ""money "" + str(money)..def gainm():.     money + 2.     stats()..if money == 1:.     gainm()...now what happens when it goes to print money, the value is still 1 even though i add 2 to the value. (code is not a copy of my actual program, but an example to show what is happening.)"
