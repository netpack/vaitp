"make a package work as just one import i have a package in my project containing many *.py source files (each consisting of one class in most cases, and named by the class). i would like it so that when this package is imported, all of the files in the package are also imported, so that i do not have to write..import package.someclass.someclass.import package.someotherclass.someotherclass.import ......just to import every class in the package. instead i can just write..import package...and every class is available in package, so that later code in the file can be:..my_object = package.someclass()...what's the easiest way of doing this in __init__.py? if different, what is the most general way of doing this?"
