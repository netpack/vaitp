"learning blank: is there a better way to write words + vars to file? for example, the following code:..#!/usr/bin/env blank..cliente = 'teste'.servidor_virtual = '10.2.192.115'.porta = '22'.conf = ""# pool "" + cliente + 'n' ""virtual_server"" + servidor_virtual + porta + 'n'    .f = open('cliente.conf', 'w').f.write(conf).f.close()...i'm beginning at blank and creating a model to write some confs to a file..i just found this way, but i want to know if there another more elegant way to do this..and i want to mix word with variables values too."
