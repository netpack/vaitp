"blank 3 rock, paper, scissors issue i am working on a rock, paper, scissors game for a programming homework assignment and i have run into a little snag. the program is suppose run by the user selecting 1 of 4 options, 1) rock, 2) paper, 3) scissors and 4) quit. once the player selects an option the computers selection is displayed and the winner is announced and the program will ask if you would like to play another game. if y is select you go back to the main menu to choose another option, anything else will bring up the amount of games won, lost and how many games ended in a tie. if the player selects 4 the program should say ""exiting program..."" and the game results should display...here are my issues:...once you make the first selection, the winner is displayed and the program returns to main menu. if you make a second selection it will inform you of what the computer chose and then ask if you would like to play again. y will take you back to the main menu, the computers selection will never change and no matter what you select the game will always end in the same result as the very first game. if you choose not to play again then the amount of games won, lost and tied will appear (this seems to be functioning correctly)..the quit option takes you back to the main menu instead of displaying the game results. i am not sure where to put that if statement....any help with these issues would be appreciated...thank you..#import module.import random..def main():.    #create a variable to control the loop.    play_again = 'y'..    #create a counter for tied games, computer games and player games.    tied_games = 0.    computer_games = 0.    player_games = 0..    #display opening message.    print(""let's play rock, paper scissors!"") ..    computer_choice = process_computer_choice()..    player_choice = process_player_choice()..    winner = determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice)..    #setup while loop for playing multiple games.    while play_again == 'y' or play_again == 'y':..        process_computer_choice()..        process_player_choice()..        #use a if else statement to print the computers choice.        if computer_choice == 1:.            print('computer chooses rock.')..        elif computer_choice == 2:.            print('computer chooses paper.')..        else:.            print('computer chooses scissors.')..            #call the determine winner function    .            determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice)..        #check who won the game and add 1 to the correct counter.        if winner == 'computer':.            computer_games += 1..        elif winner == 'player':.            player_games += 1..        else:.            tied_games += 1..        #ask the user if they would like to play again    .        play_again = input('would you like to play again?
