"blank 'print' function 'sep' parameter is not working as expected i am using blank version 3.7.4 on windows 10 enterprise...i am facing a weird issue with blank's print function and especially sep parameter. ..in blank repl, when i use code print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, sep='t'), i get proper output as 1    2    3    4    5..however when code tries to iterate over a collection as shown below, instead of showing number separated by a tab, it always displays individual value on a new line...numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.for n in numbers:.    print(n, sep='t')...can someone please help me to understand why its displaying number value on a separate line? ..i have attached screenshot for the reference.....thanks."
