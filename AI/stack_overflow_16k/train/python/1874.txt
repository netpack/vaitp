"splitting blank 1d array into 2d array by comma i'm relatively new to blank (experience in c#), and i have a list in a text file that i dumped into a list using;..with open(fname) as f:.    content = f.readlines().content = [x.strip() for x in content] ...the thing is, every line is in the form xxxxx, xxxxx (with varying lengths of xxxxx), and i want to convert f into a 2-dimensional array with things in the line before the comma in the first dimension and everything after in the second...what's the best practice for doing something like that?"
