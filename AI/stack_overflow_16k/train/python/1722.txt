"try except and programming etiquette i'm making a gui and i'm finding myself to be using a lot of try except statements.  my question is, should i be redesigning my program to use less try except statements or is try except a good practice to be using in blank programs?  i like them because they're informative and make debugging, for me, easier.  just wondering what real developers think about it...thanks"
