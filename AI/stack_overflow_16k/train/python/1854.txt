how to use inputs in loops i created a code that shows the digits in the fibonacci sequence. i want a way to allow the user to enter the number of numbers shown. this is my code:..total = 1.total2 = 0.for i in range (*number of numbers/2*):.    total = total + total2.    print (total).    total2 = total + total2.    print (total2).#shows golden ratio.total3 = total2/total.print (total3)...can someone help me? it would be great!
