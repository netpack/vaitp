"how to detect change in hour of system time i am trying to make a program in blank that beeps every hour. and no of beeps should be equal to no of hours. such as for 12 o'clock it should beep 12 times...but i have no idea how to detect change in hour. ..def bep(h):.    for i in range(h):.        winsound.beep(2000,800).        sleep(2)...the above code beeps for h no of times and ..def hour():.    return hour=int(time.ctime(time.time()).split()[3].split(':')[0])...it gives the hour..but how to detect that hour has changed...whether should i check every regular time interval and use previous hour and current hour to detect changes? i think this idea is not effective. because of time delay of interval time i.e..check current time every 5 second and compare two successive check to detect change in hours..is there any method to accomplish it directly."
