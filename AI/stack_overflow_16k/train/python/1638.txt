"decimal to binary function, blank i am trying to created a function that takes in a decimal represented value and converts it into binary represented value...assuming the argument is always an integer:..import math..def binary_decimal_converter(x):..    binary_representation = 0.    number = x..    while number != 0:.        n = 1.        while x not in range(n,n*2):.            n *= 2.        binary_representation += 10**(int(math.log(n,2))).        number -= n..    return binary_representation...the problem:..if x is in the list below, the program runs normally...[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128....]...but if any other number is used, the program gets stuck in an unbreakable loop...why the loop:..while number != 0: #line 24  ...cannot run twice?"
