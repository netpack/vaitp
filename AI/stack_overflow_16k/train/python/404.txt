"or operator not working as expected, had to substitute for .upper method i'm making a weight converter between kgs and lbs. i first started as you see in approach 1, which worked but i wanted it to be non-case-sensitive between the k and k (for kgs) and similarly for l and l (for lbs.)..[approach 2] ..so i tried using ""l"" or ""l"" &amp; ""k"" or ""k"" in the statements, but it just broke. even when i input something in kgs, weight is multiplied by 0.45 and shows me a value in kgs...finally, i had to use the .upper method to capitalize the unit and check with the l or k when i run the code...i'm using pycharm and it's just a beginning project..#code..# variable initialisation.weight = float(input(""weight: "")).unit = input(""(l)bs or (k)gs: "")..#approach 1.if unit == ""l"":.    print(f""your weight in kilograms is {weight * 0.45} kgs"").elif unit == ""k"":.    print(f""your weight in pounds is {weight / 0.45} lbs"")..#approach 2.if unit == ""l"" or ""l"":.    print(f""your weight in kilograms is {weight * 0.45} kgs"").elif unit() == ""k"" or ""k"":.    print(f""your weight in pounds is {weight / 0.45} lbs"")..# approach 3.if unit.upper() == ""l"":.    print(f""your weight in kilograms is {weight * 0.45} kgs"").elif unit.upper() == ""k"":.    print(f""your weight in pounds is {weight / 0.45} lbs"")...when i input 48 for weight and k representing kgs, i get the output as 21.6kgs when it's supposed to be 106.67 lbs. using approach 2 while it works perfectly for approaches 1 &amp; 3..can anyone help with why?"
