"list slicing start and end string = ""abcdefgh""...can anyone explain why in string[start:end:stride]  the start always starts from 0 while end starts with 1...for example.string[0:3:1] outputs the result as ""abc"". as you can see i said end = 3 so shouldn't the string[0:3:1] be ""abcd"" because computer read 0 first?..and one more thing why: i don't get a result for .string[0:8:-1]. shouldn't it be ""hgfedcba""? i don't know if it is wrong syntax or not but i can print the result of string[::-1]."
