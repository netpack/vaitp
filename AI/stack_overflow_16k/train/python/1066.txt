"how to judge a paragraph in automatic abstract? i am programming an automatic abstract algorithm with blank..now i try to find the first sentence of each paragraph.so i have to divide each paragraph..i came out with an idea that split the paragraph with newline symbols.for example,'n'..but it may not work each time.i am afraid the result vary from different platform..is there a better way to judge a paragraph?"
