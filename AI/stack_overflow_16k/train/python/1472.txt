"blank error too many arguements i am writing a program to create, change, and solve a 15-puzzle and i'm stuck on what i assumed would be the easy part. so i have a board class that creates a solved 15-puzzle by default. then i have a set_board function that takes 16 integers and puts them into the puzzle instead of the defaults. but when i run the function it says that i provided too many arguments( set_board() takes exactly 16 arguments (17 given)) even though i entered the integers 0 through 16(* here takes the place of zero so it is easy to see). either i'm seeing things from staring at the screen for too long or i'm misunderstanding something. can someone help?..    def set_board(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p):.        self.board = [[a, b, c, d], [e, f, g, h], [i, j, k, l], [m, n, o, p]]...and in the shell: ..    board.set_board('*', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)..    traceback (most recent call last):.      file ""&lt;pyshell#20&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;.        board.set_board('*', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).    typeerror: set_board() takes exactly 16 arguments (17 given)"
