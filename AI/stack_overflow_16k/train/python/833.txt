"in blank, what does it mean for a function to be ""total""? i'm taking an mit opencourse thingy and there's this code in their first quiz...def f(s):.    d = {}.    for c in s:.        if c in d.keys():.            d[c] += 1.        else: d[c] = 1.    print d.    x = none.    for k in d.keys():.        if x == none:.            x = d[k].            y = k.        elif d[k] &gt; x:.            x = d[k].            y = k.    return y...the question in question is:...  is f total, i.e., defined for all values of s of type str?...i'm thinking that f is total because anything in a string, including numbers and special characters, can be put through the code. am i even close?"
