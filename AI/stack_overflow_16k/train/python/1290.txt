"printing from a list of lists what is the best way to print elements from a list of lists? i have a list that looks like this:..l1 = [['hello', 'world', 'bye'], ['name', 'tour', 'now']]...i would like to print from this, element by element, so something like:..hello name.world tour.bye now...i was thinking of using a while loop, something like:..while i &lt; 3:.    print(l1[0][i], l1[1][i]).    i -= 1...but instead of providing the [0] and [1], i would personally prefer it to be coded for a general case."
