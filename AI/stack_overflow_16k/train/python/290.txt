"blank: how to share a variable between two modules i have viewed some other threads that address the problem but not quite get it. ..suppose i have a config file that contains a shared variable:..config.py..flag = false...test1.py..import config.while(1):.    config.flag = true.    print config.flag...test2.py..import config.while(1):.    config.flag = false.    print config.flag...if now i run test1.py and test2.py, can i see the switch between 'true' 'false' in the output? i don't care about synchronization at this point, as long as it can access the shared variable, then it's done...thanks."
