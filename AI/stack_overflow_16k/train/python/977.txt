"blank) combing three textfiles(lists) into one with sorting i'm trying to make a new text file which is combined with 3 different text files. i'll give more detail with codes...text a file = z.              a.              y..text b file = s.              x.              d..text c file = 1.              3.              2...so there are a,b,c text files, and i want to make :..text newfile: z s 1.              y d 2.              a x 3...as you can see above, i want newfile to be in order of 'c' file..below is what i've been made...def main():.a = open(""text1"",""r"").b = open(""text2"",""r"").c = open(""text3"",""r"").text1list = [].text2list = [].text3list = [].for line1 in a:.    line1 = line1.strip().    text1list.append(line1).for line2 in b:.    line2 = line2.strip().    text2list.append(line2).for line3 in c:.    line3 = line3.strip().    text3list.append(line3).aa,bb,cc = zip(*sorted(zip(text3list, text1list, text2list))).combine = list(zip(bb,cc,aa)).with open(""finalfiles"", 'w') as zzzz:.    for item in combine:.        zzzz.write(""{}n"".format(item))...problem is, right now, my output is..('z','s','1').('y','d','2').('a','x','3')...my sorting is working, but it's different from what i expect..i don't want those ' ' and (). i think it's because those are lists...?.i'm stuck at this point..plus, please tell me my sorting looks fine !"
