"using random.choice in conjuction with if statements so i'm really new to programming, i just started learning blank yesterday and i'm having a little trouble.  i've looked through a few tutorials and haven't come up with how to answer my question on my own, so i'm coming to you guys...quicklist = [""string1"", ""string2""].anotherlist1 = [""another1a"", ""another1b""].anotherlist2 = [""another2a"", ""another2b""]..for i in range(1):.    quick=random.choice(quicklist).    another1=random.choice(anotherlist1).    another2=random.choice(anotherlist2)...what i want to do is write the code so that if quick turns up string1, it will print string1 and then print another1, but if quick generates string2, it will print string2 and then an entry from anotherlist2...any hints?..thanks in advance for your help!"
