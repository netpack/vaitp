"confusion on notation in documentation --blank the iter() method creates an object which can be iterated one element at a time...these objects are useful when coupled with loops like for loop, while loop...the syntax of iter() method is:..iter(object[, sentinel])...as an example using the sentinel bit of this code..with open('mydata.txt') as fp:.    for line in iter(fp.readline, ''):.        processline(line)...and so the stop value is a blank line. but the , inside the [ ] array notation is confusion. clearly the , comes between the object in the sentinel in my example and what would be more a complex example of code that would clarify this kind of use of a sentinel?"
