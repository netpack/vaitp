"error in getting results 1-st attempt.let's say a would like to see the chi_squared coefficient between two variables. i have implemented it such manner: ..import scipy.x=data['v288'].values.y = data['v780'].values.table = pd.crosstab(x,y)..from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency.chi2,p , dof, expected = chi2_contingency(table.values).print  % (chi2, p)...after, i get this error: ..typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'builtin_function_or_method' and 'tuple'...2-nd attempt .but, when i print this way, i don't get error: ..print   (chi2, p)...output: ..696.522768537 0.882613269189...i would like to understand, how to get results the way i've described in ""1-st"" attempt. and how can i interpret the results i already have..thank you!"
