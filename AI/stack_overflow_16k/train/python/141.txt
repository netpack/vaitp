"want to do calculation on dataframe's colums in blank and than the adding that result to the same datafram as a new colum here are the colums in dataframe..wants to perform these calculations ..active energy per mint = global_active_power*1000/60 - sub_metering_1 - sub_metering_2 - sub_metering_3...here is code which i wrote but not getting how to do that...import numpy as np.import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.import pandas as pd..# importing the dataset.training_set = pd.read_csv('household_power_consumption.txt', delimiter = ';', low_memory=false).consumed_energy_every_minute = training_set.global_active_power * (100/60) - training_set.sub_metering_1 - training_set.sub_metering_2 - training_set.sub_metering_2 ...and than want to add that value column to the the dataframe."
