"is blank`s sysloghandler nonblocking? i am trying to create a blank script that well periodically connect to haproxy socket, send a ""show info"" command and exit. this script will be used along with keepalived in order to determine, through this script, when to switch master/slave servers. therefore, my goal is that my blank script been non-blocking.  ..within my script, i have initiated a sysloghandler to send to my local syslogd various messages (exceptions e.t.c). however, i don't know if sysloghandler is blocking or not."
