"division in blank an types i have a code which part of it looks like this,..a=(-1//2+(int(math.sqrt(1+8*t)))//2).if type(a)==int:.    print(t).    print(a)...the problem arises when i use ""/""  to get ""a"", .since i am using ""/"", i always get an extra decimal point. for example 5/5=1.0 or 4/2=2.0 etc, which blank interprets it as a float (i am using 3.6.5). hence whatever the result is my code stuck at line2...when i use // the same thing happens. i get 5/2=2 which its float actually but it appears as an integer. ..since my code depends on the type of this division how i can solve this problem?..a=(-1//2+(int(math.sqrt(1+8*t)))//2) its a actually the formula for finding the roots of the quadratic equation (where in the equation a=1 and b=1 and c=-2t for ax^2+bx+c) i need only the integer roots with positive values"
