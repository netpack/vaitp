"nested list with dictionary as content hi how can i loop through lst2 below, and get the dictionary elements in lst1 if the elements are a match...lst1 = [[(10, 70, {'a': 0.30}),.         (12, 82, {'b': 0.35})],.        [(11, 140, {'c': 0.54}),.         (99, 25, {'d': 0.57})].       ]..lst2 = [[(10, 70), (32, 25),(12,82)],.        [(1598, 6009), (11,140), (33,66), (99,25)].       ]...ie compare lst2 and if lst2 is in lst1 print the dictionary. ..outcome should look like so:..outcome = [[{'a': 0.30}, {'b':0.35}], [{'c': 0.54}, {'d':0.57}]]...thanks..sorry an update on this one would be if lst1 is not nested ie ..lst1 = [(10, 70, {'a': 0.30}),.        (12, 82, {'b': 0.35}),.        (11, 140, {'c': 0.54}),.        (99, 25, {'d': 0.57}).       ]..lst2 = [[(10, 70), (32, 25),(12,82)],.        [(1598, 6009), (11,140), (33,66), (99,25)].       ]...such that the same outcome will be arrived at"
