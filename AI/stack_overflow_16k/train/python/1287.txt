"how do i add different levels & a quit option to my guess a number game? so i'm a freshman in high school trying to figure out blank coding, and i need to make a guess a number game. ..my first level works fine, but i need to make it so it has 3 different levels, and a quit option. i don't understand these while loops. ..i'm really sorry if i posted something wrong or this is an already asked question, but any help would be much appreciated! ..here's my code so far:..import random.print(""let's play guess a number!"").mylevel=int(input(""would you like to play level 1, 2, 3, or quit?""))..if mylevel == 1:.    number1= random.randit(1,10).    guess1=int(input(""guess an integer from 1 to ten""))..while number1!=guess1:.    print.    if guess1&lt;number1:.                 print(""guess is too low"").                 guess1=int(input(""guess again! or would you like to quit?"")).                 #this is where i want to be able to quit.    elif guess1&gt;number1:.                 print(""guess is too high!"").                 guess1=int(input(""guess again! or would you like to quit?"")).                 #this is where i want to be able to quit.    if guess1==number1:.                print(""you guessed it!"")..if mylevel == 2:.nextumber2= random.randint (1,100).guess2=int(input(""guess an integer from 1 to 100""))..while number2!=guess2:.print..if guess2&lt;number2:.        print(""guess is too low!"").        guess2=int(input(""guess again!"")).elif guess2&gt;number2:.        print(""guess is too high!"").        guess2=int(input(""guess again!""))..print(""you guessed it!"")"
