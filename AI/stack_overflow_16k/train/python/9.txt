"combining map with zip through lambda i'm trying to write a function for adding 2d vectors. .i'm trying to combine the map() function, getting a list using the zip() function (which will zip 2 tuples)...this is the code:..a = (1, 2).b = (3, 4).c = list(map(lambda x, y: x+y, list(zip(a, b)))).print(c)...so the way i see it, zip(a, b) returns a zip object containing the following tuples: (1, 3), (2, 4). it is then converted to a list. i'm getting the following error:...  typeerror: () missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'...so my guess is that the lambda function is not taking the second number in each tuple...is there any way to do this?"
