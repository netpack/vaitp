"how do i use more than one special method ( eg object.__add__(self, other) ) in my class? say i had attributes that i regularly wanted to add (and i did so by adding the instances). when i only had one of these sets of attributes that i wanted to add, i used the __add__ method. .but now, if i have more than one, do i just make class methods, and not use this particular dunder method  (__add__)? ..class athlete():..    def __init__(self, name, num_throws, num_games, minutes_played):.        self.name = name.        self.num_throws = num_throws.        self.num_games = num_games.        self.minutes_played = minutes_played..# i was using below method to calculate the total number of throws for 2 athletes.    def __add__(self, other):.        return self.num_throws * other.num_throws..# but now i have another addition to calculate the total number of minutes played.    def __add__(self, other):.        return self.minutes_played * other.minutes_played..ath1 = athlete('john', 34, 19, 478).ath2 = athlete('jim', 32, 11, 260)..print(ath1 + ath2)...so, in the above case, is there any need to use __add__ at all? should i just be making my own methods that add stuff?"
