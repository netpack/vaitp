"i don't understand why the for loop is not working i'm running blank 3.7.3 on ubuntu 19.04 using visual studio code 1.39.1.  i'm a bit of a noob so please be patient with me.  ..i'm working my way through computation and programming using blank.  the authors give this example which i typed into vsc, i'm 99% sure, accurately, but it's not doing what the program is supposed to, namely finding the intersection of two lists:..def intersect(l1,l2):.    tmp = [].    for e1 in l1:.        for e2 in l2:.            if e1 == e2:.                tmp.append(e1).                break.            result = [].            for e in tmp:.                if e not in result:.                    result.append(e).            return result..s = [2,3].t = [2,3,4].intersect(s,t)...the output is [2] rather than [2,3], so it seems like the program is not running through s, but i can't figure out why...thank you in advance."
