"how this blank code works that stores all text files in a list i am a beginner of blank. i am working on a practice that copy all text files's content to a spreadsheet, the following code will store will text files in certain folder to a list object:..path="".\excel spreadsheets""..text_files = [filename for filename in os.listdir(path) if filename.endswith("".txt"")]...i have a hard time to understand how second line works, since in the text book, i only see the example like:..for filename in os.listdir():.    if filename.endswith('.txt'):.       os.unlike(filename) #...do something.....i mean i only know how second code works, like loops via a path, and the if statement check the text files, then do something....but the first code is too compressed for me, is it possible to break it into a simple or more logic way?"
