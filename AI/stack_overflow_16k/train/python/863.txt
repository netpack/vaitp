"best practices when matching large number of files against large number of regex strings i have a directory with several thousand files. i want to sort them into directories based on file name, but many of the file names are very similar. ..my thinking is that i'm going to have to write up a bunch of regex strings, and then do some sort of looping. this is my question:..is one of these two options more optimal than the other? do i loop over all my files, and for each file check it against my regexs, keeping track of how many match? or do i do the opposite and loop over the regex and touch each file? ..i had though to do it in blank, as thats my strongest language, but i'm open to other ideas."
