"blank list comprehension and lowercase i have a dictionary that has mixed case values.  i do not want to change everything to lowercase but what i want to do is use dictionary comprehension to get the values out but have those values be lowercase.  ..employeeids = [employee.get('externalemployeeid', '') for employee in activeemployees]...at the moment this is returning mixed case in the employeeids result.  i know i can go to a more traditional for loop - but i am curious if i can make this convert to lowercase, also.  i can't just put .lower() after the paren because it can return none which does not support lowercase.  and i could put ' ' instead of '' in this specific case but it seems to me i should be able to put some kind of expression here instead of just the .get?"
