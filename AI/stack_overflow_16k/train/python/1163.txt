"calculate average of list values grouped by second list i didn't know how to better express myself in the title. basically what i have is two lists:..a = ['a','b','a','c','d','c','a',...] .b = [2,4,8,3,5,2,1,...]...a and b have the same length, b represents a value related to the letter in a ...now i would like to calculate the average value in b for each letter in a. so at the end i would have:..a = ['a','b','c','d',...].b = [3.67, 4, 2.5, 5,...]...is there a standard implementation for this in blank?"
