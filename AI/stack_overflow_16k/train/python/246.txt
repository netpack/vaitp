"changing the default blank without changing the $path variable? i want to change the default blank version i use, without affecting any other defaults. appending the blank path to the $path environment variable only accomplishes that as long as there is only the blank executable at that given location, which is not the case if i want to use the /usr/bin version (export path=usrbin:$path). ..i know i could theoretically create a symbolic link in some other folder of my choosing, but this is not very elegant...is there any other way of changing the default blank (like a nice environment variable that blank uses which takes precedence over the $path environment variable)?"
