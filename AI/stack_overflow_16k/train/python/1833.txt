"what goes underneath of monkey patch in blank i'm a bit confused and trying to understand what goes underneath in the hope that i would understand monkey patch better. ..i've read where to patch and i understand that i have to patch from where you use the module. but in the documentation. ..a.py.    -&gt; defines someclass..b.py.    -&gt; from a import someclass.    -&gt; some_function instantiates someclass...if i do this from a import someclass ..then i have to patch like this...@patch('b.someclass')..however, why if i import the module like this. ..import a..i instead have to use the patch like this...@patch('a.someclass')..i only understand how to use the patch but i don't understand why is this the case? is it the way blank import module?"
