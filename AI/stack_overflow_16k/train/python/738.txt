"can not remove similar elements from two lists i have array one: a1 = [1,2,3], and array two: a2 = [1,2,3]. i have to compare these two arrays and remove all similar elements from a1. at the same time i have to return a1 and i can not use additional libraries these are requirements..i'm trying to do it in such way:..    for i in a1:.        for j in a2:.            if i == j:.                a1.remove(j)...the problem here that it returns [2] instead of [] (empty array)..ps. i know about the similar question, but i couldn't find solution there how to remove items from a list while iterating?"
