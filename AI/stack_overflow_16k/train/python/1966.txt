"make blank wait until a file exists before continuing in my code, i write a file to my hard disk. after that, i need to import the generated file and then continue processing it...for i in xrange(10):.    filename=generatefile().    # takes some time, i wish to freeze the program here.    # and continue once the file is ready in the system.    file=importfile(filename).    processfile(file)...if i run the code snippet in one go, most likely file=importfile(filename) will complain that that file does not exist, since the generation takes some time...i used to manually run filename=generatefile() and wait before running file=importfile(filename)..now that i'm using a for loop, i'm searching for an automatic way."
