"printing 5 words that last 3 letters are the same in blank my program should read the content of a text file and find similar words according to the last 3 characters and print out 5 of these similar words in any order. for ex: warm, arm, charm.....i write a code but i could not complete...def main():.    # an empty array.    my_dict = {}..    with open(""words.txt"", ""r"") as f:.        for line in f:..            for word in line.strip().split("" ""):.                s = word[-3:].                if s not in my_dict:.                    # add 3 letters as the key.                    my_dict[s] = [].                my_dict[s].append(word)..                if len(my_dict[s]) == 5:.                    print(my_dict[s]).                    return..        # this will only print if there are no 3 words with the same start letters.    print(my_dict).print(main())...my output is ..{'ger': ['finger'], 'iss': ['premiss'], 'arm': ['arm'], 'ike': ['like']}"
