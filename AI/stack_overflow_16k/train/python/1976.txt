"lazy importing in blank tool suite context:.i am making a command line tool suite that will be launched much like git and all of it's tools. commands will be run like meke toolname --args..based on ""why lazy import is not default in blank?"" it sounds my case is one of the few useful places for lazy importing. i would like to parse the command line to get which tool the user would like to run, then import that tool and pass along the remaining arguments to it's main function...question: is this a good idea? are there reasons i should import everything up front instead? or perhaps there is a better way to structure the whole suite entry point?..i am pretty sure lazy imports will be better here. i figure a sanity check with you smart folks was a good way to prevent unforeseen complications or bad design practices. thanks."
