"manipulating a (very) long data file with blank i'm trying to write a code which manipulates a very long document (more than a million lines)..in this text file there are certain timestamps at regular intervals (every 1003 lines) and in between.there is the data i need, which is a 1000 lines long and a header and two blank lines, which i do not need...i want my code to take an input from the user between 1 and 1000 which refers to the timestamps and copy the corresponding chunk of lines into a separate txt...the code i've written works as expected if the input is '0', but doesn't provide any output if it's any other number...here is my code:..import sys..time = input()..output = open('rho_output_t' + str(time), 'w',)..sys.stdout = output..filepath = 'rho.xg'..l = 2       #lower limit of 0th interval..u = 1001    #upper limit of 0th interval..step = 1003..with open(filepath) as fp:..    for t in range(0, 1000):..        print(""{} "".format(t))  #this is only here so i can see the for loop running correctly..        for cnt, line in enumerate(fp):..            if int(time) == t and cnt &gt;= l+(step*int(time)) and cnt &lt;= u+(step*int(time)):..                print(""line {}: {}"".format(cnt, line))...output.close()...where did i mess up and how could i correct this?.thanks for the help in advance!"
