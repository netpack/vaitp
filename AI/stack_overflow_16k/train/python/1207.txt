"how to properly access dictionary keys from dictionaries stored in list? i am a complete beginner reading crash course blank by eric matthes. here is my code trying to access a dictionary key, with the dictionaries stored within the list shirts...red_shirt = {'shirt_color': 'red', 'shirt_price': 20}.blue_shirt = {'shirt_color': 'blue', 'shirt_price': 25}.green_shirt = {'shirt_color': 'green', 'shirt_price': 30}..shirts = [red_shirt, blue_shirt, green_shirt]..user_input = input('which shirt would you like to purchase?n:').for shirt in shirts:...so far i believe i have an issue with the for loop... should i be using a second for loop to access the keys within the dictionary?..    if shirt['shirt_color'] == 'red':.        #shirt_color = 'red'.        print('you bought the ' + shirt['shirt_color'] + ' shirt for $' + str(shirt['shirt_price']))...opposed to using k['v'] to access the values of the dictionary, i have also tried using .format...    elif shirt['shirt_color'] == 'blue':.        #shirt_color = 'blue'.        print('you bought the ' + shirt['shirt_color'] + ' shirt for $' + str(shirt['shirt_price'])).    elif shirt['shirt_color'] == 'green':.        #shirt_color = 'green'.        print('you bought the ' + shirt['shirt_color'] + ' shirt for $' + str(shirt['shirt_price'])).    else:.        print('it seems we do not have the shirt you are looking for, please try again')"
