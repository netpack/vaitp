"how do i turn a string into a variable name how can i turn a string, say 'a' into a variable name on which i can use the append function?..i am trying to take the input, which is made ut of only small letters of the alphabet and record the posision of the letter in the string with a number under a variable of the letters name. the problem i have encountered is that i have to turn the string that i have from the input into a variable name that i can use the append funtion on..i have tried using vars() after i saw it somewhere (don't really know what vars() does since i'm new to this). this worked fine sometimes, but not always..now i'm looking for a better way to do it...'''this is the code i have now. this does not work all the time'''.ord = input().count = 1.for i in ord:.    i = vars()[i].    i.append(count).    count = count + 1.    i = []"
