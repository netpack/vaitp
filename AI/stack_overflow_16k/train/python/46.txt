"why continue doesn't work while raising errors i'm trying to figure out why continue doesn't work when i'm rising errors:..while true:.        a = int(raw_input('type integer with 9 numbers ')).        if len(str(a)) &lt; 9 or len(str(a)) &gt;9:.                raise nameerror('wrong number. try again...').                continue.        if not istance(a, int):.                raise valueerror(""oops!  that was no valid number.  try again..."").                continue.        else:.                print a.                break...could you point out my mistake(s)?"
