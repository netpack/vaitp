"why does this code that uses .isalnum not work? name = """".name = input(""hi there, what is your name? "").while name.isalnum():.   name = input(""hi there, what is your name? "").while name.isdigit():.   name = input(""hi there, what is your name? "")...this is what the code looks like, but i only want it to accept letters only. when i run this code however, there is a problem and the program keeps asking for the user's name for any input provided, the only way the program continues is if a 'space (bar)' is pressed. what is wrong with this?"
