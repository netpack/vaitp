"write file path only one time even if there are more then one string with the file within a recursive search i'm doing a recursive search in a directory. every thing is happening accordingly except for the fact that my script is writing the file path for every string it finds within a file. i want the script to write the file's path only one time and move on the next file. ..here is the code:..srcn_path = input('   enter directory: ').files = os.walk(srcn_path).print ()..scrnumber = input('   enter scr number: ').print ()..for(path, dirs, files) in os.walk(srcn_path, topdown=true):.    for filename in files:.        filepath = os.path.join(path, filename).        with open(filepath, 'w') as currentfile:.            for line in currentfile:.                if scrnumber in line:.                    file = open(""tag_in_header.txt"", ""a"").                    file.write(filepath+' ""'+scrnumber+'"" foundn').                    file.close()...example of actual result of my code is:..d:dogcatdeer.txt string found.d:dogcatdeer.txt string found.d:dogcatliontigerpig.txt string found.d:dogcatliontigerpig.txt string found..expected result:..d:dogcatdeer.txt string found.d:dogcatliontigerpig.txt string found"
