"pool of warm, reusable blank processes my application polls an api repeatedly and spawns processes to parse any new data resulting from these calls, conditionally making an api request based on those data. the speed of that turnaround time is critical...a large bottleneck seems to be related to the setup of the actual spawned processes themselves -- a few module imports and normal instantiation code, which take up to 0.05 seconds on a middling amazon setup†. it seems like what it would be helpful to have a batch of processes with those imports/init code already done††, waiting to process results. what is the best approach to create/communicate with a pool (10-20?) of warm, reusable, and extremely lightweight processes in blank?..† - yes, i know throwing better hardware at the problem will help, and i'll do that too...†† - yes, i know doing less will help, and i'm working on making the code as streamlined and minimal as possible"
