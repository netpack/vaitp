"can't get my code to run properly (beginner) my task is to write a script that asks the user a question with a fixed number of possible answers.  heres what i have so far:..print(""who's your favorite actor: tom cruise, nicholas cage, or jonah hill?"").user_input = input().user_input = user_input.lower().while user_input != ""tom cruise"" or ""nicholas cage"" or ""jonah hill"":.    print(""no seriously, who's your favorite actor?: tom cruise, nicholas cage, or jonah hill"").    user_input = input().if user_input == ""tom cruise"" or ""nicholas cage"" or ""jonah hill"":.    print(""...thats your favorite actor..."")...everytime i run i get stuck in the while loop and keep getting asked ""no seriously, who's your favorite actor?: tom cruise, nicholas cage, or jonah hill"" i used the user_input.lower() because the input has to be case insensitve. any help would be very much appreciated!"
