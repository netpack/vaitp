"reading .csv file. i have a .csv file i need to loop over, and then inside a loop, i want to check the value of the next line every iteration. i can't seem to get it to work properly, as it skips the line i was looking ahead in the next iteration...import csv.file_object = open('file.csv', 'r').reader = csv.reader(file_object, delimiter = ';')..for line in reader:.    next_line = reader.next().    # it now reads the next line and doesn't iterate over it again in the next.    # iteration. however, i want it to still iterate over it in the next iteration....thank you very much!"
