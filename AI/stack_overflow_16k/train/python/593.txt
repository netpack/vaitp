"skip an element in zip i have two files that are zipped with something like the following:..for line in zip(open(file1), open(file2)):.    # do-something...unfortunately, now file2 has changed, and there is an additional line at the beginning. yes, i could get rid of that manually (or with an additional script/program), but since the actual number of involved files is huge, i'd prefer to solve the problem at this level...so, what i want is something like the following (which would be valid, if open(file) were subscriptable):..for line in zip(open(file1), open(file2)[1:]):.    # do-something"
