blank: is it possible to set a high score without a text file? i have recently made a game with blank that makes the user decipher an anagram and based on difficulty it increases their score. is there any way to implement a high score into this without the use of a text file?.the overall goal is for the program to compare the users score to the high score and if the score is greater it would edit the high score to the score gained. this would need to stay like that for the next run through of the program after i close it.
