"what's the effect of `pass` in blank debug mode i just found this phenomenon by coincidence. ..mylist = [('1',), ('2',), ('3',), ('4',)].for l in mylist:.    print(l).    pass    # first pass.pass        # second pass.print(""end"")...if i set the red stop point at the first pass and debug, the program will stop here and the output is:..('1',)..however, if i set the red stop point at the second pass and debug, the output include the end in the last line. it seems like the pass avoid stopping at this point and just let the program run further. ..i thought pass should have no real meaning, but it seems not. so how can understand the pass?..thank you all"
