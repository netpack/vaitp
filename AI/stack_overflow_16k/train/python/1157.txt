"what is pattern blank i've been programming in java for the past year and this weekend i decided to throw myself in the deep-end and build a text-classifier in blank3. while naturally there's syntax distinction, there's a lot of conceptual similarities that i'm familiar with. however, i've come across pattern, something i've yet to encounter in java. ..i've done some research and understand it relates to design-patterns, the 23 gof, patterns allow for reusability of code and improves interactions with objects etc. but i don't understand how patternis used in this following block of code. for context, the text-classifier is looping through each sentence in the training data, manipulating the pre-instantiated lists, words, classes and documents. here's the link to what i'm following - https://machinelearnings.co/text-classification-using-neural-networks-f5cd7b8765c6..for pattern in training_data(pattern['sentence']).    words.extend(w).    documents.append((w, pattern['class'])).    if pattern['class'] not in classes:.        classes.append(pattern['classes'])...cheers for your help!"
