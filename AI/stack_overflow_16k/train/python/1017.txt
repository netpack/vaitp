"reading to a text file that does not have the text extension "".txt"" i am trying to read a file in blank 3.8 that is has the extension "".input"". however, it is meant to be read as a text file. i tried to connect to the file using this code:..file = open('file.input', 'r').print(""the contents of the file are:"",file)...however, it does not output the contents of ""file.input"" (i wrote ""hello world"" in there as a sample message)."
