"is it possible to replace blank import command? i have a strange requirement. i can't install (or compile) blank-fabric module on machine (at workplace). i was wondering is it possible to copy the entire source code of fabric as single file and paste into a my file (something like ""sqlite amalgamation"") ? does that work ?..-> get the source of fabric module. .-> copy all files content of this module in to file (singlefile.py).-> now import this singlefile.py on my myfile.py..any thoughts?  (lets assume, the dependencies like paramiko,pycrypto already available on workplace)."
