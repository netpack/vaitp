"how to remove first row and first column from a matrix-like dataset i have constructed eigenvector matrix using r and output it in a file that looks like this:.."""",""values"",""vectors.1"",""vectors.2"",""vectors.3"",""vectors.4"",""vectors.5"",""vectors.6"".""1"",5,0.49,0.40,-0.577,0,0.28,-0.4.""2"",4,0,-0.40,0.283,0.5,0.577,-0.4.""3"",3,-0.5,0.4,0.28,-0.5,0.28,-0..""4"",3,0.5,-0.4,0.28,-0.5,-0.28,-0.4.""5"",1,-0.5,-0.4,-0.57,0,-0.28,-0.4.""6"",0,0,0.4,0.28,0.5,-0.57,-0.4...i want to remove the first row and first column to extract the matrix itself and store it in another file (i believe you cannot do read and write in the same file you open). hence, i tried the following but i don't know how to proceed. appreciate any help...with open('./test.csv', 'r') as csvfile, open('./output.csv', 'w') as outputfile:.    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter='t').    for line in reader:.        print line[0][3:]"
