"why is my file closing and causing ""i/o operation on closed file"" error on line 51? i am relatively new to blank and have been trying to write a ""to-do list"" program over the past few days. today i was working on a delete function for removing tasks from the list but i have been getting this error on line 51 where it says ""f.write(line)"" and i'm not sure why. the ""integer.txt"" is a text file that just starts at one and stores the next value on the list and ""tododata.txt"" stores the actual data. any help would be appreciated...p.s. i realize this code is not very eloquent.....import csv.import pandas as pd..exit = false.hasopened = false..rownum = 1.with open('integer.txt', 'r') as f:.  a = f.read().  b = list(a).  rownum = int(b[0])..print("" to-do list"")..while exit is false:.  entry = input(""what would you like to do?n a) addn d) deleten e) editn r) readn q) quitnn"")..  if entry is 'a':.    #this will add an item to the list.    with open('tododata.txt', 'a') as data:.      csv_writer = csv.writer(data).      csv_writer.writerow([rownum, input('what would you like to add?nn')]).    print(""successfully added!n"").    rownum += 1.    with open('integer.txt', 'w') as count:.      csv_writer = csv.writer(count).      csv_writer.writerow([rownum]).  elif entry is 'd':.    #this will delete an item from the list.    with open('tododata.txt','r') as data:.      csv_reader = csv.reader(data).      print(data.read()).    deletionkey = input('which number would you like to delete?n').    deletionnum = int(deletionkey).    if deletionnum &lt;= rownum and deletionnum &gt; 0:.      with open(""tododata.txt"", ""r"") as f:.        lines = f.readlines().      with open(""tododata.txt"", ""w"") as f:.        for line in lines:.          if line[0] != deletionkey:.            value = line[0].            nwvalue = value.strip().            nwvalue = int(nwvalue).            if nwvalue &gt; deletionnum:.              oldnum = nwvalue.              oldnumstr = str(oldnum).              newnum = nwvalue - 1.              newnumstr = str(newnum).              d = line.lstrip(oldnumstr).              line = newnumstr + d.              f.write(line).              with open(""integer.txt"", ""r"") as f:.                position = f.readline().                position = int(position) - 1.                position = str(position).              with open(""integer.txt"", ""w"") as f:.                f.write(position).            else:.              f.write(line).    else:.      print('please enter a valid list number.').  elif entry is 'e':.    #this will edit an item on the list.    print(""edit"").  elif entry is 'r':.    #this will read the to-do list.    with open('tododata.txt','r') as data:.      csv_reader = csv.reader(data).      print(data.read()).  elif entry is 'q':.    break.  else:.    print('please enter a valid value.
