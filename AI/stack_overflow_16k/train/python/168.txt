"blank calling function with only necessary parameters? say i have a function:..def omni(self, func, *args, **kwargs):...that always calls func...however, func's parameters can be any combination of things. for example..def func(self):.    # omni should only pass in self..def func():.    # omni should pass in nothing..def func(foo, key='foo'):.    # omni should pass in a foo param and a key if supplied one..def func(*args, **kwargs):.    # omni should pass in everything...is there any way to pass into func from omni only the necessary parameters? i.e. is the above possible?..ex...def foo(m):.    pass..obj.omni(foo, m, a=1).# this should call.foo(m)..def foo(self, **kwargs):.    pass..obj.omni(foo, m, 1, b=2).# this should call.foo(self, b=2)"
