"extract data points from text i'd like to extract data from a sentence. i know that this is not a simple and easy process but was wondering what would be the best way about doing so. for example i'd have the sentence:..the silver boat moved through the dark waters, light by the moonlight....from that i'd like to get:..boat: sliver, moving through water //moving through water referring to water:.water: dark, light by the moonlight, boat moving //boat moving referring to boat:.moonlight: lighting water...basically i'd like to get all the words that describe the noun whether a single word or short phrase. some details are kept both twice (the item boat has a reference to water and the item water reference to boat)..i was thinking about getting a list of nouns and finding all them in the sentence. then i'd somehow get everything describing it (all the links)...if someone has already done something similar or if there's a way to get all related data from a sentence, please tell me or give a link."
