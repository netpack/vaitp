"infinite loops and inputting answers i'm creating a dice game and i'm trying to break out of this infinite loop. .fixed by putting str on input so again=str(input('roll again?')..import random..def play_again():.    again = input('would you like to roll again? ').    if again == 'y' or 'y':.        main().    if again == 'n' or 'n':.        print('exiting the game.')..def roll():.    print('rolling the dice.')..def exit():.    print('ending game.')..def result():.    print('the number is '+str(random.randint(1,6))+'.')..def main():.    roll().    result().    play_again()....main()...i know i could just put everything in one method, but i rather keep it the way it is. the program runs fine till it reaches play_again(). no matter what letter i press, it runs the program again. how would i fix it so it runs again if i press y and quit when i press n?"
