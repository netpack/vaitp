"closing a blank program window leaves program still running in the background i made a program, which uses tkinter to create a window where stuff happens. it contains images and loops to constantly shift and move the images...now, when i close the window, the scripts are still running and it creates error messages that it has nowhere to place the images with new coordinates...i think that the loops are still running. so my question is, how do i close the program all together after clicking the x on the window. is there a way to bind the x(close window) to terminate the program, or cat n ibe done inside a code, to see when the tkinter window is closed(to me this way seems to be bad, because it would keep checking for if the window is still existing or not)...thanks a lot!"
