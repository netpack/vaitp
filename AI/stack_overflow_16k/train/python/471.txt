"adding random generated numbers in blank i have to write a program that generates a list of random generated numbers. at the end of the list i need the total of the numbers. ..for example;.3, 5, 2, 1, 8..the total is 19. ..i'm not sure how to get the total of the generated numbers to appear, and to appear on the next line. ""the total is 19"" has to appear on the next line. thank you!..import random..def randnums():.    for count in range(6):.       number = random.randint(1, 6).       print(number, end="" "").randnums()"
