"why (num) from type list in my code take one value and if i add new value is replace old value ? because of this i can't get average i write code takes from user some numbers and get summation and average , my problem it is i can't add more than one value in my list (num) , it is just replace old value by new value ..class game_2_sum():.    print('welcome').    print('please enter number you want sum it , press x if you finish').    z=0.    num=[].    while true:.        try:.            inp=input().            if inp.__eq__('x'):.                break.            else:.                num=[float(inp)].            for x in num:.                z+=int(x).        except valueerror:.            print('please enter right number ').    print('total is {}'.format(z)).    print('average is {}'.format(z/len(num))).    print(num)....  i expect the output of summation (1,2,3) is 6 and average is 2.0.  .  but the actual output is average 6.0"
