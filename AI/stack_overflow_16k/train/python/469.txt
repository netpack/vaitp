"find_packages() not detecting files for blank egg i'm trying to build a blank egg file. my purpose is to bundle files in two locations. but it is bundling the files from only one location..so i have written the setup.py file..from setuptools import setup, find_packages.setup(.    name = 'sample',.    version = '1.0.0',.    namespace_packages=['com'],.    packages = find_packages(),.    description = 'sample code',.    author = 'xyz',.)...the setup.py file is in the location../root/sandy/blank/sample/setup.py...the com package is in the location../root/sandy/sandy/com/sample.py...i have __init__.py files in the following directories../root/sandy/sandy/__init__.py./root/sandy/sandy/com/__init__.py...in the egg command i have specified the target directory a different location than /root/sandy/blank/sample/setup.py because i have to bundle files in some other directory. i see it is detecting the setup.py file correctly but not bundling the files from /root/sandy/sandy/com/..how can i specify to pick files from multiple locations for creating the egg?"
