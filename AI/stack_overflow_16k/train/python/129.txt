"blank path issue while importing my own modules. what is the best way to go about it? i've created blank modules but they are in different directories. ../xml/xmlcreator.py./tasklist/tasks.py...here, tasks.py is trying to import xmlcreator but both are in different paths. one way to do it is include xmlcreator.py in the blankpath. but, considering that i'll be publishing the code, this doesn't seem the right way to go about it as suggested here. thus, how do i include xmlcreator or rather any module that might be written by me which would be in various directories and sub directories?"
