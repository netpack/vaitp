"how can i use dic in blank to search values and get a key? .  hi, i'm new in blank. i want to do a meet in the middle attack (a.  task for the university) here's my situation. i have 5 files .  plaintext.txt = xxxx enctext.txt = yyyy files_description.  .  i want to find a pair of key considering that one string in.  encplain.txt have to be the same in deccipher.txt.  .  i add this values in a dictionary in blank and i have this.  encryption_dictionary {'18cba6e': 'd007603a0dad6e41', '18cba76': 'dc568dc3f8674d70'} dec_dictionary {'18cba7b': '4d7c2e7879e0e8ea',.  '18cba6c': '44f58706bec4b043'}.  .  how can i compare the values of this two dictionary in order to get.  the pair of keys in case that this two string are equal? sorry for my.  english.this is my code for now....import sys.dickeyenc = {}.dickeydec = {}.    def main():.        with open(sys.argv[1],'r') as key, .        open(sys.argv[2],'r') as encplain,.        open(sys.argv[3],'r') as deccipher:.            for i,j,k in zip(key,encplain,deccipher):.                i = i.strip().                j = j.strip().                k = k.strip().                dickeyenc[i]=j.                dickeydec[i]=k..        print (dickeyenc).        print (""n"").        print (dickeydec).main()"
