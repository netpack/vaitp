"determining implementation of blank at runtime? i'm writing a piece of code that returns profiling information and it would be helpful to be able to dynamically return the implementation of blank in use...is there a blankic way to determine which implementation (e.g. jython, pypy) of blank my code is executing on at runtime?  i know that i am able to get version information from sys.version:..&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys.&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.version.'3.4.3 (default, may  1 2015, 19:14:18) n[gcc 4.2.1 compatible apple llvm 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.49)]'...but i'm not sure where to look in the sys module to get the implementation that the code is running."
