"what is the sole purpose of int and .strip() when creating a variable for simple comprehension? my objective is to print a dictionary where the keys are the inputted numbers, and the values are the squares of those numbers. for example, if the index is my_list= 1, 2, 3, 4, then the script should print {1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16}...an attributeerror occurred saying: ...  'list' object has no attribute 'split'...i realized i need to define the list in order for me to split. .i did some research on how to define the list for simple comprehension and was told int(.split()) can be helpful. i'm assuming i need to convert the list into integers?..this is what i tried in the beginning:..print({num: num ** 2 for num in my_list.split()})"
