"'module' object has no attribute 'compose' related to this question, but i'm on a newer ubuntu and functools is installed but isn't working properly...i'm on ubuntu 16.04 64-bit, and whenever i try to do anything interesting in blank, it results in an error:.....something relevant to the actual application...... file ""/usr/lib/blank2.7/locale.py"", line 17, in &lt;module&gt;.     import functools   file ""/usr/local/lib/blank2.7/dist-packages/functools.py"", line 72, in. &lt;module&gt;.     globals()['c_%s' % x] = globals()[x] = getattr(_functools, x) attributeerror: 'module' object has no attribute 'compose'...this has been tried with conjure-up, robert and some actual blank code..what can i do to fix it?..the relevant part of my functools.py looks like this:..try:.    import _functools.except importerror:.    pass.else:.    for x in __all__:.        globals()['c_%s' % x] = globals()[x] = getattr(_functools, x).    del x...so, as i understand it, blank tries to import _functools, fails and tries to launch some loop with getattr and that's where it fails to find some module attribute."
