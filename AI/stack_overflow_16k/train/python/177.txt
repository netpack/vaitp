"store large data at the end of blank source how to read data from the end of the source file?..the only way that i have thought of to do this would be to reopen the source from within the program and reading the source as text. there has to be code to deal with .pyc files...is there an easier, more blankic way to do this? i suppose it might involve some way to make a forward reference in a blank source file, like this (which doesn't work)...test_data = gettestdata().for d in data:.    # do all kinds of stuff in may lines of code..def gettestdata():.    return .        (many lines of data)"
