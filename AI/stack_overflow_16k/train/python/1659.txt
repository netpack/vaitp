"file manipulation: lists, removing `n`s code:..with open (""test1_votes.txt"", 'r'):.    f = open(""test1_votes.txt"").    lines = f.readlines().    print(lines[0]).    print(lines[1]).    all_lines = []..    lines = lines.rstrip(""n"") #does not work.    for line in lines:.        #in here.        all_lines.append(line).    print(all_lines)...right now it prints outputs something like:.    ['1,2,3,0,0n', ...].    i would like it to output [[1, 2, 3, 0, 0], ...]..file sample:..1,2,3,0,0..1,3,2,0,0..2,3,1,0,0..3,0,1,2,0..3,0,1,0,2..the zero's must be kept in there and there is not a blank line in between each line in the .txt..any suggestions/answers?..thanks in advance"
