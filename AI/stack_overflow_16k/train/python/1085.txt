"blank script to copy files i am trying to write a blank script that will copy files from one user’s home directory into another user’s home directory. i want it to copy the permissions, as well. i read the blank api and i think that the copy2 method does just that. however, when i run the following code, i get errors...import shutil..src = raw_input(""please enter a source: "").dst = raw_input(""please enter a destination: "").shutil.copy2(src, dst)...the error says:..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""copyfiles.py"", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;.    shutil.copy2(src, dst).  file ""/usr/lib/blank2.6/shutil.py"", line 99, in copy2.    copyfile(src, dst).  file ""/usr/lib/blank2.6/shutil.py"", line 52, in copyfile.    fsrc = open(src, 'rb').ioerror: [errno 2] no such file or directory: '../../../../desktop/byteswap.c'"
