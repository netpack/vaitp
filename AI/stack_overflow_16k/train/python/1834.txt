"print text from a terminal command into shell i am creating a ms-dos replica to test out my blank skills since i am particularly new and i'm writing the ""dir"" command. right now, the command opens a terminal that seems to be doing what i want it to be doing, except for printing it out into a terminal instead of the program output. i want to transfer the text it creates in the command line to the output of the program, basically. here's what i'm using right now:..if command == (""dir""):.    os.system('dir')...anyway, thanks for the help if anyone sees this, since i am pretty nooby at blank and new to this website."
