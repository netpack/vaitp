"index array of a list of strings i have a ""list"" of strings and i need to get a index array of all the elements of the list that equal a pattern...i don't need to use a blank list, i can use another data structure, but i don't know which...example:..my_list = ['foo', 'bar', 'hello', 'foo', 'goodbye'].pattern = 'foo'...and my desired result is something like:..my_mask = [true, false, false, true, false]...so i can then index a numpy array with this mask:..selected_items = my_array[my_mask]...however, having a list and doing:..my_list == pattern...doesn't return a mask, just false."
