"""cannot use absolute pathname"" error im trying to install a blank library for some software i just downloaded, and i'm getting this error when i run the library install from the command line. the error occures when it hits this point ..info 2015-02-14 13:47:20, 467 main thread _7zipcontroller.unzip.13 running:c:usersdesktopbbostools7-zip7za.exe x -y -oc:userdesktopbbosnew folderrlibsite-package c:userdesktopbbosnew folderlibsite-packagespymysql.7z..i'm not real familiar with blank, so forgive me if this isn't enough information. if you need more info, i can try and provide as much as possible!..edit:..the software im trying to install is called ""baseball on a stick"" its a software package that extracts files from mlb.com and then places them into a mysql database. this error occurs when i try and install the ""installblanklibs.py"" file that comes with the software. if you need to know more about the software, you can google ""baseball on a stick"" and it should be one of the first links to sourceforge. there is a video on there as well that shows exactly what i'm trying to do, but for some reason it doesn't work when i try and do it. hopefully this is enough extra information. here is the link to the software and video https://sourceforge.net/projects/baseballonastic/..thanks in advance"
