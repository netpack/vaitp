"while loop giving different return and print results? the below code is for a class exercise. we are trying to find the last position of the target string:..def find_last(search, target):.    count = 0.    while search.find(target, count) != -1:.        return search.find(target, count).        count = count +1..print find_last('aaaabbaaabbbab', 'ab')...the answer should be 12 but if i run the code i get the answer 3...however, if i use this code:..def find_last(search, target):.    count = 0.    while search.find(target, count) != -1:.        print search.find(target, count).        count = count +1..print find_last('aaaabbaaabbbab', 'ab')...i get this answer instead: ..3 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 12 12 12 12 none...so, it looks like my function is finding the correct answer 12, the question is why is it printing out 3, which is the first result of the loop, and not 12 when i use the return statement?"
