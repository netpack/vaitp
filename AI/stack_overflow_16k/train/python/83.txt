"importing a module embedded in an executable's blank api? i have an application that provides a nice blank api (blank3, fwiw). using its gui i can trigger blank scripts or use its blank shell. in the scripts i have it run, i can import the foo module the vendor provides. what i'd like to do is import foo from a stand-alone blank session. is this possible? (or does it depend on how it's implemented?)..i looked at sys.path in the interactive shell they provide but don't see anything relevant...when the application spawns a blank interpreter, is it somehow injecting a module into it that can't be accessed from a stand-alone blank interpreter or is there a way to tell my blank interpreter to find foo inside the application's executable?..for what it's worth:..&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.&lt;module 'foo' (built-in)&gt;.&gt;&gt;&gt;"
