"query on blank control flow statements and lambda exp in blank, we say everything is an object,..for instance: expression x&lt;y internally calls x.__lt__(y)..where __lt__ is the method in object  of class('int' say if values are 2 &amp; 3) and x and y are reference variables to objects..and..user defined function square(3) internally calls square.__call__(3).where 'square' is the name of an object of class 'function' and reference variable 'square' points to that object name 'square'...so,..how are if-elif-else, for, break, continue, pass, lambda statements interpreted internally? as objects?..if yes, can you give some examples to visualise in similar above manner?"
