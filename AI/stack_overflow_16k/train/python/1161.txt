"blank: can't store value in variable, stays none i'm trying to write this program which asks for numbers and stores the smallest and largest in two variables which are both none at the beginning...somehow the largest number is stored as i want it but the smallest number never makes it...here's my code:..largest = none.smallest = none..while true:.    inp = raw_input(""enter a number: "").    if inp == ""done"" : break..    try :.         num = int(inp).    except :.        print ""invalid input"".        continue.    if num == none or num &lt; smallest :.        num = smallest.    if num == none or num &gt; largest :.        num = largest..print ""maximum is"", largest.print ""minimum is"", smallest...as soon as i typed in some numbers and end the program with ""done"" the output looks like this:..maximum is 56.minimum is none...i checked the indentation a couple of times."
