"parse an array into smaller list of text elements i am very new to blank but if you have a list of text lines say..[""rr tt hh"", ""qq pp ll""]...how can you further split each element of the list into an array based on the space character between the elements. the desired outcome is.a new array with the following..list 1 position [""rr"", ""tt"", ""hh""].     2 position [""qq"", ""pp"", ""ll""]...and so on"
