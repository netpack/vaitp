"how to reverse the bits of each character in a string using blank i would like to find a way to reverse the bits of each character in a string using blank...for example, if my first character was j, this is ascii 0x4a or 0b01001010, so would be reversed to 0x52 or 0b01010010. if my second character was k, this is 0b01001011, so would be reversed to 0xd2 or 0b11010010, etc...the end result should be returned as a string...speed is my number one priority here, so i am looking for a fast way to accomplish this."
