"is there a way to check a variable that exists in a different script than the original one? i'm trying to check if a variable, which was previously set to true in 2.py in 1.py, as 1.py is only supposed to continue if the variable is true...2.py..import os..completed = false..#some stuff here..completed = true...1.py..import 2 ..if completed == true.   #do things...however i get a syntax error at ..if completed == true"
