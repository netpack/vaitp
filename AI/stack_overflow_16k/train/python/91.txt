"prime factorization algorithm i'm trying to write function to find the prime factorization of a given number.  it need not be fast, or efficient, it just needs to work...here is my idea:...pick a number and a starting point (which will be 2)..if the number is divisible by 2, add one to a counter and divide the number by 2.  .when the number is not divisible by 2, change your starting point to 3..repeat....here is my code:..def ffs(num):..factors={}..n=2..while n&lt;num:..    while num%n==0:..        num=num/n..        if n in factors:.            factors[n]+=1.        else:.            factors[n]=1...    n+=1..return factors...i run into some problems early on.  when i try to evaluate ffs(6) i should get {2: 1, 3:1}, but instead i get {2: 1}.  can someone try to spot my error?"
