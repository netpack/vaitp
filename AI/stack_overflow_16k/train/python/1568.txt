"trying to make some matrix operations to learn, but i have a mistake i want this program in blank..m = [[1,0,0],.     [0,1,0],.     [0,0,1]]..n = [[1,2,3],.     [2,3,4],.     [2,4,1]]..def cofactor(s,j):.    p = m.copy().    for i in range(0,len(p)):.        p[i].pop(s).    p.pop(j).    return p.cofact = cofactor(2,1).print(cofact).print(m)...to give me back this ..[[1, 0], [0, 0]].[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]...but instead is giving ..  [[1, 0], [0, 0]].[[1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0]]...and i do not know what am i doing wrong. i need to understand and find my mistake. thanks."
