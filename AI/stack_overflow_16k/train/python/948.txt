"what is the use of * in blank function definition? def iglob(pathname, *, recursive=false):.""""""return an iterator which yields the paths matching a pathname pattern...the pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la.fnmatch. however, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a.dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'.patterns...if recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and.zero or more directories and subdirectories.."""""".it = _iglob(pathname, recursive).if recursive and _isrecursive(pathname):.    s = next(it)  # skip empty string.    assert not s.return it...when i browse the glob's code in blank3.5.1, the function defined here, why there is a * in the function parameter list. and if i pass three parameters to this function the typeerror raised, what's the effect of the *? thanks first."
