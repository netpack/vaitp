"how to prevent any input except for numbers i'm quite new to coding. i've managed to produce this code which is a little test for children. it works fine i just need to prevent kids from entering letters or other characters when math questions are asked. something like ""please only enter numbers"" should come up. i've tried a variety of functions like valueerror but with no luck. any help will be appreciated!..import time.import random.import math.import operator as op..def test():.    number1 = random.randint(1, 10).    number2 = random.randint(1, num1)..    ops = {.        '+': op.add,  .        '-': op.sub,.        '*': op.mul,.        }..    keys = list(ops.keys()) .    rand_key = random.choice(keys)  .    operation = ops[rand_key]  ..    correctresult = operation(number1, number2)..    print (""what is {} {} {}?"".format(number1, rand_key, number2)).    useranswer= int(input(""your answer: ""))..    if useranswer != correctresult:.        print (""incorrect. the right answer is {}"".format(correctresult)).        return false.    else:.        print(""correct!"").        return true..username=input(""what is your name?"")..print (""hi {}! wellcome to the arithmetic quiz..."".format(username))..while true:.    try:.        # try to convert the user's input to an integer.        usersclass = int(input(""which class are you in? (1,2 or 3)"")).    except valueerror:.        # oh no!, the user didn't give us something that could be converted.        # to an int!.        print(""please enter a number!"").    else:.        # ok, we have an integer... is it 1, 2, or 3?.        if usersclass not in {1,2,3}:.            print(""please enter a number in {1,2,3}!"").        else:.            # the input was 1,2, or 3! break out of the infinite while....            break..input(""press enter to start..."").start = time.time()..correctanswers = 0.numquestions = 10..for i in range(numquestions):.    if test():.        correctanswers +=1..print(""{}: you got {}/{} {} correct."".format(username, correctanswers,  numquestions,.'question' if (correctanswers==1) else 'questions'))..end = time.time().etime = end - start.timetaken = round(etime)..print (""you completed the quiz in {} seconds."".format(timetaken))..if usersclass == 1:.    with open(""class1.txt"",""a+"") as f:.        f.write(""   {}:scored {} in {} seconds."".format(username,correctanswers,timetaken))..elif usersclass == 2:.    with open(""class2.txt"",""a+"") as f:.        f.write(""   {}:scored {} in {} seconds."".format(username,correctanswers,timetaken))..elif usersclass == 3:.    with open(""class3.txt"",""a+"") as f:.        f.write(""   {}:scored {} in {} seconds."".format(username,correctanswers,timetaken)).else:.    print(""sorry, we can not save your data as the class you entered is not valid."")"
