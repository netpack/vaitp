"how can i produce a hex-escaped string in blank that i can use in c++? i'm trying to create synthesized unit tests for a library that uses messagepack. i would like to create hex-escaped binary strings in blank that i can embed in c++ sources. i'm creating one like this:...in [6]: umsgpack.packb([0, 0, 'dummy_void_zeroarg', []]).out[6]: 'x94x00x00xc4x12dummy_void_zeroargx90'...however, it looks like the resulting hex string is almost, but not quite usable in c++:...error: hex escape sequence out of range.        ""x94x00x00xc4x12dummy_void_zeroargx90"";.                         ^~~~~...the reason is that the compiler tries to parse x12d as a single value. is there a way to transform the above hex string to one in blank that does not contain letters (i.e. only x items)?"
