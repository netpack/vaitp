"what's wrong with the following two lines i am trying to write a piece of blank code which will write a piece of cmake code .....but when i get to the following phase:..def_desc = ""blaa"".s = ""    file(write ${config_h} ""/* {0} */\n"")n"".format(def_desc)...then blank yells at me:..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""/home/ferencd/tmp/blaa.py"", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;.    s = ""    file(write ${config_h} ""/* {0} */\n"")n"".format(def_desc).keyerror: 'config_h'.[finished in 0.0s with exit code 1]...i understood that somehow the interpreter thinks that {config_h} is supposed to mean a parameter from the parameter list of format ... but no, i'd really like to print out that into the output ... as it is...how can i deal with this situation?"
