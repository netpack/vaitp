"initialize an empty multidimensional list i would like to initialize a multidimensional list capable of storing an object for every minute since year 1950-2050...something like:..minute = [none]*61.hour = [minute]*25.day = [hour].month = [day].data = [month]*100...so you can do:..data[89][1][29][23][55] = 'it was a good minute the one from january 29th in 1989 when it was 23:55'...how would be such a multidimensional list be initialized in blank? would it be an actual different object than the one created with the above code?..initially the multidimensional list would contain objects none...blank 2.7..following answer i tried:..# data structure.minute = 60.hour = 24.day = 31.month = 12.year = 100.test = [[[[[none for _minute in range(minute)] for _hour in range(hour)] for _day in range(day)] for _month in range(month)] for _year in range(year)]...but it seems too much for multidimensional lists, as i get ""killed"" when trying to execute this."
