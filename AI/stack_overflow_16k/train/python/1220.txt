"popen.returncode not working in blank? i have a price of code which transfers file from server to local machine. however, the directory the user enters may not be always correct. if the user enters the incorrect directory i am trying to show the error. if the returncode is not none i will show the error. but this doesn't work. no matter what the program throws it always go to else part. ..#!/usr/bin/blank..import subprocess....result = subprocess.popen(['sshpass', '-p', 'password', 'rsync', '-avz', '--info=progress2', 'username@host_name:/file_name', '/home/zurelsoft/test'], .                                    stdout=subprocess.pipe)..if result.returncode != none:.    print ""directory incorrect""..else:.    print ""done"".    print result"
