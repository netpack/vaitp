"does blank have one way of doing things? i have always seen in blank articles/books that blank is simple and it has only one way of doing things. i would like someone to explain to me this concept keeping in mind the example below, if i wanted to get the min and max values of sequence i would do the following;..seq=[1,2,3,4,5,6]..min(seq) #1..max(seq) #6...but i can also do this;..seq[:1]  #1..seq[-1]  #6...surely this are two ways of doing one simple thing. this confuses me a bit."
