"functions to receive input from user and return sum and square in blank i am a first time programmer learning blank and need to receive input from the user and return the input along with the sum and square of the entered data.  i have prompted for the input and can print that but not sure how to pass the input to the sum function and square function. ..here is what i have:..def sum(list):.  data = input(""enter a list of numbers or enter to quit: "").  for data in list():.    return sum(list) # not sure how to make it x*y for my list of values?.  print(""the sum of your list is: "", list)...and this is the same for my square function.  not sure how to make:..return(list**2) #return each number in list by **2?"
