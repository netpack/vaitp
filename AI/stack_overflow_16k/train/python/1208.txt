create rainbow table from words in text file with blank i'm looking to write a script to parse through a text file and create md4 hashes of every word in the text file. i want the output to be sent to a different text file. this is what i have so far:..import hashlib.passwd = open(list.txt).lines = passwd.readlines().passwd.close()..hash_object = hashlib.md4(passwd.encode().print(hash_object.hexdigest())
