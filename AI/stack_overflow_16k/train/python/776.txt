"blank, entry point of opensfm? i'm not a blank expert but i've to learn how to use it..i have a tool to look through, which i've installed and works perfectly but i have a very silly/stupid/noob question:..this script runs this as very first command, but i cannot see any main etc. and therefore i'm not sure how exactly this works, there's no main function etc, it seems to me that the class command actually embeds the whole entry point...is this correct?..for example i've tried to reproduce the structure in the following way:..file script..#!/usr/bin/env bash..set -e..dir=$( cd ""$( dirname ""${bash_source[0]}"" )"" &amp;&amp; pwd )..$dir/ helloworld $1...file .py..import os;..class command:.   name = ""helloworld"".   help = ""test""..   def run(self,args):.       print ""hello world!""...i'm sure i've also problems with imports etc....i'm just trying to write down some very simple examples for future references."
