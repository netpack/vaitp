"cross-platform method for finding blank include folder i have blank extension code that i need to cross-platform compile, and to do so, i need to be able to find the blank include folder.  on linux and mac osx, i can do blank-config --include and it gives me something like -i/library/frameworks/blank.framework/versions/6.3/include/blank2.6.  this is fine and dandy, except that my windows blank distro doesn't have blank-config.  is there an easy way, through blank code, of finding where it thinks the include folder is?  for numpy, this snippet does the job: ..try:.    numpy_include = numpy.get_include().except attributeerror:.    numpy_include = numpy.get_numpy_include()...is there an analogous method for the blank include folder?"
