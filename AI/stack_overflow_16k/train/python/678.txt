"merge lists of different size with order is there a good way to merge lists like that:..l1 = [1.1, 1.2, 1.3]..l2 = [2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4]..l3 = [3.1, 3.2]...result: ..[1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 1.3, 2.3, 2.4]...there should be no ""none"" elements in result...edit..since it was marked as duplicate:.i do not need a result like this:..[(1.1, 2.1, 3.1), (1.2, 2.2, 3.2), (1.3, 2.3, none), (none, 2.4, none)]...i do not need any ""none"" elements. and the result should be one list."
