"start inner loop from position of the outer in my example i have two loops. one nested within the other. is there a way i can start the inner loop from the index of the outer. here is pseudo code. ..arrayofwords = [""one"",""two"",""five""].arrayofwords2 = [""one"",""two"",""three"",""four"",""five""].tottalwordlist = [].for index, jstring in enumerate(arrayofwords):.    gword = arrayofwords[index].    indexclone = index.    arrayofwords2count = range(len(arrayofwords2)-1).    for indexclone in arrayofwords2count:.        if gword == arrayofwords2[indexclone]:.            tottalwordlist.append(gword).            break"
