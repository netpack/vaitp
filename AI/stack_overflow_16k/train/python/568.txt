"access specific element of multi dimensional array i have a multi dimensional array called zsurface which looks like:..zsurface = np.array([[-4.38,-3.95,-3.6,-3.24,-1.14,-0.8,-0.5,-0.15],.       [-4.15,-3.8,-3.5,-3.18,-1.19,-0.87,-0.58,-0.24],.       [-4.04,-3.73,-3.45,-3.15,-1.22,-0.9,-0.62,-0.28],.       [-3.99,-3.69,-3.43,-3.13,-1.23,-0.92,-0.64,-0.31],.       [-3.98,-3.68,-3.42,-3.13,-1.24,-0.93,-0.65,-0.32],.       [-3.96,-3.66,-3.41,-3.12,-1.25,-0.94,-0.66,-0.33]])...could someone please let me know if i wanted to access a specific element of the array how to retrieve it.  for exampe say i wanted to assign the element at row 3 column 4 (-3.15) to a variable...would var = zsurface[3][4] work?"
