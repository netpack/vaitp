"blank iterate through list and count items of a certain value hi i have a blank problem whereby i have to count which list elements contain the value 2, in a list with various levels of nest. e.g.:..my_list = [[2,3,2,2], [[2,1,2,1], [2,1,1]], [1,1,1]]...this list can have have up to three levels of nesting but could also be two or only one level deep...i have piece of code which sort of works:..count = 0.for i in my_list:.    if len(i) &gt; 1:.        for x in i:.            if 2 in x:.                count += 1.    elif i == 2:.        count += 1...however, apart from being very ugly, this does not take account of the potential to have a list with a single element which is 2. it also doesn't work to get len() on a single int...i know list comprehension should be able to take care of this but i am a litle stuck on how to deal with the potential nesting...any help would be much appreciated."
