"how to create multiple lists from data frame column value df1..    ticker          category.0      xom           group 1.1      cvx           group 1.2  rdsa-gb           group 2.3    bp-gb  group 1, group 2.4  eqnr-no           group 3.5    fp-fr           group 4.6   eni-it  group 3, group 4.7      cop           group 5...the result i'm going for would create lists of 'ticker' based on the 'category' column and name that list the 'category' value while replacing spaces with ""_"" ..secondly, if there's an instance where category has two values, such as ""us major, euro major"" then how could i make sure that ""ticker"" ends up in both category lists?..group_1 = ['xom','cvx','bp-gb'].group_2 = ['rdsa-gb','bp-gb'].group_3 = ['eqnr-no','eni-it'].group_4 = ['fp-fr','eni-it'].group_5 = ['cop']...thanks!"
