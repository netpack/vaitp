"a key error in blank i am trying to write a ""multi-user"" program that stores a shop list of items for every user logging in during the time the program runs.to do so i made a function called login_to_user that basically checks if a user has already logged in, and if not, creates a new place in the nested dict var user_database to store his shop list...def login_to_user(user_database):. username = raw_input(""enter your username: ""). for username in user_database.keys():.     if(username in user_database):.         shop_list = user_database[username][""shop_list""] . else:.     user_database[username][""shop_list""] = 0 #gives place to new user in dictionary.     shop_list = user_database[username][""shop_list""] .     shop_list = get_list_from_user().     shop_list = organize_list(shop_list)...but after i try to run a program and enter a test user, i will always get the following error:..    traceback (most recent call last):.    file ""shopping-michaelex4.py"", line 170, in &lt;module&gt;.    main().    file ""shopping-michaelex4.py"", line 164, in main.    login_to_user(user_database).    file ""shopping-michaelex4.py"", line 156, in login_to_user.    user_database[username][""shop_list""] = 0 #gives place to new user in .    dictionary.    keyerror: 'test'...i read about the key error and never found a solution to my problem. i tried to initialize the nested dict a couple of times in a different way. so far, nothing worked...i would really appreciate any solutions to my problem. thanks!"
