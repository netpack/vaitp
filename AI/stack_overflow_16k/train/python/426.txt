"why is my blank datetime object (created from a timestamp) not automatically being created as utc? i'm grabbing a utc timestamp from javascript and passing it to my blank code.  i want to store that date as a datetime, so i construct it with dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(int(starttime) / 1000).  i check the timestamp and it is for 12:00 am utc on a specific date.  however, when i print out this newly created datetime object, it prints as 19:00 from the day before.  ..there is clearly some timezone issues at work here, but i expect that the default should always be utc (apparently i expect wrong).  how do i get this to always operate under utc, rather than have some weird timezone transformation at play?"
