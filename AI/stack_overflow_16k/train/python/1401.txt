"issues dealing with fractions using bisection search in blank i need to use bisection search to approximate the square root of a number. i wrote the following code but it only works when my number is greater than 1. if it's a decimal like 0.36 in the following example, my code is just not working. could you please look at it and give me suggestions on why and how to fix it?..x = 0.36.dp = 0.01.numguesses = 0.low = 0.0.high = x.ans = (high + low)/2.0.while abs(ans**2 - x) &gt;= dp:.    print(""low =""+ str(low) + ""high = "" + str(high) + "" ans = ""  + str(ans)).    numguesses += 1.    if ans**2 &lt; x:.        low = ans.    else:.        high = ans.    ans = (high + low)/2.0.print(""numguesses ="" + str(numguesses)).print(str(ans) + ""is close to square root of""  + str(x))"
