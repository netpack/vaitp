"find() first find the index of the first letter match value and then check it the entire substring is contained in string? i donâ€™t really understand find() method. at first, i thought it was kind of like the remove() method in the sense that.remove() removes the first matching item in the list, while find() returns the index of the first letter of the substring..but, if the entire substring does not contain in the string, it will return -1..so is my understanding correct? find() first find the index of the first letter of the substring, and then sees if.the entire substring is contained in the string. if it does, then the index of the first letter of substring is returned..otherwise, -1 will be returned. if the first letter of the substring does not exist in string, -1 is returned? or does it recursively look at each letter, if any letter does not contain in string, return -1"
