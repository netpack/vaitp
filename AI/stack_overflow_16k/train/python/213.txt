"extract the data along with searched string in blank my file (a table) actually looks like this.  i want to search for a string like ""vonmises"" in the file.  then that is the starting point of what i want to extract.  i have 9 tables like the ones shown below.  now i can search for a ""vonmises"" string in my file, but my question is how to extract the tabular data along with string. ..the code i wrote for searching 'vonmises' string is:..import re.f_read = open('filename','r').str='von mises'.for line in f_read:    .    m=re.search(str,line).    if m:.        print line...my actual table:..                          stresses in quadrilateral element..    elemnt-id grid-id fib-dis stresses in elemnt coord sys principal stresses.                                norm-x  norm-y  shear-xy     angle major minor vonmises   .        1         2     45         234    4565    675         65     345   345   54345.                 43     32         444    3243    324         65     453   543   34223 ..                           stresses in quadrilateral element.   elemnt-id grid-id fib-dis stresses in elemnt coord sys principal stresses.                                 norm-x norm-y shear-xy     angle major minor vonmises   .        2        34    324        342    556     565         546    53   6543   3456.                 45    345        657    676     856         674    65   676    6766...when i execute the above i code the result i get is:..  elemnt-id grid-id fib-dis stresses in elemnt coord sys principal stresses..  elemnt-id grid-id fib-dis stresses in elemnt coord sys principal stresses...so what i want is, along with the above result, to also get tabular values and i want to extract only the vonmises stress column and dump that into a text file...     elemnt-id grid-id fib-dis stresses in elemnt coord sys principal stresses.                                norm-x  norm-y  shear-xy     angle major minor vonmises   .        1         2     45         234    4565    675         65     345   345   54345.                 43     32         444    3243    324         65     453   543   34223"
