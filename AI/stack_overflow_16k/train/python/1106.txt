"trying to spread out difference between cells in list i have a list that moves around 100 by a small bit (see the list in the code below). for the days that i have 0, i would like to spread out the difference of the previous cells. ..(i'm counting zero as the first cell in the text below, because blank)..to give an example, the original_list below has the value 100.41191500000001 in cell 2, and 0 in cells 3,4,5. i would like to take the change abs(original_list[1]-original_list[2])=1,26108000000001, and spread it out over the three days. so basically i would like cell 2 to be occupied by original_list[1]+(1.26108000000001/4), cell 3 to be new_list[2] + (1.26108000000001/4), cell 4 to be new_list[3] + (1.26108000000001/4), and finally cell 5 to also be new_list[4] + (1.26108000000001/4)...i divide by four because i want the change that happened between cell 1 and 2, to be spread out evenly between cells 1 to 5...the code below presents what i've tried, but i'm not sure if this is the best approach. any help would be greatly appreciated...original_list = [98.87464, 99.150835, 100.41191500000001, 0, 0, 0, 101.650165, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 101.850421, 0, 99.970131, 100.244205, 98.550495, 0, 0, 97.496535, 97.971645].new_list = [0 for i in range(len(original_list))]..for i in range(len(original_list)):.    j = i.    if original_list[i] == 0:.        while original_list[j] == 0:.            j += 1.    elif original_list[i] != 0:.        new_list[i] = original_list[i].    if j != i:..        for k in range(0,j-i+1):.            new_list[i+k] = new_list[i-1] + abs(new_list[i]-new_list[i-1])/(j-i+1)..print(new_list)"
