"more error info + longer program or less error info + shorter program? def question():.    original = input(""enter a word: "").    if "" "" in original:.        print(""n**please only enter one word.**"").        question()..    elif len(original) &lt;= 0:.        print(""n**it seems as though you did not enter a word.**"").        question()..    elif not original.isalpha():.        print(""n**please only use letters.**"").        question()..    else:.        print(original)..question()...vs...def question():.    original = input(""enter a word: "").    if len(original) &gt; 0 and original.isalpha() and "" "" not in original:.        print(original).    else:.        print(""**make sure you enter a word, only use letters, and only enter single word.**"").        question()..question()...these two programs basically the same thing. but the top program is longer and gives more information on what went wrong when a user enters an invalid response. the bottom program is much shorter but does not give as much info for invalid responses. in real world coding, as in professional programming, which one of the programs would be preferred over the other?"
