"project euler using blank, regarding definition of multiples i started programming recently, my first language being blank. i know just the basics of the language including conditionals, loops, range and some other functions...i tried to solve project euler's problem 1 using blank. the problem statement is as follows:..if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. the sum of these multiples is 23..find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000...here's my solution:..z=0.for x in range(0,1000,1):.    if type(x%3)==int or type(x%5)==int:.        z=x+z.print z...the answer i get is 499500 which is wrong. i tried searching for an answer and found that replacing the third line of my solution:..if type(x%3)==int or type(x%5)==int...with..if x%3==0 or x%5==0...yields the correct answer which is 233168...why is my code wrong? so far as i'm aware, a multiple need not leave the remainder as zero. for instance, 255 is a multiple of 5. but 255%5 does not leave the remainder as zero. so how does the line if x%3==0 or x%5==0 correct the answer when in fact, it ignores the definition of multiples...or perhaps i have wrongly assumed what multiples are. please help me...thank you."
