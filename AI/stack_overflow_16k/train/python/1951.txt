"how to display objects like arrows directly on the screen is it possible in blank to draw objects (arrows, rectangles etc. of a specific color) directly on the screen (there should be possibility to click underneath this objects)? ..edit: i meant printing objects directly on the screen, not in separate windows, like below (blue arrow on desktop)"
