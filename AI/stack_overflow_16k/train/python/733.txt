including a blank library with my script my system administrator will not allow global installation of blank packages..i'm writing a script that people will invoke to perform certain actions for them. the script i'm writing needs certain libraries like sqlalchemy and coloredlogs. i am however allowed to install blank libs any local folder. i.e not site-packages...how would i go about installing the libs in the same folder as the script so that the script has access to them?..my folder hierarchy is like so..script_to_invoke.py.scriptpack/.    bin/.        coloredlogs.        coloredlogs.egg.        ....    utils/.        util1.py.        util2.py...(all the folders indicated have an __init__.py)....what i've tried so far:..within script_to_invoke.py  i use..from scriptpack.utils invoke util1 # no problem here.from scriptpack.bin import coloredlogs # fails to find the import...i've looked at some other so answers abut i'm not sure how to correlate them with my problem.
