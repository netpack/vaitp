"my if and else statements wont bypass each other our job in class is to write a text based game that is interactive. i am basing mine off of the stanley parable, which is a real video game. the problem is that when an if and else statement is bypass, i get an error. the whole point is not to have every question asked each time. it should only ask them in the order that the player chooses. this is my code. i was wondering if there is a way to get navigate through all the questions..p.s. i didn't finish some of the if and else statements so i just told them to print goose...this is my code:..print (""stanley lives in a world where he is always told what to do. he goes        to work, he pushes the buttons that he is told to push over his intercom, and then    he goes home and eats the food that he is given by the overseer. one day, stanley goes to work and discovers that nobody is there. he waits for commands to come over on his intercom but they fail to do so."").begin = input (""does stanley leave his office?"").if begin == ""yes"":.    q2 = input (""stanley left his office and decided to go to the break room to see where everybody went, it was the first decision he ever made and it made him feel proud. stanley got to the break room but nobody was there. he had noticed that in the break room, there were two doors that he had never seen before. which door did he choose, right or left?"")..else: .    print (""so stanley stayed in his office where he never recieved another command, never recieved anymore food and died of starvation and depression."")..if q2 == ""left"":.    q3 = input(""stanley decided to walk throught the left door where he found a red door and a blue door, but which color did he choose?"")..else:.    q4 = input (""stanley decided to go through the right door which brought him into a room with a green door and an orange door. which did he choose?"")..if q3 == ""blue"":.    q5 = input (""so after a little bit of puzzling over, stanley decided to go through the blue door where found an elevator and a gun. does he pick up the gun."")..else:.    print (""so stanley walked throught the red door where a gunsman opened the door and shot him, he fell to the ground and died."")..if q5 == ""yes"":.    q9 = input (""stanley wondered what this gun was doing here and he knew that things were getting pretty strange. he though to himself that in the case that his work mates had become zombies and were hiding amongst this maze of doors, he could protect himself. now that he has a gun, does he decide to use the elevator?"")....if q4 == ""orange"":.    print (""stanley decided to go through the orange door. as he was walking through the hallway beyond the orange door, the floor beneath him collapsed which led to his demise."")..else:.    q6 = input (""stanley decided to go through the green door where he was confronted with a narrow hallway. he continued to walk through the hallway until he came to a split in which there were two branches of this hallway for him to choose. did he choose the left or the right?"")..if q9 == ""yes"":.    q7 = input (""stanley decided to use the elevator. he got into the elevator and there were two buttons. up or down?"")..else:.    print(""goose"")..if q7 == ""down"":.    q8 = input (""stanley decided to do down the elevator. he waited until he had reached the bottom and the doors had opened up. the elevator doors had opened to a huge room full of chairs. it was almost as if a meeting were to be held there but nobody showed up. all of the sudden stanley hears some noise. he sees one of his workmates run out from underneath one of the chairs and start running toward him. his workmates name if philip. philip is covered in blood and has a missing arm. does stanley shoot philip?
