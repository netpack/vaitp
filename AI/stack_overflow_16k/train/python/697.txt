can't find matplotlib.pyplot to import? i'm trying to run the following code on my mac running blank 3.6..import matplotlib.pyplot as plt...but i'm getting the following error..modulenotfounderror: no module named 'matplotlib'...i know i have already installed pip so this shouldn't happen...i think this has something to do with what kind of blank i am running? when i run blank on my terminal it says i'm running blank 3.6 but /usr/bin/blank says i'm running 2.7...thanks in advance
