"elegant way of re-raise exception with finally part exists i want to catch exception out of a function, while if finally part exists in the function, the outer part couldn't know exception exists...here is the code:..def f():.    l = []..    try:.        raise exception('fake').    except:.        raise e.    finally:.        return l..try:.    f().except:.    print 'wrong'.else:.    print 'right'...output is..right...and if i remove ""finally"" part, it will output wrong as expected...i know the reason from here, but i don't know any elegant way to deal with this scenario, how should i write code if i need re-raise and finally together?"
