"is there a way to have a mathematical function as the argument of a function in blank 3? how can i include a mathematical function as an argument of a function in blank?..in my particular case, i'm writing a riemann sum calculator that would ideally look like:..def riemann_sum(func_x, minvalue, maxvalue, partitions).....return riemannsum...where func_x is some function of x so that i could find the riemann sum of any arbitrary function this:..func_x = x**2.minvalue = 1.maxvalue = 2.partitions = 100.a = riemann_sum(func_x,minvalue,maxvalue,partitions).print(a)...however, i can't do the above procedure because x is undefined...i can get the riemann sum for particular functions of x by manually typing it in to a line of my function that looks like:..somelist = [x**2 for x in someotherlist]...here, the function is x**2, but i can't change it without physically going in and changing the function. ..my only solution right now is to define a new riemann sum function every time i want to find the definite integral of a new function, which works but i feel like there's a better way...(edit: my question is different from the riemann sum question marked as a possible duplicate. their question is about an implementation specifically for a riemann sum. my question is about how to incorporate a math function as the argument of a function, and i happen to use riemann sum as a particular example)"
