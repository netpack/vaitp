"store long string externally but needs be translated to exe with the scripts i have a function in my program that will send an email to a user. i have a template for the email that will use the blank placeholders which will be replaced with the users information such as their name. the program needs to be converted/translated to .exe when being deployed and the templates are very large strings and i assumed it is not best practice to just set them to a string within the script...i have tried creating a separate script that contains all of the templates and them importing this into the main script which works but i'm not sure if there is a more elegant way of doing this such as created a permanent external file that will be converted into the .exe . i have also tried using a plain text file but i assumed this would not get translated into the .exe with the rest of the script...email = """"""&lt;h1&gt;welcome&lt;/h1&gt;.&lt;p&gt;this is an example email that contains your temporary password: %s&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;the end of my really short example email :p :) &lt;/p&gt;"""""""
