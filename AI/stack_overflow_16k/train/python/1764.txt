"easy blank: number guesser i think this is easiest if i just give you the problem verbatim:..""write a blank program that continuously asks the user for a number other than 10. if 10 is entered, reprimand the user that they are not to guess the number 10."" ..i'm getting an error -- basically, i don't know how to define the guess variable before i enter the while loop. ..target, guess = 10..while target != guess:.    guess = int(input('enter a number other than 10: '))..print(""hey, you weren't supposed to enter 10!"")"
