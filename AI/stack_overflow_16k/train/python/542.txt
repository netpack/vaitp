"is there a way to enable the inconsistent whitespace check (-t) in blank by default is there a way to either:...always have -t enabled by default (warn about inconsistent tab usage).be able to enable it programmatically on startup (eg. in a sitecustomize.py module)...it would need to work for embedded blank too (so aliasing blank or similar solutions will be of no use). use of sitecustomize.py allows us to hook into embedded blank instances, so this seems like a good place for it...i thought the warnings module would provide a way to turn this warning on but i don't see anything...for reference:..usage: blank [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ....options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):.....-t     : issue warnings about inconsistent tab usage (-tt: issue errors).......any suggestions on how this might be done?..thanks."
