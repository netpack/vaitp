"function to keep removing duplicates in a string. indexerror: string index out of range i'm trying to write a function to keep removing duplicate characters in a string...expect:.input: ""abbaca"".output: ""ca""..input: ""abbacabb"".output: ""ca""..input: ""aaabbaca"".output: ""ca""..i keep getting this error but can't figure out why:.indexerror: string index out of range..i've tried commenting out the case in which the duplicates are not at the end of the string and it worked...this can excute but ignores all the duplicates at the beginning or in the middle:..def fun(s):.    if len(s) &lt; 2: return s.    keep = true.    while keep:.        for i in range(1, len(s)):.            keep = false.            #if s[i] == s[i - 1] and i &lt; len(s) - 1:.                #s = s[:i-1] + s[i+1:].                #keep = true.            if s[i] == s[i - 1] and i == len(s) - 1:.                s = s[:i-1].                keep = true.    return s...this covers all cases but generates the error:..def fun(s):.    if len(s) &lt; 2: return s.    keep = true.    while keep:.        for i in range(1, len(s)):.            keep = false.            if s[i] == s[i - 1] and i &lt; len(s) - 1:.                s = s[:i-1] + s[i+1:].                keep = true.            if s[i] == s[i - 1] and i == len(s) - 1:.                s = s[:i-1].                keep = true.    return s"
