"blank: for in not iterating over every value in a list i am having a very unusual issue with one of my methods. for some reason my for loop is skipping a value. here is my code:..def getpossvals(self, assignment):..    possvals = self.domain..    if assignment is not none:.        for item in assignment:.            for constraint in self.constraints:.                if item[0] is constraint.var[0]:..                    print(possvals) # print statement for testing..                    # this is the problematic for loop.                    for val in possvals:.                        print(val) # print statement for testing.                        if not self.checkval(item[1], val, constraint.op):.                            possvals.remove(val)..                elif item[0] is constraint.var[1]:.                    for val in possvals:.                        if not self.checkval(val, item[1], constraint.op):.                            possvals.remove(val)..    return possvals...i get the following terminal output while using a test case: ..[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]..1.2.3.5..i have never run into a problem like this and i can't find someone else with an issue quite like this. some people have had a similar problem but it's usually a problem with an if statement. my print statement is before any conditional statements and it still skips the value 4. any help would be greatly appreciated."
