how to make sure that the user can't move on without entering their name? i have the following piece of blank code:..def getplayername():  .   print().   playername = input('please enter your name: ').   print().   return playername...what should i do to make sure they can't move on until they enter their name because at the moment they can move on without entering their name by pressing enter?
