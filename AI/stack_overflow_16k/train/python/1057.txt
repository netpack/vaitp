"are there any reasons why it is particularly difficult to implement the multi-output regression function for the boosting based models? i""m looking for a boosting based models(adaboost, xgboost, lgb) that support multi-output regression just like that of a scikit learn's randomforestregressor. but i can't find any. ..i'm just curious. is there a special reason? for example, gradient-based boosting models require more memory, something like that?"
