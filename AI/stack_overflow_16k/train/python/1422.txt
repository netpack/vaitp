"pass an argument to a program in terminal that takes input after you start it i have a program that i am using which takes input in terminal after you start the program. it will not take the input by adding it after the process name. how can i pass it what i want? i know i could use virtual keypresses, but that seems inefficient and non-blankic, so it will be my last resort. ..below is an example of what i type and get when using the terminal, because i feel that i did not explain as well as i would have liked...user:~ $ program_name.enter your input here:"
