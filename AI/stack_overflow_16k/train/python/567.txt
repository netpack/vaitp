"making a game like mastermind in blank i'm trying to make a game like mastermind in blank but by using numbers [1-9] instead of colours. the game needs to be a little complex however and that is where i am struggling. i want to be able to randomly generate a password of 5 digits between [0-9] and make the user have 10 tries to get it right. if they guess a number correctly, i want to tell them where it is in their list and ask them to keep going as well. so far, i have this:..import random..random_password = [random.randint(0,9) for i in range (5)]..for counter in range (10):.    guess = input (""crack the mastermind code   "").    if guess != random_password :.        print (""guess again  "").#here i am trying to make it find out if it has a didgit correct, tell them where.#and ask the them to keep guessing. once count runs out, i want it to say they lost.    elif guess .    else print (""sorry, you lose :(  "").if guess == random_password :.    print (""congrats, you win!  "")...any help is appreciated overflow bros, i am lost. i know that i need it to access items from a list. would using a function like append work? ..edit: this is my new code. sorta works however my output is now showing it is wrong even when i guess the number correctly. it wants me to input with '' and , to separate the list but i shouldn't have to have the user do that to make the game function...import random..random_password = [str (random.randint(0,9)) for i in range (5)]..for counter in range (10):.    guess = input(str (""crack the mastermind code   "") ).    if guess != random_password :.        print (""guess again  "").#here i am tryin to make it find out if it has a didgit correct, tell them where.#and ask the them to keep guessing. once count runs out, i want it to say they lost.    for i in random_password:  .        if(i in guess):.            print (i).        if guess == random_password :.            print (""congrats, you win!  "").else :.    print (""sorry, you lose :(  the correct answer was.... "").    print (random_password)"
