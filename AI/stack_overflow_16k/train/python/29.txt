"string of numbers to a list of integers? i've been presented with the task of turning a string of mixed numbers (""1 3 5 8 10""), for example, and my goal is to put these numbers into a list as integers. ..i have the knowledge and know-how to split the string and int() them to turn them in to integers, but the issue comes in how i'm doing it..the specific issue i'm having is when it comes to looping through the string, finding the chars, and turning them into ints..as it's looping through and gets to 10 (or any 2 digit number), it turns each number into its own digit; so: 10 would be [1, 0], not [10]. ..please excuse the mess of code here, i've been trying to see what's going on each step with prints:..def iq_test(numbers):.    print(numbers).    nums = [].    numbers.split("" "").    nums.append(numbers).    print (numbers).    for char in numbers:.        if char == "" "":.            del char.        else:.            nums.append(int(char))  # problem arises here, where a 2 digit number is being added to the list as 2 separate numbers.    print(nums)...still very new to coding, so if you notice a major logic problem i'm running into, i'd appreciate it if you pointed it out to me."
