"how do i turn scraped list items into strings in blank? edit:..here is my actual code. i'm using beautifulsoup to do the scraping. once the scrape is done, i use bleach and the cleanhtml function to remove html code from each date entry...import mechanize.from bs4 import beautifulsoup as bs.import urllib2.import bleach.import re.import datetime as dt..def cleanhtml(raw_html):..  cleanr =re.compile('&lt;.*?&gt;')..  cleantext = re.sub(cleanr,'', raw_html)..  return cleantext..br = mechanize.browser().br.set_handle_robots(false).br.addheaders = [(""user-agent"", ""mozilla/5.0 (x11; u; linux i686; en-us;     rv:1.9.2.13) gecko/20101206 ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) firefox/3.6.13"")]..sign_in = br.open('https://www.mturk.com/mturk/beginsignin')..br.select_form(name=""signin"").br[""email""] = 'xxxx'.br[""password""] = 'xxxxx'.logged_in = br.submit()..mturk = br.open(""https://www.mturk.com/mturk/status"")..soup = bs(mturk.read())..date_column_values_raw = soup.findall(""td"", ""statusdatecolumnvalue"")..date_column_values = bleach.clean(date_column_values_raw, strip=true)..date_column_values = cleanhtml(date_column_values)...i'm having trouble with a blank list i've created. i have scraped a page and i have a list of dates that looks like this:..[.apr 6, 2015., .apr 5, 2015., .apr 4, 2015., .apr 3, 2015.]...my goal is to turn these dates into a database friendly format i.e. 2015-04-03..my issue is that as soon as i try to iterate through them in a for loop, the loop is treating each character separately instead of by line...so, when i do:..for line in date_values:.   print line...i get:.     [.. a. p. r.. 6. ,.. 2. 0. 1. 5. ,. ]...and so on... this is obviously not the desired result...i tried line.split() on /n and 5 in the for loop and that had no effect. so my question is, once i have my scraped list, how do i turn each line of data into separate strings?..i would appreciate any insight...thanks!"
