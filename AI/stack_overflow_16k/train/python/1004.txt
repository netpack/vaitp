"sharing util modules between actively developed apps we have a growing library of apps depending on a set of common util modules.  we'd like to:...share the same utils codebase between all projects.allow utils to be extended (and fixed!) by developers working on any project.have this be reasonably simple to use for devs (i.e. not a big disruption to workflow).cross-platform (no diffs for devs on macs/win/linux)...we currently do this ""manually"", with the utils versioned as part of each app.  this has its benefits, but is also quite painful to repeatedly fix bugs across a growing number of codebases.  ..on the plus side, it's very simple to deal with in terms of workflow - util module is part of each app, so on that side there is zero overhead...we also considered (fleetingly) using filesystem links or some such (not portable between os's)..i understand the implications about release testing and breakage, etc.  these are less of a problem than the mismatched utils are at the moment."
