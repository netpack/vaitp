"what is the memory cost of multiple duplicate lambda functions in blank? i'm wondering how the blank interpreter actually handles lambda functions in memory.  ..if i have the following:..def squares():.    return [(lambda x: x**2)(num) for num in range(1000)]...will this create 1000 instances of the lambda function in memory, or is blank smart enough to know that each of these 1000 lambdas is the same, and therefore store them as one function in memory?"
