"showing and returning the number of a repeated string on a function? i'm already learning blank on a online free course..now i have and exercise that i've been hours trying to do but.... i cannot see why it doesn't works....the instructions are here:.write a function called fizz_count that takes a list x as input and returns the count of the string “fizz” in that list...for example, fizz_count([""fizz"",""buzz"",""fizz""]) should return 2. (make sure your function returns the number instead of printing it.) check out the hint if you need help!..hint:.try making a counter variable (for example, count) in your function. the counter variable could initially be set to zero. after that, you can loop through the list that you take as input and increase count by one every time an item in the list is equal to the string ""fizz""...at the end, don't forget to return the number of ""fizz""s!..then here's my code:..x=[""fizz"",""bear"",""fizz""]..def fizz_count(*x):.    count=str(0).    for count in x:.        if x=='fizz':.            count=count+str(1).        return count..print fizz_count(x) #it prints ""fizz"",""bear"",""fizz"" but the thing that i want is to                 .                    #print ""2"" because ""fizz"" is two times in that string.."
