"trying to replace a list of strings with another list of strings in a bigger string? i'm starting to tunnel on this code and would like someone's guidance. basically, i want to replace my blank_space in my string driver_knowldege_test with the list answer_1. i would like it to go in order too (which is why i'm using the index), but this is where i also found myself stuck. i'm not even sure if the words are replacing each other properly either...driver_knowledge_test = ""when you're going to drive it is important to .always put on your ___1___, including your passengers. nif there are no .lanes marked on the road, you should drive in the ___2___ side of the road.             .nit's getting dark and the sun is fading, you should turn on the ___3___. .nbefore driving on a freeway, you should make sure you have enough ___4___, .oil, water and the correct tyre pressure."".answer_1 = ['seatbelts', 'left', 'light', 'fuel']..blank_space = [""___1___"", ""___2___"", ""___3___"", ""___4___""]..def replace_blank_space(blank, sentence, answer):.replaced = [].sentence = sentence.split().answer = 0.blank_space = 0.for word in sentence:.    replacements = finding_blank(word, list_of_blank).    if word_to_be_replaced != none:.        word = word.replace(replacements, answer).        replaced.append(word).        answer += 1.        blank_space += 1.    else:.        replaced.append(word).replaced = "" "".join(replaced).return replaced..def finding_blank(word, list_of_blank):.for ea_blank in blank_space:.    if ea_blank in blank_space: #this equals to teh whole list..        return ea_blank.return none.....print replace_blank_space(blank_space, driver_knowledge_test, answer_1)"
