"list of functions and function args i was wonder about the performance about some of the options for zipmap described in this post here. ..(i'm still new here, so i couldn't comment on that thread)...in particular, i'm interested in comparing the list comprehension: ..[f(x) for f,x in zip(functions, values)]...to the map call:..map(lambda f,x: f(x), functions, values)...i've heard the lambda is expensive, but won't map involve fewer function calls?..thanks!"
