"convert nested brackets into decimals i have only just started working with blank and one of the exercises i got from my tutor is to convert a tuple (number of nested brackets) into decimals; i have been working on this for hours now, but i got nowhere....e.g..input = (((()))).output = 3..i started like this:..def add (x,y):.    if y == '()':.        return x.        else:.        length = len(y).        return successor(add (x,y[1:length-1]))...could anyone give me a hint where iÂ´ve gone wrong - please!!!!"
