"is there a way to vary node colours randomly on a graph using networkx? i am drawing a graph using networkx and i am looking for a way to vary the colours of each node to make the graph a bit more colourful as it is quite blend at the moment. the columns in my dataframe where i am taking my values from are: source = 'tarifname', target = 'suburb' &amp; values are in a column called 'tendered_amount'...second question is, is it possible to vary the length of the edge by the values in the 'tendered_amount' column?..i have written a code which produces the graph ok, but i am struggling with the use of colours on the nodes...`fg = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(rusape, source='trfname', .target='suburb',edge_attr='tendered_amount',).plt.figure(1,figsize=(12,12)).nx.draw_networkx(fg, font_size =10,with_labels=true).plt.show()`...i have also tried the following code, but all nodes with a degree of 1 are coloured the same, which is what i am trying to avoid...`plt.figure(1,figsize=(12,12)).node_color = [fg.degree(v) for v in fg].nx.draw_networkx(fg, font_size .=10,node_color=node_color,with_labels=true).plt.show()`...can you please assist with a tweak to the above codes to generate different colours...thank you"
