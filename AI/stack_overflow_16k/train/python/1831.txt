"in blank, how to use singleton pattern? my code is :..  class handler():..        # make it static.        from pymongo import mongoclient.        client = mongoclient(""localhost"", 27017).        db = client.newsdb.        news = db.news...i want to make the client variable to be static, so is above code the correct way to do that ? i also want to use singleton pattern, because maybe the mongoclient is very large element, and i want to new() this element when i really need it......how can i do that in blank ? as a beginner, maybe ask some stupid question, sorry for that in advance..."
