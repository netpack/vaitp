"how to iterate over a range of permutations? say you have n items each ranging from 1-100. how can i get go over all possible variations within the range?..example:..3 stocks a, b and c...working to find possible portfolio allocation. ..a - 0     0   0            1    2          1    1.b - 0     1   2      ...   0    0    ...   1    2.c - 100   99  98           99   98         98   97...looking for an efficient way to get a matrix of all possible outcomes...sum should add up to 100 and cover all possible variations for n elements."
