"how to receive msb ans lsb values to convert on integer blank i have a problem with my code...i need to receive a msb and lsb 10 bits data from a picaxe kit, but i dont know how i can convert the msb ans lsb on integer that can i use...i try that, but dont works..    for x in range(1,400,10):.    msb = ser.read(2).    lsb = ser.read(2).....    datos = (msb*256)+lsb.    print datos.    degree = float(int(datos,2))...    linea = (432,200)     .    linea_len = 100 .    x = linea[0] + math.cos(math.radians(degree)) * linea_len .    y = linea[1] + math.sin(math.radians(degree)) * linea_len...how can i receive the msb and lsb from picaxe by serial??..thanks you"
