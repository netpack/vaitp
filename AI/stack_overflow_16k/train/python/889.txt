"prompt for name without any variables how would go about writing this program without any variables? it's super simple exercise from the book ""57 programming exercises"" but other than using importing sys and using the command line argv i don't see how to go about it. i think the intent is for it not to use sys.argv. thank you...inp = raw_input(""what is your name? "").print ""hello,"",inp,""nice to meet you!"""
