"class members also creates instance members in blank it seems that blank class members also are ""secretly"" copied to instance members, i have never heard of this. is this described somewhere?..here is a small example i did to investigate this (blank 3.6.7 ubuntu 18:04). ..class a:.    a = 'hello'  # class member..    def __init__(self):.        print(self.a)    # a has also become a instance member.        self.a = 'hi'    # change the instance member of a.        print(a.a)       # class member a unchanged...a = a()"
