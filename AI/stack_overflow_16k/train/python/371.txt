"blank built-in integer object i read an article that blank retains some number objects for better performance. for example:..x = 3.y = 3.print(id(x)).print(id(y))...gives out same values, which means that x and y are referencing to exactly same object. the article suggested that the retained number objects are approximately in range 1~100...so i tested following code for getting the exact range:..for i in range(-1000,1000):.    x = int(str(i)).    y = int(str(i)).    if str(id(x)) == str(id(y)):.        print(i)...and the result is quite weird: it prints out -5~256..i'm wondering how these two magic numbers came from and why they're being used. also, will these two values change in different environment?.thanks!"
