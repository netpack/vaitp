"blank server-client relationship over network problems i wrote a program for my networking class that measures upload and download speeds by sending a file over a socket and timing the transfer, and i used blank. the problem i'm having is that the server and client can talk just fine when running on the same machine, but as soon as i put the server program on another machine on my network, no file transfer happens. they talk to each other (client says ""connected to server"" and server says ""connection from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"") but the file transfer size and speed are shown as 0 and 0. ..here's the server code:..import util.import socket.import os.import shutil.s = socket.socket(socket.af_inet, socket.sock_stream).host = """".port = 12345.f = open(""receivedfromclient.txt"", ""r+"").print ""waiting for clients..."".s.bind((host, port)).s.listen(5).c, addr = s.accept().print ""client connected:"", addr.start = time.clock().msg = c.recv(257024).stop = time.clock().duration = stop-start.f.write(str(msg)).b = os.path.getsize(""receivedfromclient.txt"").print ""file size = "", b, ""bits"".print ""time to transfer from client  = "", duration, "" seconds"".bw = (b/duration)/1048576.print ""the upload bit rate is "", bw, ""mpbs"".f.close().shutil.copy(""receivedfromclient.txt"", ""sendtoclient.txt"").f.open(""sendtoclient.txt"").c.send(f.read()).f.close().c.close().s.close()...and the client code is similar:..s = socket.socket(socket.af_inet, socket.sock_stream).host = raw_input(""please enter host address: "")#socket.gethostname().port = 12345.sendfile = raw_input(""please enter name of file to transfer: "").f = open(sendfile,""rb"").g = open(""receivedfromserver.txt"",""w"").print ""connecting to "", host, port.s.connect((host, port)).s.send(f.read())...and so on. can anybody tell me what i'm doing wrong here?"
