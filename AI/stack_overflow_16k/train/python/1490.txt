"nested loop in managing two files blank tonight i have a problem with creating file from two files. i would like to achieve text file which will contain 3 first columns from first file and two 2 columns from the second file. till now i have done good reading and concatenating for this files but finally i achieve not every lines but just one concatenated in a right way. :( ..files have structure presented below: .file1:..data1 data2 data3 ...... .data1 data2 data3 ...... ...file2:..data1 data2 data3' data4 .....data1 data2 data3' data4 .......outputfile:..data1 data2 data3 data3' data4.data1 data2 data3 data3' data4...as i said right now i achieved only one row in right way not every . file 1 and file 2 haven't got the same amount of rows. data1 and data2 in both input files have to be the same. .problem is somewhere in for loop because i cannot acheive the full file :(.i will be ver very gratefull for error correction of my code ..file1 = open('file1.txt', 'r').file2 = open('file2.txt', 'r').finalfile =  none.for line in file1:.    row1 = line.rstrip().split().    first_column1 = row1[0].    second_column1 = row1[1].    #print(str(first_two_columns1)+ "" ""+ str(first_three_columns1)+ ""n"").    for line in file2:.        row2 = line.rstrip().split().        first_column2 = row2[0].        second_column2 = row2[1].        #print(str(first_two_columns1)+ "" ""+ str(first_two_columns2)+ ""n"").        if(float(first_column1) == float(first_column2)) and (second_column1 == second_column2):.            rows = row1[0] + "" "" + row1[1] + "" "" + row1[2] + "" "" + row2[2] + "" "" + row2[3] + ""n"" .            final_filename = 'final_file_{}.txt'.format(row1[0]).            finalfile = open(final_filename, ""w"").        finalfile.write(rows).if finalfile:.    finalfile.close().file1.close().file2.close()"
