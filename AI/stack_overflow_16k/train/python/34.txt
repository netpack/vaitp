"is it possible to register blank vm inputs and replay them? note: i don't know how the blank virtual machine works..if blank has a vm, it wouldn't be possible to register every generic input (like standard input, socket reading, file reading) into a log file in order to replay it to get a very similar results?..i was thinking about this possibility because i imagine that a user, who has found a bug in my program, could send to me this log file, which contains everything he has done...it could be useful or is my thought faulty? if not, how it could be achieved? does exist something similar?"
