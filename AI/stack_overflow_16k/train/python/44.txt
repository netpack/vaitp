"remove certain filetypes in blank i am running a script that walks a directory structure and generates new files in each folder in the directory. i want to delete some of the files right after creation. this is my idea, but it is quite wrong i imagine:..directory = os.path.dirname(obj).m = meshexporterapplication(directory).os.remove(os.path.join(directory,""*.mesh.xml""))...how to you put wildcards in a path? i guess not like /home/me/*.txt, but that is what i am trying...thanks,.gareth"
