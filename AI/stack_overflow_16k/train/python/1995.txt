"'str' object has no attribute - imported file object not recognizing one of its methods? i have been fiddling around trying to make a personal organizer. each day is rendered as an object containing the number of hours spent on several given activities. it also, ideally, allows the user to save this info to a file and to import from previous entries...here is the code:..class day:..def __init__(self, date, hours, blank, math, story, phil, medi):..    self.date = int(date).    self.hours = float(hours).    self.blank = float(blank).    self.math = float(math).    self.story = float(story).    self.phil = float(phil).    self.medi = float(medi)..def getday(self):.    return repr((self.date, self.hours, self.blank, self.math, self.story, self.phil, self.medi))..def getdaylist(self):.    return list(self.date, self.hours, self.blank, self.math, self.story, self.phil, self.medi).....def getinfo():..#the following allows the user to import an existing file with one object per line..question = input(""enter new information or import an existing file(new/imp)"")..if question[0] == ""i"" or question[0] == ""i"":..    filename = input(""what is the name of the file you would like to import?"")..    infile = open(filename, ""r"")....    daylist = []..    for line in infile:..        daylist.append(line)..    print(daylist)...    return daylist...    infile.close()....#the following allows the user to write objects to a new file or append objects to an existing file.#though i have not tested the latter feature..elif question[0] == ""n"" or question[0] == ""n"":..    question2 = input(""would you like to append this new info to an existing file or write it to a new file(a/w)? hit blank ente to exit"").    filename = input(""enter filename for new information"").    outfile = open(filename, question2)..    daylist = []   .    while question2 != """":..        date = input(""please enter date (in single string)"").        hours = input(""please enter total hours for the day"").        blank = input(""please enter total hours of blank"").        math = input(""please enter total hours of math"").        story = input(""please enter total hours of story writing"").        phil = input(""please enter total hours of philosophy"").        medi = input(""please enter total hours of meditation"")..        #creates object.        dayobject = day(date, hours, blank, math, story, phil, medi).        daylist.append(dayobject).        question2 = input(""would you ;like to enter more info now (enter 'yes' or hit blank enter to conclude)"")..    #writes each object to the file.    for item in daylist:..        print(item, file=outfile)...    return daylist..    outfile.close()....def main():...daylist = getinfo()..test = daylist[0]..print(test)..print(test.getday())...main()...when i create a new file, i can use methods on the object: getday(), for example, returns the various aspects of the class (date, hours, blank, etc.). when i import the same file using the code in the first half of the getinfo() function, however, i get this error message:..traceback (most recent call last):.file ""/users/rainydaycart/documents/po2.py"", line 101, in &lt;module&gt;.main().file ""/users/rainydaycart/documents/po2.py"", line 98, in main.print(test.getday()).attributeerror: 'str' object has no attribute 'getday'...when i print the newly made object it appears to be an object and not a string. why can't i execute the getday() method, which is part of the class definition, when i import the same object from the file?..p.s. indents appear to be a little screwey in this post with the function heads(modules?), but they are not a problem when i run the file."
