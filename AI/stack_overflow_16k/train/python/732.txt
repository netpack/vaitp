"how do you open a csv file in blank without using the ""with"" syntax? i am unfamiliar with the csv library and the ""with open"" syntax that i see around online sources including stackoverflow use it for processing csv files. ..here is the ""with syntax"" i was talking about, it only seems to process the correct amount of lines with this code...how would i do it with the first block of code shown?"
