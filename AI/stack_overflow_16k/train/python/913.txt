"how can i get re patterns as dynamic input in blank? i'm using re module in blank for some regex operations .its working fine when i have defined the pattern to be matched statically in a blank program...for example,..import re.s=""hi can you help me out"".pattern=r'[a-z ]*' #pattern that takes space and lower case letters only.i= re.fullmatch(pattern,s) #to check the entire string.print(i.string)...output:.hi can you help me out...now let me come to the problem i have faced is, if i tried to take the input pattern from user in run time it throws exception .here the code..import re.s=""hi can you help me out"".pattern=input(""enter pattern:"").i= re.fullmatch(pattern,s).print(i.string)..output:.enter pattern:r'[a-z]*'.exception has occurred: attributeerror.'nonetype' object has no attribute 'string'...hope someone help me to sort out this problem...blank version:3.5..thanks in advance"
