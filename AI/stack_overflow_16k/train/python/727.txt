"unable to create set as value to a dictionary i am trying to create a set as a value to a dictionary...fd = {}.fs = set().fd['a'] = fs.add('x').fd['a'] = fs.add('y')...the set is indeed created properly:..print(fs).{'x','y'}...but the dictionary does not contain the set as the value...print(fd).{'a':none}...i thought any object can be a value in a dictionary. why don't i get the set as the value for the given simple string key?"
