"incrementing in a for loop so my issue is with this not incrementing correctly... i tried to uses an int ""step"" to + 1 every time this loop is ran but it doesn't do anything. why is that? also when i print(step) it only adds up to 337. it does not go the full 1000 like i had thought i asked it too. how do i do this correctly?..lockers = []..step = 3..locker = 0..while len(lockers) &lt;= 1000:.     lockers.append(1)..for i in range(0, len(lockers)):.     lockers[i] = 0..for i in range(0, len(lockers), 2):.     lockers[i] = 1..for i in range(0, len(lockers), step):.     if lockers[i] == 0:.          lockers [i] = 1.     else:.          lockers[i] = 0..     step += 1...print(lockers)"
