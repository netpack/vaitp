"how to interpret (read) signed 24bits data from 32bits i have raw file containing signed 24bits data packed into 32bits.example:..00 4d 4a ff .00 ff ff ff...i would like read those data and get signed integer between [-2^23 and 2^23-1]..for now i write ..  int32_1 = file1.read(4).  val1 = (( unpack('=l', int32_1)[0] &amp; 0xffffff00)&gt;&gt;8...but how to take the 2-complement into account to interpret 00ffffff as -1 ?"
