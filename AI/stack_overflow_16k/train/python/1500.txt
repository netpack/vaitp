"using blank to encapsulate part of a string after 3 commas i am trying to create a blank script that adds quotations around part of a string, after 3 commas..so if the input data looks like this:..1234,1,1/1/2010,this is a test. one, two, three....i want blank to convert the string to:..1234,1,1/1/2010,""this is a test. one, two, three.""...the quotes will always need to be added after 3 commas..i am using blank 3.1.2 and have the following so far:..i_file=open(""input.csv"",""r"").o_file=open(""output.csv"",""w"")..for line in i_file:.        tokens=line.split("","").        count=0.        new_line="""".        for element in tokens:.                if count = ""3"":.                        new_line = new_line + '""' + element + '""'.                        break.                else:.                        new_line = new_line + element + "","".                        count=count+1..        o_file.write(new_line + ""n"").        print(line, "" -&gt; "", new_line)..i_file.close().o_file.close()...the script closes immediately when i try to run it and produces no output..can you see what's wrong?..thanks"
