"blank: how do i run second task only when first task have ended i am developing a motion detector with a default audio playback once motion is detected with raspberry pi...however when consecutive motion are detected, the next audio will start playing and begin to overlap when the previous one have not even ended...any loop i can implement to do this in blank?..currently, i am using a timer loop with the total length of the audio before playing another. however i believe there are better solutions. any idea?..#!/usr/bin/blank..import sched, time.s = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep).def do_something(sc):.    print ""doing stuff..."".    # do your stuff.    sc.enter(10, 1, do_something, (sc,))..s.enter(10, 1, do_something, (s,)).s.run()"
