blankic way of doing so? i wish to have the following simple algorithm implemented in blank..here is the pseudo-code for it...for elem in mylist:.    if only one elem satisfies mycondition:.        returns it.    if more than one satisfies mycondition:.        randomly return one out of them.    if none satisfies mycondition:.        randomly return any one...i surely can implement it in a c-style snippet. but i am here looking for the most blankic way of doing so.
