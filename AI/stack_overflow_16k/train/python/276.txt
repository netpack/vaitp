"importerror: no module named mako i have installed of blank in 2 different location. i have opened two terminals setting environment variable such a way that each terminal finds a different blank installation:..term1$which blank./a/blank..term2$which blank./b/blank...later, i installed mako using one of the installations (i don't remember which one). i installed mako locally using:..blank setup.py install --user...my understanding was that, the module will go to the path given by:..$blank -c 'import site; print site.user_site'./home/.../.local/lib/blank2.7/site-packages...which points to the same location in my /home if i run the above command from either of the terminals. .the problem is that if i run :..blank -c 'import mako'...one of the terminals is ok but the other one gives error:..importerror: no module named mako...most probably, the search path is different from one terminal(env) to another. but i don't know what to check!"
