"strange output when iterating over a dict of lists in a class week, i have created a dictionary using the .fromkey() method that contains a string key for monday-saturday and initializes them all to an empty list: ..self.weekdict = dict.fromkeys(daynamelist, [])...i have a function that then iterates over a list of employees, and, within each iteration, iterates over their work days and appends an employee to the corresponding weekdict list of each day:..def setweekdict(employees):.            for employee in employees:.                for day in employees[employee].workdays:.                    self.weekdict[day].append(employee).                    print ""employee: "" + employee.                    print ""weekday/list: "" + str(day) + str(self.weekdict[day])...i expect the weekdict lists to reflect everyone who is scheduled to work on a given day. instead, it appears that the list for each day accumulates the total number of times i've iterated over each day for the employee. my print statements output this: ..employee: addison.weekday/list: saturday['addison'].employee: addison.weekday/list: monday['addison', 'addison'].employee: addison.weekday/list: tuesday['addison', 'addison', 'addison'].employee: addison.weekday/list: wednesday['addison', 'addison', 'addison', 'addison'].employee: addison.weekday/list: thursday['addison', 'addison', 'addison', 'addison', 'addison']...obviously i only want 'addison' or any other employee to appear once per day, and i can't understand what in my for loop would be contributing to each list adding the employee name + the amount of times the employee name has been added to other lists before. i can only think that dict.fromkeys() creates keys that actually all point to the same list, but i didn't think that was how the fromkeys() function worked."
