attributeerror: 'int' object has no attribute 'isdigit' and nameerror i am trying to make a program in which if i enter a positive number then it executes further but if i enter a negative number or a letter it should print 'house price must be a positive number' and it should ask for the input again. this is what i've done so far but when i enter an number i get an attributeerror and when i enter a letter i get a nameerror...import math..while true:.    home_price = input('enter the price of your dreams house').    if home_price.isdigit():.        if home_price &gt; 0:    .            home_price = int(house_price).            break.        else:.            print('house price must be a positive number only')
