save multiple variable from an array i am trying to get the three values i've retrieved from a db into three different variables...here is what i did:..for db_values in c.fetchall():.    a = ''.join(str(db_values)).    print a..    a1 = (a[0:18])   (want to manipulate the sequence eventually).    a2 = (a[9])..    print a1.    print a2..    &gt;&gt;&gt; 3459341.    &gt;&gt;&gt; 3459342.    &gt;&gt;&gt; 3448743..    &gt;&gt;&gt; 3459341..[error] indexerror ( index out of range: 8 )...so i understand why it is out of range as one line only contains 7 characters..using the fetchone and manipulate the record works just fine...could somebody let me know what the best approach is to save the second value retrieved from the db into a variable so i can manipulate it?
