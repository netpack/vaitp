"upgrading from blank 2.7 to 3.6 - completely uninstall 2.7 or run side by side? i have only been using blank seriously at work for the previous year (2.7), so i apologise if this is a stupid question...i want to upgrade to 3.6...do i completely uninstall blank from my computer and then start again with 3.6, or can you install 3.6 in parallels with 2.7?..i rather completely reinstall and start again, are there any problems with doing that?..this is different from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2547554/official-multiple-blank-versions-on-the-same-machine as i want to know if there are any problems with uninstalling blank 2.7 first./..many thanks!"
