"gzipping files from blank is changing the file names i am trying to gzip files using blank 3. when i gzip the files, the code is changing the filename without me doing anything. i am not sure i totally understand the working of gzip module...below is the code:..dir_in = '/localfolder/new_files/'.dir_out = '/localfolder/zippedfiles/.file_name = 'transactions_may05'.def gzip_files(dir_in, dir_out, file_name):.    with open(dir_in + file_name, 'rb') as f_in, gzip.open(dir_out + 'unprocessed.' + file_name + '.gz', 'wb') as f_out:.        f_out.writelines(f_in)...expected output:.outer file: unprocessed.transactions_may05.gz.when i double click it, i should get the original file transactions_may05..current output:.outer file: unprocessed.transactions_may05.gz -- as expected.when i double click it the internal file also has unprocessed. appended to it. i am not sure why unprocessed. gets appended to internal file name.internal file:unprocessed.transactions_may05..any help would be appreciated. thank you."
