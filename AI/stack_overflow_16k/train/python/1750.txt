"removing first character in a string leaves whitespace i have a textfile that looks like this:..6 hello world...i'm reading it in as such:..with open(""test.txt"") as fp:.    for line in fp:.        l = line.split("" "").        print(l)...which prints me the entire string:..6 hello world...i want to remove the '6' character, and just store the string 'hello world' in another string:..i've done this..newstr = l.replace(l[0],"""")...which now gives me:.. hello world...now i want to remove the leading space, and store the string..i tried this:..newstr2 = newstr.replace(newstr[0],"""").print(newstr2)...but this prints:..helloworld...instead of hello world (no leading space character).what am i doing wrong here?.also, using len() on newstr2 tells me the length is 11, even though it's 10. is len() including a newline character?"
