"is there a way to break out of list comprehension? when using infinite generators, i can use if to prevent items from entering the list, but not in order to break the loop...this will actually crash and hang. not even keyboardinterrupt can save me (why is that btw?)..import itertools.a = [x for x in itertools.count() if x&lt;10]...while if i use my own infinite generator..def mygen():.    i=0.    while true:.        yield i.        i +=1...this will run until keyboardinterrupt..a = [x for x in mygen() if x&lt;10]...now, obviously for a proper for loop we can break when a condition is met..a = [].for x in itertools.count():.    a.append(x).    if x&gt;9:.        break...so my question: is there some way to break out of list comprehension?"
