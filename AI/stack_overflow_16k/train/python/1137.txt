"fastest way to remove all multiple occurrence items from a list? what is the fastest way to remove all multiple occurrence items from a list of arbitrary items (in my example a list of lists)? in the result, only items that occur a single time in the list should show up, thus removing all duplicates...input: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 2]]..output: [[1, 3], ]..this solution was slow:..output = [item for item in input if input.count(item)==1]...this solution was faster:..duplicates = [].output = [].for item in input:.    if not item in duplicates:.        if item in output:.            output.remove(item).            duplicates.append(item).        else:.           output.append(item)...is there any better solution, probably by first sorting the list? any ideas are appreciated."
