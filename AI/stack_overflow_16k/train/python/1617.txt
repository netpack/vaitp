"concatenate files content in one file using blank i have in a directory 'c:/users/lamda/desktop/ml working/logs/a/' multiple sub-directories and each sub-directory contains a bunch of files.my goal is to concatenate all these files in one file 'c:/users/lamda/desktop/ml working/logs/concatenate.log'.i have wrote the following blank code but it only succeeds in copying one file content in 'c:/users/lamda/desktop/ml working/logs/concatenate.log'.i'm doubting that there a missing for loop but could not really figure out the issue.please help me ..import glob.import os.path.directories = os.listdir('c:/users/lamda/desktop/ml working/logs/a').for i in directories:.    files = os.listdir('c:/users/lamda/desktop/ml working/logs/a/' + i).    print(files[1:]).    files2 = files[1:].    for j in files2 :       .        fs = open('c:/users/lamda/desktop/ml working/logs/a/'+i+'/'+j,'r').        fd = open('c:/users/lamda/desktop/ml working/logs/concatenate.log','w').        #print(i).        #print(j).        for ligne in fs :.            fd.write(ligne).fd.close().fs.close()"
