"typeerror: string indices must be numbers, not object (blank) i'm trying to create a long calculation calculator ( does long division, addition etc.) while in the long division section i'm trying to get the number to divide with but i can't (as in numdiv)..ex: in 240 / 12, the number i'm trying to find is 24, then i'll have another loop that will add 12 to find 2 (as in 24/12 is 2)...here is my code:..##############.#number is bigger (or equal) to number 2..number = 19000.operation = '/'.number2 = 12..##############..import math..longer = len(str(number)).shorter = len(str(number2)).if operation == '/':.    print str(number2) + '/' + str(number).for i in range(longer - 1):.    if int(str(number)[0, i]) &gt;= number2:.        numdiv = int(str(number)[0, i]).for i in range(1, math.trunc(numdiv / number2)):.    if number2 * (i + 1) &gt;= numdiv:.        print (shorter + 1) * ' ' + number * i...the error is 5 lines from the end where i did..if int(str(number)[0, i]) &gt;= number2:...it said..typeerror: string indices must be numbers, not object...new..i tried doing..if str(number)[:i] &gt;= number2:.        numdiv = str(number)[:i].for i in range(1, math.trunc(numdiv / number2)):.    if number2 * (i + 1) &gt;= numdiv:.        print (shorter + 1) * ' ' + number * i...numdiv in this case is trying to be an integer and doing this causes the problem:..valueerror: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''...how do i fix this?"
