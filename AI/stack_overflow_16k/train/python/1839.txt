"is it possible to pass member variable names as arguments? i was wondering if such a construction was possible in blank :..class a():.    def method1(self):.        print ('method 1')..    def method2(self):.        print ('method 2')...a = a().call_method(a, 'method1').call_method(a, 'method2')...expected result :.method 1.method 2..how to define call_method ?..thanks in advance"
