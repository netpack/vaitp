"how to remove spaces between letters and print them on one line? i am stuck guys.....i have a for loop that works perfectly, but i don't know how to remove spaces. i tried using the sep="""" in the print function, but that didn't work out. i get this error: ...  ""sytnax error while detecting tuple""...what i want to achieve is this:...  abcd.... (so glued together, on one.  line)....i've placed them on one line, like this:..for letter in range(96,126): .    a_y = chr(letter)..    print(a_y),...hence the , which i use to print them all on one line. my question: is this approach correct?..and the other one: how on earth can i glue the outputs together? i tried using append and sep="""", but both just don't work. am i doing something wrong?"
