"issue with the final list print of obtaining prime divisors from a number the only problem i am obtaining from doing this is that the program prints a list.that shows, say n = 11, the final outcome will print [2, 2, 3], when i just want [11]. that's how it is for most tests as well, it will have the numbers i need but extra ones as well. ..    base = 2.    divisors = [ ] .    while n &gt; 1:.        if n % base == 0:.            divisors.append(base).            n = (n / base).        else:.            base += 1 + base % 2 .    return (divisors)"
