"how to create a list() of partially sequenced alphanumeric items? i thought it rather simple but can't figure out by myself. i have a range of non-continuous items, like this:..farm011 - farm018, farm020, farm022 - farm033, farm041 - farm052, ........which i want to put in a list(). what's the easiest way of doing that? just to make it clear[er], i think the list should look like this: ..myitem = ['farm011','farm012','farm013','farm014','farm020','farm022','farm023','farm024','farm25',....]...i'm sorry if it's already answered here and i didn't find it. thanks in advance. cheers!! ...update 1: error message from eyquem code..i copied &amp; pasted the code exactly as you wrote and this is what i get in error: ..file ""./test.py"", line 11.    gen = ( (""%s%03d""%(w1,i) for i in range(int(s),int(e)+1)) if w2.                               ^.syntaxerror: invalid syntax"
