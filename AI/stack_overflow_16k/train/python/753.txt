"how to ignore numbers when doing string.startswith() in blank? i have a directory with a large number of files. the file names are similar to the following: the(number)one(number), where (number) can be any number. there are also files with the name: the(number), where (number) can be any number. i was wondering how i can count the number of files with the additional ""one(number)"" at the end of their file name...let's say i have the list of file names, i was thinking of doing..for n in list:.    if n.startswith(the(number)one):.        add one to a counter...is there anyway for it to accept any number in the (number) space when doing a startswith?..example:.the34one5.the37one2.the444one3.the87one8.the34.the32..this should return 4."
