"breaking up columns in a simple csv file my csv file looks like this: ..test number,score .1,100 2,40 3,80 4,90. ...i have been trying to figure out how to write a code that ignores the header + first column and focuses on scores because the assignment was to find the averages of the test scores and print out a float(for those particular numbers the output should be 77.5). i've looked online and found pieces that i think would work but i'm getting errors every time. were learning about read, realines, split, rstrip and n if that helps! i'm sure the answer is so simple, but i'm new to coding and i have no idea what i'm doing. thank you!..def calculatetestaverage(filename):.    myfile = open(filename, ""r"").    column = myfile.readline().rstrip(""n"").    for column in myfile:.        scorecolumn = column.split("","").        (scorecolumn[1])..this is my code so far my professor wanted us to define a function and go from there using the stuff we learned in lecture. i'm stuck because it's printing out all the scores i need on separate returned lines, yet i am not able to sum those without getting an error. thanks for all your help, i don't think i would be able to use any of the suggestions because we never went over them. if anyone has an idea of how to take those test scores that printed out vertically as a column and sum them that would help me a ton!"
