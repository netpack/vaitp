"centering ascii graphics blank so i read that to print ascii graphics you need to use the following print format:  ..print(  .""""""...""""""  .)...however, """""" """""""".center(width) doesn't work with this, and i want my picture to be centered in the terminal. how can i achieve this?..example attached for clarity: . (notice that ascii picture isnt centered whereas an ordinary string was centered)"
