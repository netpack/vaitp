"group given list elements using certain criteria i have a list of 5 polygons as follows:..from itertools import compress.from shapely.geometry import polygon..  polys = [&lt;shapely.geometry.polygon.polygon object at 0x000002d634217668&gt;.     &lt;shapely.geometry.polygon.polygon object at 0x000002d634217780&gt;.     &lt;shapely.geometry.polygon.polygon object at 0x000002d6341f9080&gt;.     &lt;shapely.geometry.polygon.polygon object at 0x000002d634217fd0&gt;.     &lt;shapely.geometry.polygon.polygon object at 0x000002d634217f60&gt;]...i have to group them into the intersecting polys:..results = [].for poly in polys:.    indices = [poly.intersects(p) for p in polys].    intersect_polys = list(compress(polys, indices)).    results.append(intersect_polys)   ...note: poly.intersects returns true if they intersect, otherwise false.that's only the use of shapely here...edit:.based on comments @aran-fey:..in the case of 3 polygons, for example, https://i.imgur.com/ektokk9.png[a,b,c], it's possible for b to intersect with both a and c even if a and c don't intersect...the result would be:..[[b,c], [b,a]]...i have to find all such groups..since order of polygons is not important, should also remove the duplicate groups (containing same polygons)"
