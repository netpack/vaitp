"blank: simplest (non-pil) way to get image metadata (mainly size) i'm gathering basic metadata for images - mainly their dimensions, although it'd be nice to get any other available metadata as well. the image formats i'm interested in are png, jpg, and gif. ..i'm using pil at the moment, but it occurred to me there may be a simpler way that doesn't involve external dependencies or binary libraries. is there one?"
