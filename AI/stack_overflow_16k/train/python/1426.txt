"how to filter a nested list of urls? i am trying to filter a list of url's based on the words in the url...for example, if any part of the url contains /thema/ or /autor/ it should be deleted...sample list:..p = [['www.sample.de/fl/autor/xxx',.      'www.sample.de/fl/autor/xxx',.      'www.sample.de/fl/autor/xxx',],.      ['www.temp.de/thema/xxx',.      'www.temp.de/thema/xxx',].    ]...my code:..filters = ['/autor/', '/thema/' ]..fil = [].for sbl in p:.    for i in sbl:.        if i in filters:.            break.        fil.append(sbl).        break...however, this does not filter anything...how can i do this correctly?"
