"passing arguments in class in blank in the given code, lists x and y are randomly assigned numbers between 0-n with some probability 0.5. i am randomly choosing an agent and removing it using func1. i am adding one agent using func2. now i have defined two class objects x1 and x2. the input argument 'state1' of x2 is obtained from x1, and similarly 'state2' of x1 is obtained from x2...i am not able to find a proper way for passing arguments 'state2' and 'state1' in x1 and x2..as you can see from last four lines of my code, state1 and state2 should be defined before x1 and x2 but i can't do that as class objects x1 and x2 should be defined first as i did...what i am trying to achieve here is following: i have two populations n1 and n2. i am randomly choosing one agent(say state1) from n1 and adding it(preserving its state=state1) to n2. at the same time, i am removing one agent from n2(say state2) and adding it(preserving its state=state2) to n1 population. this process is being repeated over time with fixed time interval...can somebody tell me a proper way to do it and make code run ?..import random..class func():.    def __init__(self, n, state):.        self.n = n.        self.x = [].        self.y = []..        agents = range(self.n)..        for i in range(self.n):.            if random.random() &lt; 0.5:.                self.x.append(i).            else:.                self.y.append(i)..        agent = random.choice(agents)..    def func1(self, agent):.        if self.agent in self.x:.            self.x.remove(agent).            return 1.        elif self.agent in self.y:.            self.y.remove(agent).            return 2..    def func2(self, state):.        if state == 1:.            self.x.append(n).            return self.x.        elif state == 2:.            self.y.append(n).            return self.y..if __name__=='__main__':..    n1 = 100.    n2 = 100.    x1 = state(n1, state2).    x2 = state(n2, state1)..    state1 = func.func1().    state2 = func.func1()"
