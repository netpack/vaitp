"passing parameter and retain value after function call in blank i believe this is a simple question but still want to get a quick and clear answer to my case:..def get_query_history(idx, url, archive_location):.        idx = idx + 1.    return idx    # i meant to return the idx's value (end up 1000 for every call) and used it in the next loop in main..main:..    idx = 1 .    while current &lt;= end_date:.        with open(archive_location, 'a') as the_archive:.            get_query_history(idx, url, archive_location)  # i want to increase the idx every time i call the function...apparently this is not the way i should take in blank, can anyone enlighten me?"
