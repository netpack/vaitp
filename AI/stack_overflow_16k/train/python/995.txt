"finding which values are causing runtimewarning i have a function that accepts a big numerical list and then compute something with each value with an equation. however when i run the code i get the following:..runtimewarning: divide by zero encountered in double_scalars...i would like a way to print only the item that is causing the error. how can i do that?..def foo(list):.    result = none.    for x in list:.        result = 1/x #makes the warning.    return result...of course x would be zero, but i would like to find the index of x in the list that is doing this error...edit: .is it possible to do that using try? or should it be done only using if?"
