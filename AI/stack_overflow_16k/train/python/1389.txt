"removing empty lines from csv file using blank i am creating a code that will calculate means of the first 5 rows. however, i cannot think of the way to remove a row if it initially was left empty. here is the sketch of my code. sorry if it is primitive,i am still a novice.thanks!..import csv.import statistics.with open('test.csv') as file:. data=csv.reader(file,delimiter=',').. sample1=[]. sample2=[]. sample3=[]. sample4=[]. sample5=[]. #i was trying to do something like that but then. #i receive error message that states that statistics.mean requires at least. #one value.. #(for row in data:.    #if row:.        #some=row[1]). for row in data:..    sp1=row[0].    sample1.append(sp1).    sample1=[int(x) for x in sample1].    sp2=row[1].    sample2.append(sp2).    sample2=[int(x) for x in sample2].    sp3=row[2].    sample3.append(sp3).    sample3=[int(x) for x in sample3].    sp4=row[3].    sample4.append(sp4).    sample4=[int(x) for x in sample4].    sp5=row[4].    sample5.append(sp5).    sample5=[int(x) for x in sample5].. mean1=statistics.mean(sample1). mean2=statistics.mean(sample2). mean3=statistics.mean(sample3). mean4=statistics.mean(sample4). mean5=statistics.mean(sample5). print(mean1). print(mean2). print(mean3). print(mean4). print(mean5)"
