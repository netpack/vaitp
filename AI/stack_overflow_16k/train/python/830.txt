"how to avoid to manually set the initial value of a variable in a recursive function? i found this solution for the euler project 5 (what is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?) with a variable range of integer values to divide evenly by: ..def euler5(start, end, counter):.    x = counter.    while start &lt;= end:.        if x%counter == x%start:.            return euler5(start+1, end, x).        else:.            x += counter.    return x...i do however have to manually set the counter to the smallest integer value (initial counter = start value). is there a way to automatically do this and to maintain the algorithm?"
