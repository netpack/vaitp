"make this a one-liner: `return sum[dict.get(char) for char in word]` obviously, the title has code that can't be interpreted. an uninformative ..syntaxerror: invalid syntax...stderr message didn't tell me much, so i threw it in line by line, using:..[dict.get(['val','val','foo'])]...and have since discovered that dict.get() and iterables don't play well together...if you haven't already guessed, i'm in the exciting field of building toy programs for learning and amusement. here's my code:..def wordpoints(word):.    points = 0.    for char in word:.        points += dict.get(char).    return points...here's what i want:..def wordpoints(word):.    return sum[dict.get(char) for char in word]...for clarification, dict is named tile_p in my code, and stands for tile points. there is another def that looks up the scrabble player's dictionary for true|false results in a mysql table, and passes it to this function if it cursor.fectchone() has something in it."
