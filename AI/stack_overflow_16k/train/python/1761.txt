"list comprehension - use each element twice i have two lists as follows:..first = [1, 2, 3] # integers.second = [""a"", ""b""]...i want to produce the following list, with alternating a and b. notice that the resulting iterable is longer than the input iterables:..[""1a"", ""1b"", ""2a"", ""2b"", ""3a"", ""3b""]...i am currently using itertools:..[str(x1) + x2 for x1, x2 in itertools.product(first, second)]...but is this the ""nicest"" way? is there a solution which doesn't require an import?"
