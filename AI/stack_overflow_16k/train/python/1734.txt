"how to offer platform-specific implementations of a module? i need to make one function in a module platform-independent by offering several implementations, without changing any files that import it. the following works:..do_it = getattr(__import__(__name__), ""do_on_"" + sys.platform).....but breaks if the module is put into a package...an alternative would be an if/elif with hard-coded calls to the others in do_it()...anything better?"
