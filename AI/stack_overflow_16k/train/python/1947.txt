"how to find all files in current directory with filenames that match a certain pattern in blank? i am trying to find all the files in the same directory as my script that has a filename matching a certain pattern. ideally, i would like to store it in an array once i get them. the pattern i need to match is something like: testing.junk.08-05.txt. all the filenames have the testing in the front and end with the date (08-05.txt). the only difference is the junk in the middle which can include any valid characters. ..what would be the most efficient way to do this? i can be working with anywhere from 1 to thousands of files? ..additional things to note: using blank 2.6 and i need this to work on unix-based operating systems."
