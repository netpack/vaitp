"how to use for and if together in blank i have a list which has 100 to 1 in decreasing order. i want to print the numbers which are divisible by 25. below code seems rights but doesn't give output...r=range(100,0,-1) #defining the list.print(list(r))    #printing the list.for t in list(r): #loop to traverse through the list.    if(t/25==0):  #condition to check divisibity test.        print(t)  #printing on satisfying the condition...i want to see 100, 75, 50, 25 after execution. i am neither getting any output nor any error with my code."
