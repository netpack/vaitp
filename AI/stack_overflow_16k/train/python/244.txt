"string being split by single quotes automatically i have a long string i am trying to use json.loads() on and cannot do so because from my understanding json only accepts double quotes and because of the length of this string, it is automatically being broken up to fit on new lines with single quotes.  is there anyway to prevent this?  ..example below in blank 2.7..string = ""a long string' .         'still going""..json.loads(string)..invalid control character fails at char #...i know it works if it is all double quotes or single quotes, but json.loads(string) isn't recognizing it when i use single quotes. ..edit:..the string with single quotes is coming in from a socket, i don't have control over that.  they are taking a single quoted string and putting double quotes on the ends so that it is in line the the json.loads method.  however the single quotes that broke up the long string remain and are causing the issue ..this is also not all the data for the json, just a single value of one."
