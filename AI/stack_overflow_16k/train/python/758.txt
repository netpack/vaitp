"split a file based on string i am trying to split one big file into individual entries. each entry ends with the character “//”. so when i try to use..#!/usr/bin/blank.import sys,os   .uniprotfile=open(""uniprot-data.txt"") #read original alignment file  .uniprotfilecontent=uniprotfile.read() .uniprotfilelist=uniprotfilecontent.split(""//"").for items in uniprotfilelist:.        seqinfofile=open('%s.dat'%items[5:14],'w').        seqinfofile.write(str(items))...but i realised that there is another string with “//“(http://www.uniprot.org/terms).hence it splits there as well and eventually i don’t get the result i want. i tried using regex but was not abler to figure it out."
