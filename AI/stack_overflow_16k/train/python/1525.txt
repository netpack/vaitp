"typeerror: 'int' object is not callable with blank i have this slice of blank code:..print(curr, nxt).print (type(curr), type(nxt)).print (type(curr[0]), type(curr[1])).print (type(nxt[0]), type(nxt[1]))..curr[0] = min(curr[0], nxt[0]).curr[1] = max(curr[1], nxt[1]).del condensed[i+1]...but when i run it, i get this output:..[3, 5] [4, 8] .&lt;class 'list'&gt; &lt;class 'list'&gt; .&lt;class 'int'&gt; &lt;class 'int'&gt; .&lt;class 'int'&gt; &lt;class 'int'&gt; ..---&gt; curr[1] = max(curr[1], nxt[1]) ..typeerror: 'int' object is not callable ...i don't understand what i am doing wrong, it seems like all the inputs to max() is fine. furthermore, it never gets an error with min(). any ideas?..if anyone wants to see the full code, it's on github and it's to solve this problem."
