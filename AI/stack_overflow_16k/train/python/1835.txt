"generate mouse velocity when only integer steps are allowed i write a simple program in blank which includes moving my mouse (i do his with pyuserinput)..however: it is only allowed to move the mouse in integer steps (say pixels)..so mouse.move(250.3,300.2) won't work...i call the move function about 30 times in a second and move the mouse a few pixels. the speed with which i move the mouse varies from 0.5-2.5px/call. rounding gives me 1-3 (move only want ints) which does not really represent the speed...i search for a solution (maybe generator?) which takes my current speed (e.g. 0.7px) and gives me back a pattern (like a pwm signal) out of 0 and 1 (e.g. 1,1,0,1,1,0...) which yields the 0.7px in average..however this generator has to be adaptive because speed is constantly changing...i am quite new to blank and stuck with the last point: the variability of the generator function...here is what i have so far:..# for 0.75px/call.def getpwm(n):.    nums = [1,0,1,1].    yield nums[n%4]"
