"iterating variable when if statement comes up false i wrote this program in blank:..num=51..if (num % 3 == 1):.    if (num%4 == 2):.        if (num%5 == 3):.            if (num%6 ==4):.                print num.            else:.                print ""not right number, try again - error 1"".        else:.            print ""not right number, try again - error 2"".    else:.        print ""not right number, try again - error 3"".else: .    print ""not right number, try again - error 4""...which works well, except i really don't want to have to hand iterate num until i get the answer i want (i wrote this to solve a mathematics problem i wanted to solve - this is not homework, though). if anyone could detail to change all of the else statements to add a statement incrementing num by one and return to the beginning of the for loop, that'd be great...thanks!"
