"giving variable name and value at the same time i have a problem. in a first step i want to create a variable that is named like the query but with df (f.e. sql_a turns into df_a). in a second step i want give this variable a value (f.e. df_a = pd.read_csv(...)). i tried a million different things, so i decided to just write down the two basic tasks i would like to accomplish and hope that maybe someone can help me out. i'm grateful for every tip!..queries = [""sql_a"": sql_a, ""sql_z"": sql_z]..def get_data_into_df():..for query_name in queries:.    df_name = query_name.replace('sql_','df_') #task 1.    df_name = pd.read_csv(sql_folder + csv_name) #task 2.    print(df_name)..get_data_into_df()...edit: my try with a dictionary. my problem is that i basically need that the new df_name (f.e. df_a) needs to match the dataframe that i'm attaching to it (pd.read_csv()). so that i get sql_a --> df_a --> correct dataframe. i dont know if it's fully clear what i mean...def get_data_into_df():.dataframes = {}.for query_name in queries:.    df_name = query_name.replace('sql_','df_').    dataframes[df_name] = query_name.print(dataframes)..get_data_into_df()...edit 2: maybe something like this..?..def get_data_into_df():.dataframes = {}.for query_name in queries:.    df_name = query_name.replace('sql_','df_').    dataframes[df_name] = query_name.    dataframes[df_name, query_name] = pd.read_csv(sql_folder + csv_name).print(dataframes)..get_data_into_df()"
