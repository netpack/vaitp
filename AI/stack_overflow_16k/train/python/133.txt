"non-negative constraint using pydstool -- not working i recently found pydstool while searching for something that could solve a system of odes and obey constraints (all i need for my graphs is that the values stay above 0 since they are modelling populations). although the documentation is rather poor, basic usage has not been that difficult, but i am coming into some trouble adding in that non-negativity constraint. ..it is as if the xdomain line  is just being completely ignored. the code below produces a plot that crosses the x-axis, so i must be doing something wrong in setting up the bounds. does anybody have any advice?..import pydstool as pdt..ini = {'a':1000,'b':1000,'c':1000}.dsargs = pdt.args(name='test',.                  ics=ini,.                  tdata = [0,20],.                  varspecs = {'a':'-100','b':'0','c':'1'},.                  xdomain = {'a':[0,pdt.inf],'b':[0,pdt.inf],'c':[0,pdt.inf],'incontact':1}).ds = pdt.generator.vode_odesystem(dsargs).traj = ds.compute('test').pts = traj.sample()...pdt.plt.plot(pts['t'],pts['a'],label='a').pdt.plt.plot(pts['t'],pts['b'],label='b').pdt.plt.plot(pts['t'],pts['c'],label='c').pdt.plt.legend().pdt.plt.xlabel('t').pdt.plt.show()"
