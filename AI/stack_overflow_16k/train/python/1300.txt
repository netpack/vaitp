"blank reading a float from a file and appending it at the end of every line i have the following text file:..0 something 0.008.0 something2 0.004.0 something3 0.003.0 something4 0.001.0 something5 0.000.1 something 0.008.1 something2 0.004.1 something3 0.003.1 something4 0.001.1 something5 0.000...and the following code which reads the file and takes only the first 3 lines starting with 0, the first 3 lines starting with 1 and so on. until now it successfully does that apart from adding the float number (marked as w in the code) in the end and i have trouble adding it due to casting...with open('output.txt', mode = 'r') as f:   .    max = 3                             .    i = 0.    weight=0.    output = [].    while true:.        line = f.readline().strip()       .        if line == '':                    .            break .        line = line.split()  .        i = int(line[0]).        w=float(line[2]) # i want to add this at the end of every line as well...        try:.            output[i].        except indexerror:.            for i in range(len(output), i + 1):.                output.append([])         .        if len(output[i]) &lt; max:        .            output[i].append(line[1]) ...for i, j in enumerate(output):.    print(i, *j)     ...desired output:..0 something 0.008 something2 0.004 something3 0.003.1 something 0.00 something2 0.004 something3 0.003...how could i add it? thank you very much in advance!"
