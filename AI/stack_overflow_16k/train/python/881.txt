"how to fix ""importerror: no module named request"" i'm trying to import requests for urllib2 and keep on getting an import error:...  importerror: no module named request...i'm trying to learn how to use urllib2 but just can't even get it started...from urllib.request import urlopen..html = urlopen(""http://www.google.com/"")..print(html)...i am not sure what the outcome of this is supposed to be, but hopefully i can get it working. it does autofill urllib2 in imports, so it's there."
