"how to make parallel calls to an application? i am trying to build a web-crawler on gae using flask and blank. i am no expert in building web-apps. ..so, i created a simple main page which has two buttons saying 'single' and 'list' which will take you to pages where you can enter a url and upload a csv file of urls respectively. ..now, the single url part is pretty straightforward but the list part is tricky. say, i upload a csv file of 'n' urls and i want each of them to call 'single' part (maybe n calls) and all the calls need to be parallel like multiprocessing/threading. ..how do i go about this? googling led me to task queues and i am reading about that. but i want to know which is the best way to go about this and any examples would be greatly appreciated...thanks in advance."
