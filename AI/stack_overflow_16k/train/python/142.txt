"how do i write the integers that in this file to the mynumbers.txt file? ok this function works perfectly, i just need to know how do i make it so it so the random integers that are generated, are written to the mynumbers.txt file.   ..def main():..#open a file for writing. outfile = open ('mynumbers.txt' , 'w')...#generate random integer number.from random import randint.number = randint(6, 12).print(""write will create"", number, ""random numbers"")..import random..i = 0.while i &lt; 11:.# get random number in range 10 through 20..n = random.randint(10, 20).print(n).i += 1.#write the numbers to the file..foo = """".while (i):.#find n.foo += str(n) + "" "".outfile.write(foo)..#call the main function.main()...is this right?"
