"how to access the values of a dictionary that is nested inside a dictionary i need to write a function that takes a dictionary with its keys equal to a name and the values are dictionaries. the dictionary that is nested inside has the key equal to a task and its value equal to the number of hours that task takes. i need to return a dictionary with the task as the key and its value a dictionary with the name as the key and its value the hours. ..i can't figure out how to access the values inside the nested dictionary so the values in the nested dictionary are just the same as the keys. .here is what i have:..def sprintlog(sprnt):.    new_dict = {}.    new_dict = {x: {y: y for y in sprnt.keys() if x in sprnt[y]} for l in sprnt.values() for x in l}.    return new_dict...if i pass in a dictionary such as:..d = {'ben': {'task1': 5}, 'alex': {'task1': 10, 'task2': 4}}...i'm expecting to get a dictionary such as:..new_dict = {'task1': {'ben': 5, 'alex': 10}, 'task2': {'alex': 4}}...but what i am getting at the moment is:..new_dict = {'task1': {'ben': 'ben', 'alex': 'alex'}, 'task2': {'alex': 'alex'}}"
