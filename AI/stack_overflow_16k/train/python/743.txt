"blank: how do you handle variables and modules of the same name? i'd like to use a module and store the result of calling one of it's methods into a variable with the same name as the module, but that would overwrite the module. how to best handle this?..example:..from something.deep.library import users.users = users.get_users()...obviously, it's not the best practice to overwrite the library with a variable. how can i best handle this? i've tried many things: some are ugly and some don't work...# doesn't work.from something.deep import library.users.users = library.users.get_users()..# ugly and inconsistent across the codebase.from something.deep.library import users as library_users.users = library_users.get_users()"
