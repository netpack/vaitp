"blank conditional makes variable becomes unsigned and raise `unboundlocalerror` so i was writing some conditionals when i started facing this issue. can someone please explain to me why this code fails to execute? (i simplified the semantics to make it simpler to reproduce)..a = 1.b = 2..def run():.  if a &lt; b:.    a = b..run()...it raises an unboundlocalerror: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment. it seems to happen to the variable being assigned inside the if block so i changed the function to this:..def run():.  if a &lt; b:.    b = a...and then the message was unboundlocalerror: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment...i am not sure if this is due to scoping but this code works normally:..def run():.  print(a).  print(b)...is there any think i missed from how blank works? if so, sorry for the dumb question but i have been working with blank for more than 4 years and never saw this before...tested in blank 2.7.15rc1 inside wsl and blank 3.6.4 in windows."
