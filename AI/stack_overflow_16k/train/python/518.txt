"finding first and last occurrence i am working on a practice problem about tracking and recording occurrences in a loop then return them when the loop is over. i have to loop through pixel colors of a simple image along y axis like this one:....this is my code:..for y in range(0, img.size[1]):.    x=0.    color = spimg.getpixel((x, y)).    print(color)...for this exercise i will always have the rgb values to the two different colors. i am looking for some elegant insights on storing information during a loop. the goal for me is to create a function that returns the y position of the top and bottom of the red section of the provided image...i did come up with solutions like adding colors to a list with a counter and use list[-1] to track changes or parse the list after the color detection loop is over...but all my solutions just seem very clunky and i think there is room for logic improvement. ..edit: just realized i only have partial solution like this..colorlist = [].for y in range(0, img.size[1]):.    x=0.    color = spimg.getpixel((x, y)).    colorlist.append(color).firstoccurrence = colorlist.index(redcolor)#only first occurrence"
