"find the same pattern in two files blank im trying to find a word that is in a file and search for that word in two different files .- to search that word in the first file and if the word is found the the line is printed in a new file .- to search for the same word in a second file and if the word is found to print the line found in the second file in the same output file after the line found in the first file and separated with a tabulation...this is the script that i wrote :..for line in first_file:.   for line2 in second_file:.      for word in keywords:.       if re.match (r""b""+word+r""b"" , line):.          result = (line.strip()+'t'+line2.strip()).          print (result, file = new_file)...but the result that i get is always an empty file...this is an example of the first file : .contig-39000000 1211    11.3902.contig-44000000 6128    17.8944.contig-91000000 2180    14.2197..this is an example of the second file .contig-316000330    out.18.contig-39000000 out.25........and this is an example of the search file ..contig-39000000.contig-289000379.contig-300000489.contig-310000168.contig-310000172.contig-320000463.contig-324000213.contig-327000055.contig-341000436.contig-342000384........the expected result would look like : ..contig-39000000 1211    11.3902   out.25...thank you"
