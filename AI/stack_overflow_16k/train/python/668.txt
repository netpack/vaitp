"is there anyway way to shorten this? very beginner programmer here in the process of learning. i am just wondering if this simple code i have typed is the most optimal way to do it...with open('guest_book.txt', 'a') as file_object:.    while true:.        name=input(""what is your name?"").        print(""welcome "" + name + "", have a nice day!"").        file_object.write(name + "" has visited! n"").        another = input(""do you need to add another name?(y/n)"").        if another == ""y"":.            continue.        elif another == ""n"":.            break.        else:.            print(""that was not a proper input!"").            while true:.                another = input(""do you need to add another name?(y/n)"").                if another == ""y"":.                    a = ""t"".                    break.                if another == ""n"":.                    a = ""f"".                    break.            if a == ""t"":.                continue.            else:.                break...my questions is in the  if statements. when i ask the input(""do you need to add another name?(y/n)"", is what i have typed the best way to re-ask the question if i get an answer other than y or n. basically i want the question to be repeated if i don't get either a yes or no answer, and the solution i found does not seem like the most optimal solution."
