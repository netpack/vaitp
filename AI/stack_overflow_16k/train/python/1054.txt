"blank: sentinel-controlled area computation using the coordinate method a neophyte here. i am trying to create a code that can compute the area of a simple polygon that is sentinel controlled: user inputs the coordinates of the corners, then the area will be computed once the user inputs ""stop"", given the he/she had given at least 3 coordinates; otherwise, an error message will appear prompting him to enter another pair of x-and y- coordinates until he gives at least 3 pairs...when i try to run the program, i always get this error message:.there is an error in your program: invalid syntax..then the variable v gets highlighted in red. ..btw, here's my code:..ans = """" .sigma2 = 0.0.corner_counter = 1..u1 = float(input(""nx-coordinate of the first corner: "")).v1 = float(input(""y-coordinate of the first corner: ""))..pu = u1.pv = v1..print ""number of points given: "",corner_counter # just to check the number corners given..while ans != ""stop"":..        ans = raw_input(""enter x-coordinate of the next corner or type 'stop' to compute the area: "")..        if ans == ""stop"":.                if corner_counter &gt;= 3:.                    break..                else:.                    u = float(input(""error: must enter at least three (3) corners to compute the area./nenter x-coordinate of the next corner: "").                    v = float(input(""enter y-coordinate: "")).                    sigma2 += ((pu * v) - (pv * u)).                    print ""(%d * %d) - (%d * %d) ="" %(pu, v, pv, u), (pu * v) - (pv * u).                    print ""partial sum:"", sigma2 # to check if the running sum agrees with the expected result.                    corner_counter += 1.                    continue.        else:.           u = float(ans).           v = float(input(""enter y-coordinate: ""))..                sigma2 += ((pu * v) - (pv * u))..                print ""(%d * %d) - (%d * %d) ="" %(pu, v, pv, u), (pu * v) - (pv * u).                print ""partial sum:"", sigma2 # to check if the running sum agrees with the expected result.                corner_counter += 1.                print ""number of points given: "", corner_counter # for checking purposes..        pu = u.        pv = v..print ""(%d * %d) - (%d * %d) ="" %(pu, v1, pv, u1), (pu * v1) - (pv * u1).sigma2 += (u * v1) - (v * u1).print ""ntotal sum:"", sigma2..# final output.print ""nthe area of the"", corner_counter,""-sided polygon is"", (abs(sigma2)/2), ""square unit(s).""  ...i had already tried to change it but nothing seem to work...hope you will help me guys. thanks a lot!"
