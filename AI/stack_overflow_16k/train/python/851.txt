"raise error if a blank dict comprehension overwrites a key is there a way to get a dict comprehension to raise an exception if it would override a key?..for example, i would like the following to error because there are two values for the key 'a':..&gt;&gt;&gt; {k:v for k, v in ('a1', 'a2', 'b3')}.{'a': '2', 'b': '3'}...i realise this can be done with a for loop. is there a way to do it while keeping the comprehension syntax?"
