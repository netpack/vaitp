"monthly compound interest calculation using blank # this program takes the original principal,.# calculates the annual interest rate .# calculates the number of times the interest is compounded.# calculates how many years the account will earn interest.# and lastly displays the ending principal...# input the original principal...original_principal = int(input( 'enter the starting principal: ' ))..# input the annual interest rate...annual_interest = float(input( 'enter the annual interest rate: ' ))..# input times per year the interest is compounded...compound = int(input( 'how many times per year is the interest compounded? ' ))..# input number of years account will earn interest...total_years = int(input( 'for how many years will the account earn interest? ' ))..# calculate ending principle amount after earning annual.# interest for a specified amount of years...ending_principal = original_principal * (1 + annual_interest / compound) ** .               (compound * annual_interest)..#display the ending principle amount...print ( 'at the end of 2 years you will have $' , .    format(ending_principal, ',.2f'))...i use $1,000 as my original_principal (just as an example) and should get a desired ending_principal of $ 1, 051.22...however i am nowhere near that number. .my guess is i'm missing a parenthesis somewhere in the calculation..i apologize in advance if i didn't format this code properly, this is my second time using stack overflow, still learning."
