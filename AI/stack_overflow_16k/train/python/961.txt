"blank zipapp with native extensions you can use zipapp to package apure  blank application into a zip file..you can also include pure blank library modules into that zip...the problem is that including libraries which contain native modules (.so in linux) does not work: blank is not able to load the .so from the zip file (because the os wants to load the native modules from a file) and blank is also not able to do load the .so from the file system (when the rest of the package is coming from the .zip file. ..is there a way to make blank load the .so files from the file system and the rest of the package from the .zip file?..(i know that pyinstaller/py2exe does similar things, but i want to control the boot loader)"
