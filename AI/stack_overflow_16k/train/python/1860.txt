"how to execute blank files separately as a blank script? what i want to do is have a blank script (that's a blank irc bot) that can run another blank script in the background/separately...i could do something like this:..#irc codey stuff here....if x == y:.    os.system('s%stuff.py') % path ...but this would stop main.py and it then runs stuff.py (in 1 command prompt) which i don't want to do..so what i am trying to make this script do is when the irc bot picks up a command via irc, i want it to run stuff.py separately, like double clicking on stuff.py and having main.py and stuff.py running at the same time...if there is a separate way of doing this in windows/linux, please, can you show both?"
