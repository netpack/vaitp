"without using pandas, how do i analyze csv data and only extract certain values from certain columns and rows of my csv file? i am writing a program that extracts the minimum and maximum mpg rating for cars. the car's information is stored in a csv file. i believe i wrote the correct min/max functions, however, i wrote it as if i was looping through all of the rows/columns. ..we are only supposed to include certain categories of cars for data extraction. the category of a car is the first column of csv data, which has an index of [0]. the mpg rating i am looping through is in column 10, which has an index of [9]...we are not supposed to include the categories ""van"", ""minivan"" or ""trucks"" in our min/max mpg calculation. is there a way to exclude based on these strings and loop through the remaining mpgs that are not excluded? ..lastly, once this is accomplished, i am supposed to write these results to a new file. is there any way i can open the file being written, to check if my code works? ..when i try to print the contents of the newly created file (based on user input), i get an error saying that file is not in the directory. any help would be appreciated...note: we are not allowed to import pandas. ..current code:..print(""welcome to epa mileage calculator"").yearchoice = int(input(""what year would you like to view data for? (2008 or 2009): "")).while yearchoice != 2008 and yearchoice != 2009:.    print(""invalid input, please try again"").    yearchoice = int(input(""what year would you like to view data for? (2008 or 2009): "")).saveresults = input(""enter the filename to to save results to: "")..if yearchoice == 2008:.    filein = open(""epavehicledata2008.csv"", ""r"").    filein.readline().    minmpg, maxmpg = [], [].    for line in filein:.        line = line.strip().        datalist = line.split("","").        minmpg.append(line[9]).    print(min(minmpg)).    print(max(maxmpg))..if yearchoice == 2009:.    filein = open(""epavehicledata2009.csv"", ""r"").    filein.readline().    minmpg, maxmpg = [], [].    for line in filein:.        line = line.strip().        datalist = line.split("","").        minmpg.append(line[9]).    print(min(minmpg)).    print(max(maxmpg))..filein = open(saveresults, ""r"").for line in filein:.    print(line)"
