"how to restrict user inputs? for example a program has the line:..user_input = raw_input("" enter : "")...how do you make it so that the program will only continue once what the user enters are letters only? and is he enter anything else he will get an error. ..edit: thanks for the help but it says try again if there is a space. the solution is:..while true:.    name = raw_input(""enter name : "").    if name.replace(' ', '').isalpha():.        break.    else:.        print ""try again"""
