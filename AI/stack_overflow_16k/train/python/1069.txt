"raising an array to different values i'm planning on plotting  y^n vs x for different values of n. here is my sample code:..import numpy as np..x=np.range(1,5).y=np.range(2,9,2)..exponent=np.linspace(1,8,50)..z=y**exponent...with this, i got the following error:..valueerror: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (4) (5) ...my idea is that for each value of n, i will get an array where that array contains the new values of y that is now raised to n. for instance:..y1= [] #an array where y**1.y2= [] #an array where y**1.5.y3= [] #an array where y**2...etc. i don't know if how i can get that 50 arrays for y**n and is there an easier way to do it? thank you."
