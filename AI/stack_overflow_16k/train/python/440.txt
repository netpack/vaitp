"how to create a simple ordered leaderboard for top 5 players in a text file for a one player game i'm making a 1 player quiz and need to implement a high score system that records the score of the top 5 highscorers and the player names appropriate to the scorer. this should be written to a text file (.txt) and overwritten if the score is higher (sorted from 1. highest score to 5. lowest score). if someone could share some code i could use for my highscore system that would be really helpful...the players that get through n rounds should be ordered from highest n score to lowest n score. it should have the top 5 n scores in a txt file, ordered...i've looked at loads of forums for hours and was unable to implement codes i found into my code. side note: i don't know how to do this at all..counter = 0.print(""the songs' initials are "" ,initialsofsong, "" and the name of the artist is "" ,randomartist).print (randomsong).songnameguess = input(""guess the name of the song!"").counter = counter + 1.while counter &lt; 3 and songnameguess != randomsong :.        songnameguess = input(""nope! try again!"").        counter = counter + 1.if songnameguess == randomsong:.    print (""well done!"").    if counter == 2:.        score = score + 1.    elif counter == 1:.        score = score + 3..elif counter &gt;=3 and songnameguess != randomsong:.    print (""sorry, you've had two chances. come back soon!"").    print (""game over."").    print (score)"
