"using try vs if in blank is there a rationale to decide which one of try or if constructs to use, when testing variable to have a value?  ..for example, there is a function that returns either a list or doesn't return a value. i want to check result before processing it. which of the following would be more preferable and why?..result = function();.if (result):.    for r in result:.        #process items...or..result = function();.try:.    for r in result:.        #process items.except typeerror:.    pass;...related discussion:..checking for member existence in blank"
