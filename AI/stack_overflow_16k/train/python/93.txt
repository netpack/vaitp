"concurrent requests limit in textrazor api i'm trying to use textrazor api with blank sdk for simple text requests...i currently have issues with the concurrent_request_used api...documentation says:..    concurrent_requests_used = proxy_response_json(""concurrentrequestsused"", 0, """""".    the number of requests currently being processed by your account..    """""")...but this simple piece of code:..import textrazor..textrazor.api_key = 'my_key'.print(textrazor.accountmanager().get_account().concurrent_requests_used)...prints: 2...expected response is: 0..in fact, the same documentation says this about calling the get_account() method in accountmanager class:..this call does not count towards your daily request or concurrency limits....i have no other processes or threads using the same key..am i missing something?"
