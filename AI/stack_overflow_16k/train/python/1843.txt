"blank plotting with for loop i am a newbie in blank and plotting stuff. i was trying to generate a plot using the following script. the goal was to draw a plot of q vs f for all values.  ..from pylab import *..n = 5.d = 13.b = 10..x = linspace(-6.5, 6.5, 1000).y = 1/sqrt(2*pi)*exp(-(x)**2/2)..for i in range(1,n):.    f = sum(y*cos(2*pi*i*x/d)*exp(-i**2*b/(4*d**2))).    print f..for j in range(1,n):.    q = 2*pi*(j)/d.    print q..plt.plot(q,f,'rx').plt.show()...when i am running the script, it plots only one data point instead of all. i am sure, i did some stupid mistake. someone could pls help me out here? thank you."
