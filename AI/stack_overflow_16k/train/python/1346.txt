"adding up count values of unique sequences in a txt file in 2 .txt files, i have 2 columns each having similar sequences with the second column in each file being count . part of the file,..    nnnncggttgnggtatgg      1.    nanntgtgaccatgaatg      1.    ngnntgagtcgtacgttt      1.    gtacactgtccaacgctg      1.    accctcccgcgtgcgctg      1.    tgnnnacagncanaaccc      8.    tgnnnacagncanaacca      3.    gnnngngggggcgngngt      1.    nnncgactaaacncgttg      1.    tgnnnacagncanaaccc      8...i want to add up the count values for each time the sequence occurs. .for example, “nnnncggttgnggtatgg” appears 3 times each with count 1 so the total read count for that sequence read would be 3. .i finally hope to retrieve read count for each sequence. (hope panda is not required for this)"
