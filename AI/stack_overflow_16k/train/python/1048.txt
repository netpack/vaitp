"turn string with operations into int? i am trying to create a short program to do a task. unfortunately i keep getting an error. the problem boils down to the following...if i try to run:..line = ""1+1"".int(line)...i would like it to return..2...however i get the following error:..invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1+1'...from looking online this is due to the fact that blank cannot recognize the fact that i have used a non-number. however without some rework i can't get around this...i was hoping that there is a straight forward method for solving this. i have tried using float but that has the same problem."
