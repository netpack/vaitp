"calculating the substrings of a string in blank i have a simple string ""abc"". now i have to write blank code for creating all possible unique substrings, except the empty string, from this string...the answer should be as follows:.a.b.c.ab.ac.bc.abc..i wrote something like this :..def getsubstrings(str):.    sub = [].    length = len(str).    for i in range(length):.        for j in range(i,length):.            sub.append(str[i:j+1]).    sub.sort().    return sub..str = ""abc"".print (getsubstrings(str))...but this is probably the wrong way , since it is not giving expected results...can someone please help me with an efficient solution...thanks in advance."
