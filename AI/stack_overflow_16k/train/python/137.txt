"babylonian algorithm function using while loop i am struggling on a babylonian algorithm to find a square root of 'a':...take a guess: pick some number x. .check how good is our guess, by computing abs(x2 - a). if it’s close enough (for example, less than 10^-6), we’re done. .otherwise, calculate an improved guess (x + a/x) / 2; this replaces the previous value of x and we repeat from the test....i have no idea where the while loop should come to, and what to do if the improved guess is still not correct...i have tried to every code under the 'while true' loop, but that made it even more confusing. this is the draft code below:..def babylonian(a,x):.    difference = abs(x ** 2 - a).    improved_guess = 0.5 * (a / x + x).    if difference &lt; 10 ** -6:.        print(""guess is right"").    while difference &gt; 10 ** -6:.        if (improved_guess ** 2 - a) &lt; 10 ** -6:.            break...if i enter (4, 1) for instance, the terminal does not give any value."
