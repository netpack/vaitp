"sorting score from text file into average i need to develop a program that sorts the scores from a quiz from a text file into averages into blank. the program uses previous data from the text file that includes the name of the person with a score attached. the code would have to open the file, read the data and then display it by the average score in blank. is there any help as i have no previous code."
