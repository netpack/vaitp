"how to live tail multiple files in blank i am new to blank and i am trying to write a program that live tails all files in a directory. i will be implementing regex expressions to catch patterns in new lines added and sending an email with the new line in it if a match is found. i looked and found some really good examples...i tried implementing exitstack for the handling of multiple files. see below:..def live_tail(thefile):..thefile.seek(0, os.seek_end)..while true:.    line = thefile.readline().    if not line:.        time.sleep(0.1).        yield str(line)..with exitstack() as stack:.    files = [stack.enter_context(open(file)) for file in l].    for file in files:.        loglines = live_tail(file).        for line in loglines:.            print(line)...the program runs but its stuck in an infinite loop that prints out empty lines. i tried searching for a solution but couldn't find anything... any help is greatly appreciated!"
