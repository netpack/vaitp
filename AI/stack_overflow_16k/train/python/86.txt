"blank (3.5) - open file, regex part of name, rename - loop i have a bunch of files: ..file completed for 123456 1 - platform junk (ap    .msg ..file completed for 1234566 1 - more junk here and stuf.msg..file completed for 654321 1 - Â® stuff and junk.msg..so each file contains a 6 or 7 digit number (not including that 1 after the number), also some files have stupid r (registered trademark) symbols. ..my goal is to search the current directory for all .msg files, find the 6 or 7 digit number, and rename the file to 123456.msg or 11234567.msg`...i have the regex that should work properly to extract the number: ..(?&lt;!d)(d{6}|d{7})(?!d)..now i just need to loop through all .msg files and rename them. i've got my foot in the door with the following code, but i don't quite know how to extract what i want and rename: ..for filename in glob.glob(script_dir + '*.msg'):.    new_name = re.sub(r'(?&lt;!d)(d{6}|d{7})(?!d)')...any help or step in the right direction would be much appreciated!"
