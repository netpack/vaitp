"checking number is prime in blank, why check up to int(sqrt(n)-1)) not int(sqrt(n)) new to blank here. i am trying to understand how this function works to check prime numbers:..from itertools import count, islice.from math import sqrt.def is_prime(n):.    if n &lt; 2: return false.    return all(n%i for i in islice(count(2), int(sqrt(n)-1)))...from what i understand you can check factors up to and including the square root of n, so why is this only testing up to sqrt(n)-1? i'm also not clear on the return all part for the function. n%i returns an int, the remainder. so why does this expression evaluate as a bool? any pointers on this would be great. thanks!"
