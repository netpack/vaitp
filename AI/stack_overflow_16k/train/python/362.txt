"match names in csv file to filename in folder i have got a list of about 7000 names in a csv file that is arranged by surname, name, date of birth etc.  i also have a folder of about 7000+ scanned documents (enrolment forms) which have the name of each person as a filename. ..now the filenames may not exactly match the names in the csv ie. john doe in the csv, filename will be john-michael doe etc....how would i go abouts writing a program that looks through the csv and see what filenames are missing in the scanned folder?..i am a complete novice in programming and any advice is appreciated."
