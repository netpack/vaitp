"why are my loops generating/returning the same values repeatedly? i am trying to make a sumo wrestler generator. i have described a class rikishi which has some attributes (only strings and ints)..class rikishi:..name = ''.weight = ''.skillroll = ''.skill = ''.rank = ''..name = generatename().*some loops to roll for numerical stats*...i also have a list that will hold all the rikishi objects..rikishilist = []...then i have a function to generate an instance of the class..def generaterikishi():.    rikishi = rikishi().    return rikishi...a function to display the attributes in the object:..def describerikishi(rikishi):.    print(rikishi.name).    print(rikishi.weight, 'kg').    print(rikishi.rank)...then i have a function to fill my array with the rikishi objects..def fillbanzuke():.    for x in range (0, 2):.        r = generaterikishi().        rikishilist.append(r)...and then finally a function to loop through the rikishilist and print a number (just to help visual clarity in testing) and then print the stats of the rikishi object in each element of the list..def describebanzuke():.    for x in range (0, len(rikishilist)):.        print(""#"",x+1).        describerikishi(rikishilist[x]).        print()...then i call the two functions..fillbanzuke().describebanzuke()...and then i print the size of the list just to ensure that my specified # of objects is being appended to the list..print('size of rikishi list:', len(rikishilist))...the result i'm getting is this..# 1.udagaje.234 kg.komusubi..# 2.udagaje.234 kg.komusubi..size of rikishi list: 2...can someone explain to me how i can avoid having the same information in each element of the list? i'm not sure if my problem is occurring when i am generating the rikishi object or if it is occurring when i am trying to print the contents of the list. any advice would be appreciated. only a few days into teaching myself blank from scratch...thank you in advance for your time and energy"
