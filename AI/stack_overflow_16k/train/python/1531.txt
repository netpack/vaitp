"pass object value as arguments to a function is there a way to pass a class as an argument to a function i've craeted?..for example:..if i have a class:..class a:.    def __init__(self,x,y,z):.        self._x = x.        self,_y = y.        self,_z = z...and some function:..def function(x,y,z):.    print(x,y,z)...is there a way to pass the object as arguments to the function?..tmp = a(1,2,3)..function(tmp)...edit:..i shall clerify my question:..in a case where i do not want to access the objects variables directly but by functions such as a.getx or a.gety...is it still possiable to pass the class to the cuntion and whiting the function preform the a.getx and a.gety functions?..def function(a):.    print(a.getx, a.gety)"
