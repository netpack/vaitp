"blank script not working after using pyinstaller to make it .exe path = os.path.realpath(__file__).try:.    shutil.move(path, ""c:\users\pc\appdata\roaming\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup"").except:.    pass  .try:.    if os.path.exists(""c:\users\pc\appdata\roaming\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup\{}"".format(os.path.basename(__file__))):.        os.remove(path).except:.    pass...this whole block of my code in blank doesn't work anymore after using pyinstaller, therefore doesn't move the file to the destination. keep in mind it worked just by running the blank script, so how do i adapt it to use pyinstaller to make it an .exe file (a working one)"
