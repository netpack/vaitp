"find occurrences of subsequences in event data with time constraints i have event data in the following format:  ..event     a a a a a c b c d a a a b.timestamp 0 3 4 4 5 5 6 7 7 8 8 9 10...given a list of sequences s and events e, how can i efficiently find the non-overlapping occurrences of s in e that are within a time window w, and each event in the occurrence is within an interval l from the previous event?  ..example results with s = {a, aa, aaa, aab, bb, ca}, w=3, l=2: ..occurrences:.a: [0, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8, 9].aa: [(3,4), (4,5), (8,8)].aaa: [(3,4,4), (8,8,9)].aab: [(4,5,6), (8,9,10)].bb: [].ca: [(7,8)]...as you can see, an occurrence doesn't have to be contiguous (i.e. all elements of the sequence appearing in a series). the timestamp is only illustrated as an integer."
