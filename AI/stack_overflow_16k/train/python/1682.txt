"blank input error nameerror on running script env (blank3) i have created a mini script to remember unknown words but i've a little problem, maybe it's easy to solve...the script works perfectly when i execute it with the ""blank script.py"" but when i try to execute it with the ""install"" script in / usr / local / bin changing the header with ""#!/usr/bin/env blank ""i get the following error:...  english word: word traceback (most recent call last):.  .  file ""/usr/local/bin/trans"", line 95, in ""module""..word = input(""english word: "")..  .  file ""string"", line 1, in ""module"".  .  nameerror: name 'word' is not defined...i use word = input ('english word:') to store the option...so, when i set the input like: ..englis word: example..i got the error, but when i enclosed in quotation marks like:..english word: 'example' ..it works perfect, but why? what's the explanation? and a solution to avoid to add "" ' ' ""?..just in case i use ubuntu...beforehand thanks for reading!"
