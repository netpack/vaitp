"blank: trying to execute command to clear screen if user inputs certain number i'm trying to remake a terminal from the fallout series, if any of you know what that is...basically, the program shows a bunch of options they can choose from, then they have to input a number (1-5) to select which thing they want to view. the program will use an if statement to determine which thing they want to view. for example, if the user inputted one, then it will clear the screen and print a bunch of information, then the user has to input enter, then the screen clears and the options from the beginning are displayed again. this whole thing is inside a while statement, and while the user input is not ""c"", it will still display all of that other stuff, and when it does become ""c"", the program will clear everything and the program ends...i know all of that sounded confusing, but basically the problem is that if the person inputs a number, it doesn't do the clearing thing, it just displays the choices again...i'll just display the code, so if anyone could tell me what the problem is, that would greatly be appreciated...def confusingfunction():.    from os import system.    userchoice = """"..    while userchoice.upper() != ""c"":.        print(""choice 1"").        print(""choice 2"").        print(""choice 3"").        print(""choice 4"").        print(""choice 5"").        userchoice = input(""&gt;&gt;&gt;"")..        if userchoice == 1:.            system('cls').            print(""stuff"").            print(""stuff"").            print(""stuff"").            input(""&gt;&gt;&gt;"").            system('cls')..    system('cls').    return"
