"smart syntax for this issue i have list of lists. let say somethink like that:..somelist = [ .               [1, 2, 3],.               [4, 8, 2],.               [7, 8, 4, 8, 2],.           ]...here my list contains 3 lists. with list which have len(list) == 3 i want to do something like this:..list1 = somelist[0].list2 = somelist[1].list3 = somelist[2]..for l1 in list1:.    for l2 in list2:.        for l3 in list3:.            function(something=[l1, l2, l3])...but my list can have 2 &lt;= len(somelist) &lt;= 10. so if my list have len(somelist) == 4 i have to do:..list1 = somelist[0].list2 = somelist[1].list3 = somelist[2].list4 = somelist[3]..for l1 in list1:.    for l2 in list2:.        for l3 in list3:.            for l4 in list4:.                function(something=[l1, l2, l3, l4])...so my question is how to write nice code which will work with different len(somelist)?"
