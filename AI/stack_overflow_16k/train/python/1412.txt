"merge two blank list of tuples i have two lists of tuples. each tuple contains a datetime object and a float object i.e.:..l1 = [(dt1), 1.0), (dt2, 2.0), (dt3, 3.0)].l2 = [(dt1), 1.0), (dt3, 3.0), (dt5, 6.0)]...the two lists are already sorted by the datetime of each tuple...what would be a fast way to merge the two lists ?..the two lists may not contain the same datetimes..if one dt exists in one list but not the other the missing value can be ''..so for example using the two lists above i would like to produce..l = [(dt1), 1.0, 1.0), (dt2, 2.0, ''), (dt3, 3.0, 3.0), (dt5, '', 6.0)]...i'm guessing maybe i should use a dictionary with the dt as key and then resort but that .seems wasteful...any other ideas ?..thanks"
