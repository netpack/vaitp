"using a while loop to compute the sum of integers from two numbers i'm having some trouble with a homework problem on mypytutor which is asking me to write a function sum_from_to(start, end) that uses a while loop to compute the sum of the integers from start up to, but not including end. ..the given code is:..def sum_from_to(start, end):.""""""return the sum of the integers from start up to but not including end...sum_from_to(int, int) -&gt; int."""""".# add your code here: use a while loop...examples:...sum_from_to(3, 7) should evaluate to 18 (i.e. 3+4+5+6)..sum_from_to(3, 3) should evaluate to 0....how would i approach this? i've seen this same question from half a year ago but it was never resolved. any help would be greatly appreciated as i'm really stuck on this!"
