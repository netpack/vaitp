"how to loop through multiple lines in a blank string and convert to integers: i am attempting to cycle through the following code:..data = ""456432 jfhjsdfjs fhdjsjk 990 fdjsf"".345903 fdsfdfs fsfdsfd 667 fsdfd.456432 sfdsfds fdsfdsfd 778 fdsfds""..i want to convert the numbers of the first series of numbers of each line so it returns the following (converted to integers)..here is the code i have so far, which sorts everything: ..print [int(data.split()[0])]..i am guessing i will have to loop through each line while still pulling the 0 item of the list of each line. though not sure i am on the best workflow for this."
