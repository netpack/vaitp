"overwrite flags in a file blank i have a file in the following format:..[character1]    .health = 100    .lives = 3        .some other flags..[character2]    .health = 50    .lives = 1    .etc..[character3]    .missing lives line    .some other flags...i have information on the updated lives in such a format:.lives[char][status] where for character1 it would look like lives['character1']['lives = 3']..so what i am trying to do is go through the file and updating the lives based on the information above, and add missing lives flags such as character3..with open('characters.txt', 'rw') as chars:.    for line in chars:.        if line.find('[') is not none:.            character = line.        if line.find('lives =') is not none:.            if line != lives[character][status].                line = line.replace(lives[character][status]).            chars.write(line)...that's my general logic behind it but it looks like character is being set to the line following it instead (health = 100)..any help would be greatly appreciated!"
