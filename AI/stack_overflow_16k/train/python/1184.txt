"blank trying to write string to file then read string and eval, but something went wrong i am trying to write a very simple script that would simulate a pocket secretary for my homework,  but i have a small issue..i want all my data to be saved in a file (abstract form) each time i exit the program and then when i boot it up i want to read that file, eval(stack) (basically load the data into memory) then verify if it's valid ... anything that isn't is deleted..this is what i've done:..    def loadtostring (stack):.        f = open (""data.txt"", ""w"").        load_stack = str(stack)  #convert to string.        f.write (load_stack)  #write in file.        f.close() ..    def loadfromstring ():.       f = open (""data.txt"", ""r"").       load_stack = f.readline() #read string.       if (load_stack == """" or load_stack == "" "" or load_stack == none): .           stack = [].           return stack .      else:.          stack = eval(load_stack) #trying to convert from string to list.      f.close ()...my problem is when i look into the file ... it's not really a string because it lacks the apostrophes &lt;""> thus when i try to ""eval (stack)"" something goes wrong and my ""memory"" ends up being empty (when i try to print the stack it's empty -none-)..i cannot for the life of me understand why this is happening. also i'm ok with a quick fix (artificially adding apostrophes in the .txt file)..i have no idea how to check if a file is empty or if i read an empty line so i'd also appreciate if you could help me with the ""if"" statement in ""loadfromstring""..about eval () ... like i said this is just homework so i'm not afraid about any malicious intents."
