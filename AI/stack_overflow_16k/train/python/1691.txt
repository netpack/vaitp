"blank - writing to a specific point in a line i have encountered an error when writing my program and would like some help with it.  the program has to replace a specific segment of the line with a calculated value. the segment in which i am talking about is the third index in a line, formatted like this:..product01, 12346554, 15, 6...i am having the program calculate the value in which i want to replace with the final value but no matter how much i seem to try, my code frequently gives errors. for an example, i have used seek to try and move the cursor to allow myself to edit this value, however with the following code:..total = 0.receipt = open(""receipt.txt"", ""w"").while true:.    try:.        prod_code = input(""enter a code or done to get your final receipt: "").        if len(prod_code) == 8:.            int(prod_code).            with open(""data base.txt"", ""r+"") as searchfile:.                for line in searchfile:.                    if prod_code in line:.                        print(line).                        quantity = input(""what quantity of this product do you want? "").                        total += float(line.split("","")[2]) * int(quantity).                        print(quantity).                        print(total).                        receipt.write(line).                        print(line.split("","")[3]).                        w = int(line.split("","")[3]) - int(quantity).                        print(w).                        l = (line).                        l.seek(27, 0).                        l.write(str(w))..        elif prod_code == ""done"":.            receipt.close().            with open(""receipt.txt"", ""r"") as datafile:.                for item in datafile:.                    print(item.split("","")[1]).                    print(item.split("","")[2])..            print(""your total cost is Â£"", total)    .            input(""press enter to exit:"").            exit().    else:.        print(""incorrect length, try again"").except valueerror: .    print(""you must enter an integer"")...however, when i run it this is the error that i get:..attributeerror: 'str' object has no attribute 'seek'....i was wondering if anyone could help, and/or provide a different answer to my problem? thanks in advance."
