"blank: choosing indices from array that correspond to elements of specific value i have an array that looks like this:..x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]...i want to write a function that will randomly return some specified number of indices that correspond to a specified number. in other words, if i pass the function the array x, the desired number of indices such as 3, and the target value 1, i would want it to return an array such as:..[0, 7, 13]..since 0, 7, and 13 are the indices that correspond to 1 in x...does anyone know how i might do this efficiently?"
