"how to configure syslog for logging in blank i have started to use logging module in blank. my blank code properly logs via several handlers but in my code i still use also syslog module. when i tried to replace it and add just another handler to logging, i found out that output differs...logging.handlers.sysloghandler(address = ""/dev/log"").....logging.error(""foo"")..syslog.syslog(syslog.log_err, ""foo"")...the output is:..apr 14 16:42:33 hroch journal: foo..apr  2 10:11:51 hroch myscript: unable to connect/login to fencing device...attempt to use logging.formatter did not bring any success as only part after colon is changed."
