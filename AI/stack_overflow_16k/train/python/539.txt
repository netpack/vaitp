"select unique combination of entities from different lists using keys apologies if this question has been asked, i may not have the necessary vocabulary to find the correct question...if i have some equal-length lists (or tuples) of things like this:..[6, 4, 7] [gold, blue, red] [dog, cat, echidna] [hot, cold, rainy]...and a set of keys that are consecutive integers in a known range that is equal to the number of unique combinations (in this case 81)...is is possible to select one item from each list for each key, such that the combination is guaranteed to be unique? (and also get the key from the combination)...so that ..0 might yield (6, gold, cat, hot)..1 might yield (cat, 4, gold, rainy)..2 might yield (hot, red, echidna, 7)..etc.....and know that (hot, red, echidna, 7) is the selection produced by 2?..assuming the length and order of the lists is known and fixed, the items in the lists are guaranteed to be unique within each list and across all lists, and each list can be ordered/sorted"
