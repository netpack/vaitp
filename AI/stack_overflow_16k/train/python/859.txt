"for loop skipping over certain folders i am trying to loop through sub folders in a directory, but my for loop is skipping over some folders for a reason that is not clear to me, despite having the same name structure and properties as the other folders in the directory. i should add that the directory is a mapped network drive, but i'm not sure why that would matter. i've tried both os.walk and listdir to pick up the names of the folders:..root = r""mydir""..for directory, subdirectory, files in os.walk(mydir):.    print(directory)...def get_immediate_subdirectories(a_dir):.    return [name for name in os.listdir(a_dir).        if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(a_dir, name))]...is there a way to force the code to pick up everything in my main directory other than what i'm doing here?..expected output:..['11111-apples',. '11112-bananas',. '11113-grapes',. '11114-oranges',. '11115-pears']..actual output:..['11112-bananas',.'11113-grapes',.'11115-pears']"
