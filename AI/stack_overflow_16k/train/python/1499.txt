"instantiate object after a string blank? i have read many questions about this problem (like this one), suppose i have a string 'foo' and i want to instantiate an object named foo of a particular type..what i would like to do is to be able to dynamically build an object adding properties extracted from an xml file (using the bunch pattern)...the problem i have is to name the ""root"" object(the bunch or the container) according to a particular string...edit.i've realized that i could do something like ..exec('%s = bunch' % 'foo')...my bad"
