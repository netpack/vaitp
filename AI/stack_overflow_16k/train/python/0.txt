"is it legal to define two methods with the same name but different returning types? i've written a piece of code to determine a typical palindrome string. i did this by the definition of a reverse() method returning a string. i also eager to have the same method, but in the void form, because of some future needs..as i add the latter to the code, the valid output will become invalid..so, the question is that is it legal to define two methods with the same name but different returning types?.if not, please let me know how to write this code with the void-type method...class detector(object):.    def __init__(self,string):.        self.string = string..    forbidden = (' ','!','?','.','-','_','&amp;','%',""#"","","")..    def eliminator(self):.        for item in self.forbidden:.            if item in self.string:.                self.string = self.string.replace(item,"""")..    def reverse(self):.        return self.string[::-1]            ..    #def reverse(self):.    #    self.string = self.string[::-1]    i am prone to add this method..    def check(self):.        reversed = self.reverse().        if self.string == reversed:.            print(""yes"").        else:.            print(""no"")..det = detector(""rise to vote, sir!"").det.eliminator().det.check()...when i add the commented lines, the valid ""yes"" becomes ""no""!"
