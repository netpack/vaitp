"how do i loop my password/username login page and read the password/username from an external file? i'm aware of the multiple posts and sources regarding how to loop and read from a text file. i'm sorry to be that guy but i'm a recent noob at blank and i'm writing this at 1:00 in the morning. ..as the title suggests, how do i loop my login page so that if the user enters details incorrectly then they get another chance to try, until they have entered details correctly. the password/username also needs to be read from an external file...my code:..print (""nenter details to access wallet...n"").username = 'janupedia'.password = '12345'.userinput = input(""what is your username?n"").if userinput == username:.    userinput = input(""password?n"")   .    if userinput == password:.       print(""welcome!"").       print('n--------------------------------------------------------n').       print (""btn = 0.10"").       print (""= Â£315.37"").    else:.       print(""that is the wrong password."").else:.    print(""that is the wrong username."").print('n--------------------------------------------------------n')"
