"create visuals in blank? me and my friend are making a small, very text-based adventure/fantasy game. the combat is the turn-taking style you see in games like pokemon or final fantasy, but it's played as a linear visual novel with multiple paths. right now we're just working on a combat algorithm and other basics, but when we actually get to designing the world i'm not sure if there's a way to create visuals with blank or if i have to couple it with another code that works with blank in order to do this. if so, how do i ""couple"", or whatever the term is, this code with the blank code?"
