"differnce between binary_add and inplace_add i was going through the dis package of blank. i tried code to see how it is working ..&gt;&gt;&gt; def get():....     x=4....     y=x+3 ............ this line....     z=8....     return y...and then run dis.dis(get) which prints the byte-code instruction for above code...for x+3 byte-code instruction is binary_add and when went trough package docs, i found another term inplace_add..although in there they have mentioned what is inplace_add but i did not get the difference...i have two question ..a). what is difference between binary_add and inplace_add..b). how can i write code so that byte-code instruction shows inplace_add"
