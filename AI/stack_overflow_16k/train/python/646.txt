"is there a universal selector option for if...in clauses? i have a ""large"" list of tuples:..thelist=[(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)]...i want to check whether any tuple in the list starts with a 1, and if it does, print ""aaa"":..for i in thelist:.    templist.append((i[0],i)).for i in templist:.    if i[0]==1:.        print(""aaa"").        break...which is rather ardurous as i have to create the templist. is there any way i can do this:..if (1,_) in thelist:.    print(""aaa"")...where _ is the universal selector. note that the list would be very large and thus it is very costly to implement another list."
