"i don't understand the syntax to this for loop in blank at the moment i'm learning blank from blank crash course. i understand that for a for loop has a general format like so:..for [iterating variable] in [sequence]:.        [do something]...but as i'm reading the textbook i see this new format in the front of the for loop and i was looking up solutions but i didn't know what this might be called. ..for key, value in user_0.items():...i assumed the for loop is designating itself specifically to the dictionary key and that is why there was the word ""key"" in front of the for loop? here's a screenshot for a frame of reference if needed."
