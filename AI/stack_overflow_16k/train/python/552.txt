"pass large data structure in blank in c++, it's good practice to pass references to large data structures to avoid the overhead of copying the whole thing by value. blank works very differently, though, and i'm wondering how best to pass a large data structure...here's the simple version. is this what i should use, or is there something better?..foo(hugearray):.    # change values in hugearray.    return hugearray..hugearray = foo(hugearray)...solution (kudos to jonrsharpe!)..foo(hugearray).    hugearray[0] = ""new!""..myarray[0] = ""old."".foo(myarray).print myarray[0] # prints ""new!""...the function changes the original array, so there's no need to assign the return value to the original to change it."
