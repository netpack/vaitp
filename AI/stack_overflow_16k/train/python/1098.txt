"blank overwrite file containing current date and time i am new to blank. i need to create a door.lock file that contains the current date and time. also, i need to overwrite this file every x minutes with a new file containing the current date and time. i'm using this as a pseudo lock file to allow me to test on run of the software whether or not the software crashed and how long ago it crashed. my issue is i can't seem to overwrite the file. i've only failed at creating and/or appending the file. i created the following as a test:..    from datetime import datetime, timedelta..    ending = false..    lock_filename = ""door.lock""  # the lock file.    lock_file_update = true.    mins_lock_file_update = 1  # the (x) time in minutes to write to lock file.    next_lock_file_update = datetime.now()..    lock_file = open(lock_filename, ""w"").    now = datetime.now().    now_string1 = str(now.strftime(""%y-%m-%d_%a_%h:%m"")).    lock_file.write(now_string1).    print ""first now string"".    print now_string1..    # ==============================================================================.    #main loop:.    while ending is false:..    # ==============================================================================.      # check if it is time to do a lock file time update.      now = datetime.now().      now_string1 = str(now.strftime(""%y-%m-%d_%a_%h:%m"")).      if lock_file_update:  # if lock_file_update is set to true in dm settings.        if next_lock_file_update &lt;= datetime.now():.            lock_file.write(now_string1).            print now_string1.            next_lock_file_update = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=mins_lock_file_update)...will someone pinpoint my error(s) for me? tia ..when i cat the above file, door.lock, it is empty."
