"default key for blank builtin max/min functions the documentation for the built-in functions max and min in blank indicate that the key parameter should operate like it does in the sort function. in other words, i should be able to do this:..a = [1, 2, 3, 4].max(a, key=none)...however, this raises an error:.typeerror: 'nonetype' object is not callable..but, if i do something similar with the sort function, i get the expected results:..a = [1, 2, 3, 4].a.sort(key=none)...no error is generated and the default sort is used. several books also imply that i should be able to get away with the same behavior in the max and min functions. see this excerpt from blank in a nutshell...is this really the default behavior of the max and min functions? should it be? shouldn't they match the sort function?"
