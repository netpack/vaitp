"check for the last space in a string? i have a string that goes ""quisque pretium magna ac aliquet interdum. mauris posuere, risus non mollis placerat, diam ligula commodo justo, ac aliquet velit ante a ipsum."" stored in a variable t and i have a variable l which is set to 30...i am trying to write a loop that will print the string out, but in such a way that only l amount of characters (30 in this case) can fit on the line. if there is a word which goes over the limit (as in, it starts on character 28 and ends on 32), then i am trying to store the index at which point the last space was (the index of the most recent "" "") in a variable called s. this is what i have, but i'm not sure where to go from here:..finalstr = """".reg = re.compile('[a-z]').for i in range(0, l):.    if t[i] &gt;= l and reg.search(t[i]):.        finalstr += ""n"".    else:.        finalstr += t[i]..return finalstr...what i want to get is:..quisque pretium magna ac.aliquet interdum. mauris.prosuere, risus non.mollis placerat, diam.ligula commodo justo, ac.aliquet velit ante a .ipsum....however, this is the traceback i get, what am i doing wrong?..traceback (most recent call last):.file ""problem.py"", line 146, in &lt;module&gt;.print wrap(t, l).file ""problem.py"", line 122, in wrap.if t[i] &gt;= l and reg.search(t[i]):.indexerror: list index out of range"
