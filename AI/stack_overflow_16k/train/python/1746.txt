"argparse infer variable type from command line format i have a simple blank script that takes input from the command line and subsequently modifies a namelist file. i use it like this:..blank edit_namelist.py nml section key value...the problem is that the value can either be integer, float or string. currently, i used the following:..def infer(s):.    ''' try to parse input to integer. if it fails, keep it as string '''.    try:.        s = int(s).    except valueerror:.        pass.    return s..parser.add_argument(""value"",type=infer)...this works, but only as long as my input is either integer or string. i wonder whether it is possible to have argparse infer the variable type from the format of the command line input, such that..blank edit_namelist.py nml section key 10.blank edit_namelist.py nml section key 10..blank edit_namelist.py nml section key ""10""...are interpreted as integer, float, and string, respectively."
