"why does blank treat variables as integers, and not allow decimals? in some simple mathematics, here i am trying to get the percentage of targets which have been done from the total number.  the ones which have been done are positive.  in my understanding, the following mathematics should give me a percentage of 50, but running it, blank insists on giving me zero.  why would that be?..total =  2.positives = 1.percentage = (positives/total)*100.print ('percentage is: ' + str(stat) + '%n' )..&gt;&gt;&gt;percentage is: 0%"
