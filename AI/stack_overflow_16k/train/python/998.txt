pandas: how to merge columns containing the same name within a single data frame? i have a dataframe extracted from an excel file which i have manipulated to be in the following form (there are mutliple rows but this is reduced to make my question as clear as possible):..        |a|b|c|a|b|c|.index 0: 1 2 3 4 5 6...as you can see there are repetitions of the column names. i would like to merge this dataframe to look like the following:..        |a|b|c|.index 0: 1 2 3 .index 1: 4 5 6...i have tried to use the melt function but have not had any success thus far.
