"how can i access variable in function (blank)? i've got two variables: 'mood' and 'counter' and none of them can be changed inside my function ""click"". it says:"" unboundlocalerror: local variable 'mood' referenced before assignment ""..i've already tried to globalize these variables outside the function, but it wasn't working. so then i've tried to get these variables into other two via returning them, but i don't know how to use code in the mainloop() function..  mood = 20..  counter = 1..  def click():.     if mood&gt;=20:  # here is where error is being thrown..        mood= mood - 1.     elif mood==20: # here is where error is being thrown..        mood= mood + 1 ..  click()...i expect 'counter' and 'mood' to be changed in the function because i don't know how to do other code in the tkinter's mainloop."
