"running a script with arguments from within another blank script in jupyter, this can be achieved with the %run line magic. like this:..%run -i somescript.py -f -b...but that magic does not work from within a blank script file. i tried this:..os.system(""blank3 -i somescript.py -f -b"")...a further complication is that i want to use a variable, like this:..%run -i somescript.py -f $line -b"
