"rewrite simple blank code efficiently i have the following code, which is likely to be repeated. meaning, i will need to search the entire log file during different parts of the code to see if two particular patterns exist in it. i cant always search for the patterns at once, at the start of the code.  ..but basically, below is what i have and i'm looking for ways to optimize it. assuming the logfile being read can be very huge in size.  ..    textfile = open(logfile, 'r').    filetext = textfile.read().    textfile.close().    matchesbegin = re.search(beginsearchdvar, filetext).    matchesend = re.search(endinsearchdvar, filetext).    if matchesbegin is not none and matchesend is not none:.        lrangea = seeifexactrangeisfound().        patterncount = len(lrangea).        lrange = 'n'.join(lrangea)...i know this can be optimized with the with option but i dont know how to go about doing that."
