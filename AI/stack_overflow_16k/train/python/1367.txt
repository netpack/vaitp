"raspberry pi blank script in sl state i got a blank script to collect data from a few connected sensors. this script runs in background from starting the pi. the script is working fine but irregular it fells in 'sl' state. if i restart the pi it works again for a few days, but then it happens again. ..is there a way to monitor the state of the script (kill it and start it again if this happens) or any idea why this happen?"
