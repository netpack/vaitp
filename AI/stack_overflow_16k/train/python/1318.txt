"unboundlocalerror: local variable 'actionnumber' referenced before assignment and array i'm really sorry if this question has been asked before, but i can't seem to find the solution to this error anywhere for my case...i have a text file with screen coordinates (x and y, separated by a new line), and i want to read the file, and store every line of the file onto an two separate arrays - one for x, and one for y...i then want to use pyautogui.moveto() to move to the two x and y coordinates, then click (i haven't done any of that yet)...the variable actionnumber simply acts like i in a for loop, to count which line we're on in the text file...how can i create the two arrays (datax[] and datay[]) in blank that can be read through mainloop(), and then store a line of data from the file in datax[actionnumber] and then the next line of the file into datay[actionnumber]?..here is my code, it is pretty simple:..actionnumber = 0..datax = [].datay = []..f = open(""track_cursor_position_log.txt"", ""r"").#print(f.read())...def mainloop():.    #i need to store the first line of the file into datax, then the second into datay, then the 3rd into datax, and so on.....    actionnumber = actionnumber + 1..    mainloop()..mainloop()...here are the errors i get:..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""c:/users/devel/downloads/blank-imagesearch-master/blank-imagesearch-master/clickagenttest.py"", line 17, in &lt;module&gt;.    mainloop().  file ""c:/users/devel/downloads/blank-imagesearch-master/blank-imagesearch-master/clickagenttest.py"", line 13, in mainloop.    actionnumber = actionnumber + 1.unboundlocalerror: local variable 'actionnumber' referenced before assignment...here is a small snippet of the data in the file track_cursor_position_log.txt, just so you can get what i'm talking about:..1858.1129.1292.1165.927.1287.1501.461.1567.709.2298.1049.1473.1244.2511.1722...i once more apologise if this is a noob question, but i am more of a c++/js coder, and i haven't used blank in a while.....thank you very much to everyone who can help out!"
