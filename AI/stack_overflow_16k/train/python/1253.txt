"canonical way to build a plug-in system in blank i'll try to keep this question objective. what is the canonical way to build a plugin-system for a blank desktop application?..is it possible to have an easy to use (for the developer) system which achieves the following:...users input their code using an in-app editor (the editor could end up dumping their plugins into a subdirectory of the app, if necessary).keep the source of the application ""closed"" (yes, there are pitfalls to obfuscation)...thanks"
