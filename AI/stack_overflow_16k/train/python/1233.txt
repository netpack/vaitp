"how do you convert a fileinput.input into integer in blank? i'm trying to solve day 1 of 30 days of code by hackerrank and tried converting the fileinput.input into integer...i tried converting it into integer using int() and converting it to a string using str() then integer using int(). both methods don't seem to work...i = 4.d = 4.0.s = 'hackerrank '.# declare second integer, double, and string variables...# read and save an integer, double, and string to your variables...# print the sum of both integer variables on a new line...# print the sum of the double variables on a new line...# concatenate and print the string variables on a new line.# the 's' variable above should be printed first..import fileinput.i2 = fileinput.input().d2 = fileinput.input().s2 = str(fileinput.input())..i3 = i + i2.d3 = d2 * 2..print(str(i3)).print(str(d3)).print(str(s+s2))...i expected it to be:..16.8.0.hackerrank is the best place to learn and practice coding!...but it returned:.. traceback (most recent call last):.      file ""solution.py"", line 20, in &lt;module&gt;.        i3 = i + i2.    typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'fileinput'"
