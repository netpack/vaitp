"put permissions/access rights to some individual i'm trying to make a web app scheduler using flask/blank but i hit a wall right away. i have plans on how to build the app but i just don't have the slightest idea on how to apply it. ..so basically what i have in mind is that, one employee with some access or permission to a specific job (eg. frontend, backend, warehouse). say this #1 employee can do front and back end but not warehouse then #2 employee can only do warehouse only. ..i've tried using @classmethod but i don't think that's the right approach...https://gist.github.com/decenttaro/6b3d80b96d56f1285565af41e6c7014c"
