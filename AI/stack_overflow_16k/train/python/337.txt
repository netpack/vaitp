"blank: import a script in idle this has probably been asked before, and is really basic, but:..i'm using windows 7. i have idle for blank 2.4.4 and 3.1. i have some scripts residing in arbitrary locations on my file system. i'd like to import them and play around with their types. how can i do so?..in ubuntu, on the command line, import scriptname works if the directory i called blank from contains scriptname. how would i import a script from somewhere else?"
