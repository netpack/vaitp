"how can i model a tilting mirror in pyzdde? i am trying to model spherical aberrations as a function of the tilt angle of a mirror in an optical system. i am using optics studio for the model and pyzdde to communicate with it. i thought this would be easy; i would setup a list of tilt angles and then loop over them changing the relevant surface parameters and calling zgetzernike(): ..for i in range(len(angle)):.    ln.zsetsurfaceparameter(n, 54, angle[i]).    ln.zsetsurfaceparameter(n, 64, -angle[i]).    ln.zgetzernike().    print(zern[1])...however, this didn't work. ..i am getting the same zernike coefficients independent of angle. i tried calling ln.zpushlens(1) and ln.zgetupdate() but neither one worked. it looks like the changes are not getting updated on the server side..i also tried introducing coordinate breaks before and after the mirror surface and changing the angles for those surfaces but that didn't work either. ..what am i missing and what can be done to make this work ? ..i would also like to change the wavelength, but that doesn't seem to work either. i call ln.zsetprimarywave(n), where n is a wave number, but the server always uses the first wavelength from the settings in optics studio. ..is there a way to change the wavelength with which the zernike coefficients are calculated ?"
