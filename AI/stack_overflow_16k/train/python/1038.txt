"blank - printing duplicates after getting previous and next element in a list sorry for the beginner question -- in running this code, it prints the output twice rather than printing once and then continuing on to the next iteration of the loop. i'm sure this is simply a formatting error, but i can't seem to spot it... thanks!..mylist = [1, 1, 1, 0.5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0.5, 1, 3]..for thisthing in mylist: .    baseindex = mylist.index(thisthing)..    if thisthing == 0.5:.        get_previous = mylist[baseindex - 1].        get_next = mylist[baseindex + 1]..        t2 = thisthing * 2.        if t2 == get_previous and t2 == get_next:.            print(""success at index "" + str(mylist.index(thisthing))).            continue..output:.success at index 3.success at index 3"
