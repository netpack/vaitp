"blank: how to create a new file and write contents of variable to it? i am writing a program that outputs the file types inside a directory by looking at their headers...some of the files are compressed so i need to be able to decompress them as a starting point..so far i have been able to search directories and using the header  change the extensions, and open the compressed file and store its contents in a variable, now i am having trouble saving the variable as a new file...def unzip():.    os.chdir(""c:/users/david/myfiles"").    files = os.listdir(""."").    for x in (files):.        f = open((x), ""rb"").        byte1 = f.read(1).        byte2 = f.read(1).        if byte1 == b'x1f' and byte2 == b'x8b':.            os.rename((x), (x) + "".gz"").            file = gzip.open((x), ""rb"").            content = file.read()   .            print (content)...i'm guessing i will have to use the a command along the lines of f.write(""newfile"", content) but not sure...thanks in advance"
