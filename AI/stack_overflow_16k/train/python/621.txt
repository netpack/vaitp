"simple blank code not working but not throwing an error in the editor i started learning blank from codeacademy, and i realized right away that the course was outdated. i continued the course with visualstudio open in case i wanted to make sure something didn't change. however, i tried making a very simple program that outputs the date in visualstudio and it's not doing anything. ..from datetime import datetime.now = datetime.now.print(now.second)...when i run this in the visualstudio environment, it throws the error:..attributeerror: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'second'...when only seconds ago i had done it in codeacademy. i have done my fair share of googling and found nobody who has come across the same issue."
