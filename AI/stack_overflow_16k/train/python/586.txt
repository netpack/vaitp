"passing a list of values to a function sorry for such a silly question, but sitting in front of the comp for many hours makes my head overheated, in other words â€” i'm totally confused. .my task is to define a function that takes a list of words and returns something..how can i define a function that will take a list of words? ..def function(list_of_words):.    do something...when running this script in blank idle we should suppose to write something like this:..&gt;&gt;&gt; def function('this', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'of', 'words')...but blank errors that the function takes one argument, and six (arguments) are given..i guess i should give my list a variable name, i.e. list_of_words = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'of', 'words'], but ... how?"
