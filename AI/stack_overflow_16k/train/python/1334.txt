"writing column entry just one below another in blank i have imported a file containing 8 columns, each column separated by 't', so during import all 't' are replaced by 'space' and 'n' are split to make indexing easier for me. then a list is generated form input file for further analysis. but after analysis i got..lst =  ['pair', '1mfk', 'uranium', '82', 'helium', '112', 3.6997']...kind of list, so i put  ..final = '    '.join(lst)   ...to get the values like pair 1mfk 1 uranium 82 helium 112 3.6997.but when i print all values it comes as following..pair 1mfk 1 uranium 82 helium 112 3.6997  .pair 2jgh 2 plutonium 98 potassium 88 5.3003  .pair 345g 3 sodium 23 carbon 14 1.664  .pair 4ig5 4 lithium 82 argon 99 2.5506 ...here the column entries don't lie just one below another however indentation is same for all.  ..i have tried with 't' but that produce same randomized result..please help."
