"blank's textract cuts lines i'm using textract to get text from documents. i use it like this:..lines = textract.process(file).decode('utf-8').splitlines()...but if the lines are too long, textract cuts them to 80 characters. as i know, textract uses antiword which has an option -w width and if the width is equal to 0, the whole paragraph is printed. is there such option in textract?"
