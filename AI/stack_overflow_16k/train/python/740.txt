"printing non-integer as output here is the code i have written. everything runs as expected. my question is, when i type a non-integer and receive the error message the pay is still printed with the repeating non-integer entered. how can i fix what i have to either not print pay or leave it blank?..output..hours = input(""enter hours: "")..rate = input(""enter rate: "")..ot_rate = 1.5..try:.    hours = int(hours).    rate = int(rate).except:print(""error, please enter numeric input"")..def computepay(hours, rate):.    if hours &gt; 40:.        ot_hr = hours - 40.        hours -= ot_hr .        ot_pay = ((ot_hr) * (rate) * (ot_rate)).        return (hours * rate) + ot_pay.    else:.        return (hours * rate)..print(""pay:"")..print(computepay(hours, rate))"
