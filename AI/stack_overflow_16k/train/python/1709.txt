"add text to end of line without loading file i need to store information into a very big file, in form of many dictionaries. that's not so important, is just to say that i tried to first get all the data into these dictionaries and i run out of memory (~60gb)...fine, so i want to add the data in the file without actually loading it in memory, by doing a loop on the lines and attaching to each line a bit of text. is that possible? if so, how?"
