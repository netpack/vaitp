"need to sort out strings from a text file, blank i've made a program that's looking through social security numbers and putting them into a textfile either as i wrote them into the program (if the number was valid). or with a comment like the number is too long if the number is too long...now i want to be able to ""call for them"" separatly but i have no idea how to separate the valid numbers from the invalid ones in my textfile...def showallnumbers():.    print (""all numbers:"").    textfile = open(""textfile.txt"", ""r"").    data = textfile.read().    print (data).    textfile.close...this is how i call for them all but how do i get just the ones with comments like below, and how do i get the ones without these kind of comments?..if socialsecuritynumber.isdigit()== false:.    print (number, ""t"", ""not only digits"").    textfile.write(""n"" + socialsecuritynumber + ""t"" + ""not only digits"" ).    return false...sorry for messy text but would appreciate help!..edit - this is how it looks in the text file...1992051155700   too many digits.9205115570.92051155700.199205115570    incorrect form.thats how the textfile looks but without the 1, 2 ,3 ,4"
