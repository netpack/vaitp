"assign values to list of variables in blank i have made a small demo of a more complex problem..def f(a):.    return tuple([x for x in range(a)])..d = {}.[d['1'],d['2']] = f(2).print d.# {'1': 0, '2': 1} .# works...now suppose the keys are programmatically generated.how do i achieve the same thing for this case?..n = 10.l = [x for x in range(n)].[d[x] for x in l] = f(n).print d.# syntaxerror: can't assign to list comprehension"
