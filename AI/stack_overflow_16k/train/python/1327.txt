can i distribute traffic between 2 servers i have a server with a web front-end (webserver). this webserver makes a call to a service on another server (server2). due to heavy load i have added another instance of server2 (server3)...i want to distribute the load between server 2 and server 3. i know load balancers usually do this type of thing - but its not suitable in this scenario...i want to add some logic on the webserver to distribute the load - something very simple...is there any blank libraries out there that will do this?..i'm not really sure what i am looking for or what to google.
