"path to desktop on windows without having to know username i'm use py2exe to create a .exe file so that someone without blank on their computer can run a script. because i'm creating an alias (shortcut) of the .exe file, i need to hardcode the path to the folder containing the files that the blank script targets. i also need to make sure that it will work on anyone's desktop (regardless of username) and work in a folder called reports. i tried using the following line of code but i got an invalid syntax error:..cwd = r""os.path.expanduser(""~/desktop/reports"")""...i wondered if anyone could provide any advice to help solve this?..thanks in advance"
