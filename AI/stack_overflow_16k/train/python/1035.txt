"blank, datetime.date: difference between two days i'm playing around with 2  objects {@link http://docs.blank.org/library/datetime.html#datetime.date}..i would like to calculate all the days between them, assuming that date 1 >= date 2, and print them out. here is an example what i would like to achieve. but i don't think this is efficient at all. is there a better way to do this?...# i think +2 because this calc gives only days between the two days, .# i would like to include them.daysdiff = (dateto - datefrom).days + 2..while (daysdiff > 0):.     rptdate = datefrom.today() - timedelta(days=daysdiff).     print rptdate.strftime('%y-%m-%d').     daysdiff -= 1"
