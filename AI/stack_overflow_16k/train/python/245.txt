"'decimal' object is not iterable when trying to extend list i have the following -..db = mariadb.connect(host=host,.                     user=someuser,.                     passwd=somepass)..cursor = db.cursor(mariadb.cursors.dictcursor)..#get the top 5 largest tables inside of the database.cursor.execute('select table_schema as `database`, table_name as `table`, round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) `size in mb`  from information_schema.tables  order by (data_length + index_length) desc limit 5;').data = cursor.fetchall()..for item in data:.   dbsize.extend(float(item['size in mb']))...this is giving me the following error - ..'decimal' object is not iterable..if i just print them (instead of adding them to a list) it prints out the correct values.  how can i get this code to add each item to this list successfully?  i tried changing them to floats, but got the same error...thanks."
