"passing command line arguments in blank - is there more than one standard input? so i'm working on something right now and i'm trying to be able to run it in the command line. i was able to run my blank file given this command ""blank ./blankprogram.py arg1""..however, ..""blank ./blankprogram.py &lt; arg1"" ..should apparently work as well. e.g. this article says that the ""symbol"" indicates that arg1 is suppose to be inputted into the program on the left. am i missing something? is blank an exception and can arguments only be passed via a space? thank you!"
