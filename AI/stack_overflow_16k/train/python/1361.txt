"how do i add both a variable and a string into the same print statement? i'm trying to write a basic blank rpg for my friend, and i'm trying to make a stat generator. from what i learned in classes, i'm supposed to print('your ability score in this is ' + var1 + '.')..here's the entire code block where i'm getting the error...your elemental attack is '''+ elematk + '''.''')...and the error i'm getting is..  file ""/users/data censored/desktop/basic rpg.py"", line 24, in &lt;module&gt;.    your elemental attack is '''+ elematk + '''.''').typeerror: can only concatenate str (not ""int"") to str...maybe i'm just bad at this. i looked at another answer saying that commas separate a string and a var, but that didn't work either."
