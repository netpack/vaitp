"replace duplicates of block size less than threshold - blank how do i remove consecutive duplicates of block size less than some threshold (say 4 here) from a list like this in blank?...  l = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]...i want the result to be like this:...  o = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]...the new list should also replace the consecutive duplicates of block size less than threshold (here 4) with neighbor values (like filling with neighbors)...i was thinking of some king of smoothing filter but couldn't find. also, i was thinking of writing raw code for this but not able to think of logic...assume that it is binary list."
