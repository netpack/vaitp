"float rounding problems in blank amount = 0.002638309660058967.price = 1392.18..lowest_ask = 1391.6..result = price*amount/lowest_ask..print(result)...the above code will print out:..0.002639409271731024...however when i perform the calculation here: http://web2.0calc.com/.it gives me: 0.0026394092717310237698..so obviously blank is rounding up the result of this calculation......my question is, how do you prevent blank from rounding up result? i.e. i want result to be: 0.002639409271731023"
