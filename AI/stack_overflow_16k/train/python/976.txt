"how to shorten year into two-number integer in blank? i have a basic block of code, and a portion of it asks the user their year of birth. in order to complete the program, i need their year (e.g. 1997) to be shortened into a two-number integer (e.g. 97). at the moment, the only way i can work out is to subtract 2000, but obviously that barely works...year=input(""and finally, what's the year of your birthday? "").shortyear=int(year)-2000...i have researched online into slicing strings and integers but none of them seem to work for me. i'm still extremely basic at blank but i'm guessing that there should be a way to select only the last two characters in an integer?:..intyear=int(year).shortyear=year[-2:]...that doesn't seem to work for me, though. hopefully, someone will have an answer that works!..thank you very much!"
