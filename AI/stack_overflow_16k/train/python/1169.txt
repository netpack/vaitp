"how do you obtain the body of a function? i would need to separate the signature from the body of a function in blank, i.e. :..def mult(a, b):.    ""multiplication"".    if a or b is none:.       # border case.       return none.    else:.       return a * b...(the function is there for demonstration only)...i know that inspect.getsourcelines(mult) will get me the full code, but i would like to have only the body, i.e. less the signature and the docstring:..if a or b is none:.   # border case.   return none.else:.   return a * b...is there an elegant way to obtain that, ideally using blank3 built-in parsing tools, rather than string manipulation?"
