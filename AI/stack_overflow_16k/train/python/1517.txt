"blank: print condition i found that i just asked the wrong question a few minutes ago, sorry about that. i ran a code that need to identify if the word in certain location matches my condition. ..the original code is not in english, i just tried to use a simple way to show you the problem i had. there's actually no space between words in my language, so use split or re is not working...i need to find the word before ""car"" to know whether someone loves the car or not. so i used location as conditions to identify it. ..for example: (but it will be too long)..message=""i do not like cars.""..#print(message[14:18])  #cars starts from location 14.location = 14..if message[int(loca)-5:int(loca)-1]==""like"":.    print(""like"").elif message[int(loca)-8:int(loca)-1]==""dislike"":.    print(""dislike"").elif message[int(loca)-5:int(loca)-1]==""hate"":.    print(""hate"").elif message[int(loca)-5:int(loca)-1]==""cool"":.    print(""cool"")...i actually used this one in my code, but found that i could not print the word:..if (.    message[int(location) - 5:int(location) - 1] == ""like"" or.    message[int(location) - 8:int(location) - 1] == ""dislike"" or.    message[int(location) - 5:int(location) - 1] == ""hate"" or.    message[int(location) - 5:int(location) - 1] == ""cool"".):.    #print ""like"".    #unable to do it...is there anyway i can solve it by printing the matching word?"
