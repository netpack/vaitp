"turning list from text file into blank list i am teaching a class and i want them to read a list of 10 words from a text file and then randomly display 9 of them in a 3 by 3 grid...my thoughts were as follows:..1) read the text file using readlist = open('n:words.txt', 'r')..2) blank turns this into a list blank randomly chooses 9 using import random ..3) blank diplays the list in a 3x3 grid..i have tried various things - readline, readlines, append characters - but with no or limited success.  i am missing something obvious but can't see it...this adds the first word to the list, but how do i add the second word:..readlist = open('n:words.txt', 'r').listwords=[].firstword=readlist.read(5).listwords.append(firstword).print (listwords)"
