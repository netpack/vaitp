"if statements in blank not working i recently started learning coding. on my first assignment i was asked to make a program that allows the user to choose names and then pick random ones. here's what i came up with:..def main():.  name = [""josh"", ""omar"", ""shatil"", ""cathrin""].  while true:.    print (name).    continueprogram = input(""would you like to continue"").    if continueprogram.lower() ==""yes"":.      print(changelist(name)).    else:.      break.def changelist(items):.  changelist= input(""enter 'a' to append list, 'r' to remove an item from the list: "").  if changelist.lower() == ""a"":.    appendlist = input(""what name would you like to add to the list?: "") items.append(appendlist).  if changelist.lower() ==""r"":.    removelist = input (""what name would you liket to remove from the list?: "")items.remove(removelist).    return items.main()...the last 2 if statements aren't working."
