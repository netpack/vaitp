"how to make this battleship game more user friendly in terms of values? i have a battleship game set up in blank, however the grid i set up ranged between 0 and 5. meaning the first row and columns of the battleship will be (0,0) i don't want this however, as any stranded user will likely count from 1, so they'll put (1,1) or (1,2) the value 0 won't be a value they'd think to enter. how can i make my program reflect that, in a way where 1,1 is the beginning column and row not the 2nd.  as the user can only enter a value between 0 and 4, 5 is represented as an invalid value and it says it's not on the grid. ..so the only possible combinations are these:..row: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,.column: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4..i want it to be:..row: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.column 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..here is my code: ..import random..battleship_board = []..for x in range(0,5):.  battleship_board.append([""o""] * 5)...def print_battleship_board(battleship_board):.  for row in battleship_board:.    print ("" "".join(row))..print (""let's play a game of battleships!"").print_battleship_board(battleship_board)...def random_battleship_board_row(battleship_board):.return random.randint(0, len(battleship_board)-1)..def random_battleship_board_column(battleship_board):.return random.randint(0, len(battleship_board[0])-1)..battleship_board_row = random_battleship_board_row(battleship_board).battleship_board_column = random_battleship_board_column(battleship_board)...print (battleship_board_row) .print (battleship_board_column) ..for turn in range(5):..guess_battleship_board_row = int(input(""guess the x coordinate:"")).guess_battleship_board_column = int(input(""guess the y coordinate:""))...if guess_battleship_board_row == battleship_board_row and guess_battleship_board_column == battleship_board_column:.    print (""you sunk the battleship!"").    print (""my ship was here: ["" + str(battleship_board_row) + ""]["" + str(battleship_board_column) + ""]"").    break..else:..        if turn + 1 == 5:.            battleship_board[guess_battleship_board_row][guess_battleship_board_column] = ""x"".            print_battleship_board(battleship_board).            print (""game over"").            print (""my ship was here: ["" + str(battleship_board_row) + ""]["" + str(battleship_board_column) + ""]"")..        if (guess_battleship_board_row &lt; 0 or guess_battleship_board_row &gt; 4) or (guess_battleship_board_column &lt; 0 or guess_battleship_board_column &gt; 4):.            print (""the inserted value is not on the grid."").        elif(battleship_board[guess_battleship_board_row ][guess_battleship_board_column] == ""x""):.            print (""you already inserted this combination"").        else:.            print (""you missed my battleship"").            battleship_board[guess_battleship_board_row][guess_battleship_board_column] = ""x"".        print (""number of turns:"", turn + 1,""out of 5"").        print_battleship_board(battleship_board)"
