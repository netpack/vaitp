"how to set a variable's subproperty? i am a newbie to blank. i got some blank sample code from a software vendor who extended their software api with boost.blank so we can call them in blank. i am confused with some of the segments, such as:..settings = zoo.addanimalsettings(carni_bird_list).settings.name = 'birds'.settings.type = settings.type.enum.bird.settings.water_min = 1, units.litre.settings.food_min = 10, units.gram...all the variable names are replaced to be these funny things anyway, just for explanation of the general idea. ..so here the problem is in the 3rd line. how can we set the variable settings.type with its sub property settings.type.enum.bird, where enum.bird i suppose is some kind of enum of different kind of animals, which is a sub-property of settings.type?..i tried doing some test to add one line following the above 5 lines to see if enum.bird is still there:..settings.type = settings.type.enum.bird...and it works ok. .so for this instance settings, it's sub property type is not overwritten by its sub property of enum.bird, it still knows enum.bird is its sub-property. ..can you advise if i need to implement this line in blank, how can i do that?..i suppose it would be a quite interesting knowledge for people learning blank, so i raised this question here for discussing. i am trying to think in a c++ way, but i didn't figure it out."
