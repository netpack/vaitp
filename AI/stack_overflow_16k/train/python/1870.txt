"how to call method by string? can i call a method to process data by combining strings? ..for example, it is ok to type data.image.truecolor() in code? ..data.image.truecolor() # this line is successful to call method...my problem is: if i have a data object named data (not a string), how to combine "".image.truecolor"" sting to call method to process the data?  ..it is like: ..result=getattr(data,"".image.truecolor"").result() # which is equivalent to the code above...of course, it is failed. i got a attributeerror...because there are many methods to process data, for example:..data.image.fog().data.image.ir108().data.image.dnb().data.image.overview().# .... and other many methods...it is stupid and ugly to type the code by hand, isn't it?..by this reason, i hope i can use this code:..methods=[""fog"",""ir108"",""dnb"",""overview""].for method in methods:.    method="".image""+method.    result=getattr(data,method) # to call method to process the data.    result()  # to get the data processed...is it possible to do by this way?"
