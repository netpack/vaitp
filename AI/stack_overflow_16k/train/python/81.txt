"my blank game code is not working i am trying to code a sort of walking on the ledge random chance game, users would input a certain amount they would like to bet and then depending on how many steps they would take, they would either live or fall off the ledge. the code so far is far from being finished but i have encountered a problem and i was wondering if someone could help me fix it. ..import time.import random...class player():.    def __init__(self,name):.        self.name = name.        self.luck = 2.        self.gold = 10..def main():.    print(""hello what is your name?"").    option = input(""--&gt; "").    global playerig.    playerig = player(option).    start1()..def start1():.    print(""name: {}"".format(playerig.name)).    print(""luck: {}"".format(playerig.luck)).    print(""gold: {}"".format(playerig.gold)).    inputgold()..def inputgold():.    print(""please input how much gold you would like to play with"").    goldinput = input(""--&gt; "").    strgold = str(goldinput).    print(""you inputted {}"".format(strgold)).    if strgold &lt;= playerig.gold:.        print(""you don't have enough gold"").        inputgold().    else:.        print(""get ready to start!"").    ledge()..def ledge():.    print(""you are standing on a ledge with an unknown length"").    time.sleep(1).    choice = input(""how many steps do you want to take forward? between 1-100"").    if choice == step1:.        print(""you have fallen off the ledge"").        playerig.gold -= goldinput.        print(""gold: "".format(playerig.gold)).    elif choice == step2:.        print(""you..."").        time.sleep(1).        print(""didn't fall off the ledge!"").        playerig.gold*1.2.        print(""gold: "".format(playerig.gold)).    else:.        print(""you slipped off the ledge and face planted onto the side walk"").        playerig.gold -= goldinput.        print(""gold: "".format(playerig.gold))..def steps():.    step1 = random.randint(10,30).    step2 = random.randint(30,50).    step3 = random.randint(50,100)..main()...when i run it is says:..if strgold &lt;= playerig.gold: typeerror: unorderable types: str() &lt;= int() ..how can i fix it?"
