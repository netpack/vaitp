"why am i getting a ""type 'bool' is not iterable"" if i am not trying to iterate? could someone with superior blank skills please explain why am i getting a ""bool is not iterable"" error, when i am only doing some dict lookups and comparisons?..this is the last line of the stack trace:..---&gt; 54     if 'identifiers' in document and 'doi' in document['identifiers'] and document['identifiers']['doi'] == row['doi']:.     55         print 'found doi'.     56         return true..typeerror: (""argument of type 'bool' is not iterable"", u'occurred at index 2914')...is best practice to use a try/except to attempt to read my dict and catch if the key does not exist?"
