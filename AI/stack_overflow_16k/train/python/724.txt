"last item in a list doesn't count i am writing a program for a school assignment and i have to use data from a .csv file. when i open the file, i read it, and leave it unformatted (all items are strings). i only separate them with commas and create lists within a list. i need to find the last item in a list (there are 3 lists with the same last item). it didn't work in my mail program so i used blank shell to confirm that something is wrong. ..&gt;&gt;&gt; l=[['2', '13:00', '22', '0', 'true', '5n'], ['-1', '14:00', '22', '0', 'true', '5n'], ['2', '15:00', '23', '0', 'true', '5n']].&gt;&gt;&gt; ""5n"" in l.false.&gt;&gt;&gt; ""5"" in l.false.&gt;&gt;&gt; ...this is the response it gives me. why does it not see the last item? why is there this unnecesary ""new line"" character?the formatted version shows it as 5 (integer) so it is clearly there."
