"unable to access value of global variable in functions other than it is initialized i have a written blank code for real time system in which i am acquiring the data from one functions and assigning it to a variable which is actually a global variable but when i tried to use it in other functions i am unable to get updated value in other functions. how to get rid of this problem. sample code which will give an elaborate idea what i am exactly doing is as follows...obtained_value = 0 ..### inside the continuous loop statement ###.def startloop(self):.    global obtained_value.    obtained_value = acquire_data()  ## obtained value is getting updated after every 0.25 seconds ##.    ## other statements ##..def some_functions(self):.    ### want to do something which depend on value ###.    print obtained_value             ## does not print value inside ""obtained_value"".    val1 = obtained_value * 10.    print val1.    ## etc etc ### ...i am not getting any value printed corresponding to print statement inside the some_function. its seems like value of global variable is not getting updated. how to fix this problem. any suggestion will be appreciated. thanks in advance."
