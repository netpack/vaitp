"how to get the list with the higher sum of its elements i was wondering if anyone could help me with a blank problem i have. i have four lists, each list holds floats (decimals). i'm adding all the floats that each list contains. the part i'm stuck on is i want to know which of the four list has a higher sum. i know i could use if statements but does anyone know a more of a efficient way. for instance:..foodmart = [12.33,5.55].nike = [42.20,69.99].gas_station = [0.89,45.22].toy_store = [10.99,15.32]"
