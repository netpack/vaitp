"substring comparision in blank while reading from file i writing a blank program to copy following lines ( around 10000) from one file to other. condition is that if source register and destination register in lwz is same make that line bold and copy. otherwise simply copy...line 850:   lwz     r3, 0(r17).line 851:   1004f0: 80 71 00 00     lwz r3,0(r17).line 1039:  lwz r5,0(r3).line 1040:   100598:    80 a3 00 00     lwz r5,0(r3).line 2029:     lwz     r9, 0(r4)               /* load half word from source */.line 2030:   1009f8:    81 24 00 00     lwz r9,0(r4).line 2126:   100a5c:    81 3f 00 10     lwz r9,16(r31).line 2131:   100a68:    80 1f 00 10     lwz r0,16(r31)...i have written following program to copy lines from one file to other file. ..import os.import sys.f1 = open('test.txt').f2 = open('output.txt', 'w').str2 = ""r9"";.i=0.while i &lt; 10:.     lines=f1.readline().     #here i dont know.     f2.write(str(lines)).     i=i+1;.f1.close().f2.close()...can any one suggest how to convert lines read from file into a string so that i can apply string operation on that. while i apply directly it gives error."
