"blank operator overloading __div__ i have a class that has the functions mul and div implemented as follows:..def __mul__(self, other):.    return foo(self.a * other)..def __div__(self, other):.    return foo(self.a / other)...the multiplication (e.g. a * b, where a is an instance of the class foo and b is an integer) works fine, but the division (a / b) gives an error saying the operator is not supported. how do i get around this?..typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'foo' and 'int'"
