"prime number finder, it's in blank # this program will test numbers and check if they are prime numbers or even numbers..num = eval(input('enter a number: '))#generating user input.for i in range(num):.    x = 2.    if num % 2 == 0: #test for even numbers.        print(num, x, 'is even').    else:.        while num % x != 0:#the idea here is to enter a loop and test the numbers against x=2, x +=1... to check if they are divisible.            x += 1         #by x.            break.        if num % x == 0:    #x is however either 2 or 3. it never advances to four and numbers like 25 become prime numbers.            print(num,x, 'is odd').        else:.            print(num,x, 'is prime').    num -=1...there's a logical flaw in the code i just can't figure out where it is"
