"extract full data from *.pickle file pickle file is stored in binary form and i want to know is there any way to convert this  file into unicode and store it in *.txt file.  ..i am using a toolkit where the output is stored in a *.pickle file. .now i want to read the output of that *.pickle  file  and i am using the following commands ..with open('filename','rb') as f:.    abc = pickle.load(f)...now when i am writing "" abc "" in blank shell this is not displaying the full file. the *.pickle file is a huge file and while displaying it on terminal it is not showing the full file. then i  tried write this file into  some other *.txt file but again it is giving some errors. method to convert it to *.txt file is ..f = open(""pul.txt"", ""w"").f.write(abc)      .f.close()...but it is giving the error and not writing the data from *.pickle file into ""pul.txt""..i want to know how can i check the full data in *.pickle file, e.g., if i have to grep certain things from this *.pickle file how will i do ? is there any way ?..thanks"
