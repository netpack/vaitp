"why is the if __name__ == ""__main__"": main() pattern used instead of putting the main code in the if statement? although i've been using blank for a while, and a common pattern you see is these two statements:..def main():.    # fancy code here .if __name__ == ""__main__"":.    main()...my question is, why wouldn't you use this pattern instead?..if __name__ == ""__main__"":.    # fancy code here...is this just in case you want to import main from another place? or is there some other reason you might want to do this?"
