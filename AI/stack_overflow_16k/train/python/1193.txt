"pulling files and timestamps from a directory and subdirectories i have a working script that will print all files in a given directory.  i would like help making it do two additional things:..(1) also be able to print the date_created or time stamp for each file..(2) do all of the above not only for files in the given directory, but in all subdirectories as well...here is the working script:..from os import listdir.from os.path import isfile, join.from sys import argv..script, filename = argv..mypath = os.getcwd()..allfiles = [ f for f in listdir(mypath) if isfile(join(mypath,f)) ]..output = open(filename, 'w')..for i in allfiles:.    string = ""%s"" %i.    output.write(string + ""n"")..output.close()..print ""directory printed.""...i would hope to be able to print something like (filename + "", "" + timestamp + ""n""), or some substitute...thanks!"
