"passing variables between methods in blank? i have a class and two methods. one method gets input from the user and stores it in two variables, x and y. i want another method that accepts an input so adds that input to x and y. when i run calculate(z) for some number z, it gives me errors saying the global variables x and y aren't defined. obviously this means that the calculate method isn't getting access to x and y from getinput(). what am i doing wrong?..class simpleclass (object):.    def getinput (self):.            x = input(""input value for x: "").            y = input(""input value for y: "").    def calculate (self, z):.            print x+y+z"
