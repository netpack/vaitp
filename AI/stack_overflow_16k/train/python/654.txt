"blank: how to show results on a web page? most likely it's a dumb question for those who knows the answer, but i'm a beginner, and here it goes:..i have a blank script which i run in a command-line with some parameter, and it prints me some results. let's say results are some html code...i never done any blank programming for web, and couldn't figure it out... i need to have a page (ok, i know how to upload files to a server, apache is running, blank is installed on the server...) with an edit field, which will accept that parameter, and submit button, and i need it to ""print"" the results on a web page after the user submitted a proper parameter, or show any output that in a command-line situation are printed...i've read dive into blank's chapters about ""html processing"" and ""http web services"", but they do not describe what i'm looking for...if the answer isn't short, i would very much appreciate links to the more relevant stuff to read or maybe the key words to google for it."
