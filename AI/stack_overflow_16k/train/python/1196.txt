"what is the most efficient way to find a path from a file? i have a file on my computer that i would like to locate the full path of...the only way i can think of to find the path of that file is to use os.walk until i eventually find the file. this method can take a long time, as there are many many files...the file is user data, here is basically the sub path i am looking for googlechromeuser data...is there any faster way to get the full path of the file?..edit:.the file is generally found under appdatalocal. if there is a shortcut to get to this path, that would suffice."
