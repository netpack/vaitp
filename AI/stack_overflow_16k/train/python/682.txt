"file writing does not happen when it is supposed to happen in the program flow this is not a new problem for me. from c to perl to blank on windows mobile, windows xp and other windows versions this problem persists and f**ks my nerves...now in my latest script it again happens. .to be more concrete: i have coded in blank a trivial script. now the script writes correctly to the file when run from the debugger, but out of the debugger it does not work correctly..it does not write to file when it should. .i am using blank 2.6 with eclipse and pydev. ..this is the code..import httplib2.import thread..ht = httplib2.http();.list = [].k = 0..def check(proxy, port):.    global list.    global k.    try:.        head = ht.request(proxy, 'head').    except:.        return.    k = k + 1.    list.append(proxy).    list.append(port)...def onlistcaller(proxylist, outfile, nlistlen):.    global list.    global k.    filei = open(proxylist, 'r').    fileo = open(outfile, 'a')..    while 1:.        proxy = filei.readline().        if not proxy: continue.        port = filei.readline()..        proxy = proxy.rstrip().        port = port.rstrip()..        thread.start_new(check, (proxy, port,))..        if k &gt;= nlistlen:.            for t in list:.                fileo.write(t + ""n"").            list = [].            fileo.close().            fileo = open(outfile, 'a').            k = 0...onlistcaller('c:proxyinput.txt', 'c:proxychecked.txt', 1)   ...the problem is in the onlistcaller at the if k>=nlistlen..the file should be updated when k is >= then a given value..thanks to everyone."
