"dump variable to file i am brand new at blank and coming from php.  how do i dump all contents of a variable into a file, similarly to var_dump?  after searching around, i've come up with this:..from inspect import getmembers.from pprint import pprint.pprint(getmembers(_variable_))...however it shows up in the command window not a friendly readable file.  i do know how to write to a file and i've tried this:..f.write(pprint(getmembers(_variable_)))...but it gives me a type error.  would appreciate help, thanks."
