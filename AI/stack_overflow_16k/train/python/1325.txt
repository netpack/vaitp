"gaussian elimination with pivoting in blank i am trying to write a function that will solve a linear system using gaussian elimination with pivoting. i am not allowed to use any modules either. .can someone help me out here? i don't know what i'm doing wrong. thanks in advance :) :) :) ..first i set up augmented matrix m, then i do the pivoting and row operations and finally i do the back substitution..def linearsolver(a,b):   .  n = len(a) .  m = a ..  i = 0 .  for x in m:.   x.append(b[i]) .   i += 1 ..  for k in range(n):   .   for i in range(k,n): .     if abs(m[i][k]) &gt; abs(m[k][k]):  .        m[k], m[i] = m[i],m[k]  .     else: .        pass  ..   for j in range(k+1,n):.       q = m[j][k] / m[k][k] .       for m in range(k, n+1):         .          m[j][m] +=  q * m[k][m]..  x = [0 for i in range(n)]..  x[n] =float(m[n][n+1])/m[n][n].  for i in range (n-1,-1,-1): .    z = 0 .    for j in range(i+1,n):.        z = z  + float(m[i][j])*x[j] .    x[i] = float(m[i][n+1] - z)/m[i][i].  print x"
