"how to delete multiple lines in a blank console window? i am currently working on a text-adventure, which should have a more or less complex fight system.  to create such, i decided to generate a 16x16 tile battlefield, which will be represented by ascii-characters.  but, because a fight may take more than turn, i don't want to reprint the battlefield multiple times, but delete the ""old"" one and print the new situation to the same place.  but i suppose that it won't work with sys.stdout.write() and sys.stdout.flush() since there have to be removed multiple lines.  so my question is: how do i accomplish my goal?  at the moment i open a new console window, where everything is reprinted, which is ahem... not very elegant...another problem would be the cross-platform use of the programm."
