"expressions of class in blank in one of our homework problems, we need to write a class in blank called gate which contains the drawing and function of many different gates in a circuit. it describes as follows:   ..in1 = gate(""input"").out1 = gate(""output"").not1 = gate(""not"")...here in1, out1, not1 are all instances of this class. what do the (""input"") (""output"") (""not"") mean? are they subclass or something?.we are only told that when we define a class using: ..class gate(object)...when we make an instance we use:..in1 = gate()...i haven't seen stuff inside a () after the class name, how to understand that?"
