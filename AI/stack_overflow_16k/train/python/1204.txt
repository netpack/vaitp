"how to check if all the digits of a number are odd in blank? i was told to solve a problem in which i would have to find out the number of 4-digit numbers which are all composed of odd digits. i tried the following blank code:..new_list =[] # a list which holds the numbers.for a in range(1111,10000):.    for b in str(a):.        if int(b) % 2 == 1:.            new_list.append(a).print len(new_list)...however, it has a flaw in the second loop's if statement which only checks if the current digit is odd and it also caused the digits to be added multiple times, not to mention they didn't meet the criteria. so how do i solve this problem using blank? and if you could write a function that checks if all the numbers of a list(argument) are composed of numbers which consist of only odd/even digits, it would be great too...edit: i also need a list of the numbers, that's why multiplication can't do all of the work."
