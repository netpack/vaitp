"how to sort such a complex list in blank? x = [([('x', 2), ('m', 3)], 'a'), ([('y', 4), ('t',8), ('d', '100')], 'c'), ([('a', 1)], 'b')]...i want to sort by the inner tuple integer, i.e. 2, 4, 1. so the sorted list should be:..sorted_x = [(('a', 1), 'b'), (('x', 2), 'a'), (('y', 4), 'c')]...it should look like something like this:..x_sorted = sorted(x, key=lambda tup: tup[1])...but the tup[1] is for the first level of tuple, and i can write tup[tupe[1]]...i think i need to flatten the list first, and then sort it. ..edit:..thanks for the solution for the very complex list sorting. it turns out that i should actually sort this (sorry for the problem statement modification):..x = ([('x', 2), ('m', 3), ('n', 1)], 'a')...result:..sorted_x = ([('n', 1), ('x', 2), ('m', 3)], 'a')...i tried this:..x_sorted = sorted(x, key=lambda tup: tup[0][1])...but get this error:..x_sorted = sorted(x, key=lambda tup: tup[0][1]).indexerror: string index out of range"
