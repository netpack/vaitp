"determining the most frequent casing of a word in blank i have a text and a i want to determine the most frequent casing of each word and create a dictionary with it. this is an extract of the text:..pencil: a pencil is an object we use to write. pencil should not be confused by pen, which is a different object. a pencil is usually made from a pigment core inside a protective casing. ...for example, a word like ""pencil"" could appear as ""pencil"", ""pencil"" or ""pencil"" in my text. i would like to create a function that would first determine which of those options is the most frequent one. i have started by classifying all the words into three groups, depending on casing, though i don't know how to determine which case is the most frequent one (i guess i'd have to do a comparison across the three lists, but i don't know how to do that):..list_upper = [].list_lower = [].list_both = []..for word in text:.    if isupper(word):.        list_upper.append(word).    if islower(word):.        list_lower.append(word).    if word == word.title():.        list_both.append(word)...then, it will create a dictionary in which the first key would be the lowercase words and the values would be the most frequent type. for example: pencil, pencil. i'm not sure how to do this either... this is my desired output:..my_dictionary = {""pencil"":""pencil"", ""the"":""the""...}"
