"blank: how to separate the user's first and last name using str.partition i'm still a beginner in using blank and i'm having a problem with creating function prompting the user to enter a name and then returning it to a tuple. but the main concern i am dealing with is that from that tuple, i must separate the first and last name and then assigning to separate variables using the specific method str.partition. ..i have tried writing the following code below but still is a bit confused / quite seem to pinpoint what's wrong with my code. ..def get_names():.    name = (""please enter your name: "").    get_names = name.    name.partition("""").    return name"
