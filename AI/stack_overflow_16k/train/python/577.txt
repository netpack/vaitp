"blank: what does for x in a[1:] mean? i was trying to understand kadane's algorithm from wikipedia, when i found this:..def max_subarray(a):.    max_ending_here = max_so_far = a[0].    for x in a[1:]:.        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x).        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here).    return max_so_far...i'm not familiar with blank. i tried to google what this syntax does but i couldn't find the right answer because i didn't know what's it called. but, i figured a[1:] is the equivalent of omitting a[0], so i thought for x in a[1:]: is equivalent to for(int i = 1; i &lt; a.length; i++) in java..but, after changing for x in a[1:]: to for x in range(1,len(a)), i got the wrong result..sorry if this is a stupid question, but i don't know where else to find the answer. can somebody tell me what this syntax does and what is it called? also, could you give me the equivalent of for x in a[1:]: in java?"
