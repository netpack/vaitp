"skip to next item in dictionary i have nested for loops, i think this is making things complicated here. .here is the dict i have ..dict1 = {'1': '##', '2': '##'}...i am looping through this dict and here is the code..for key,value in dict1.items():.    ###some code ###.        if ##condition is true move to next key in the for loop which is '2'##.           dict1.next()...i have used dict1.next(). but this is throwing an error ""dict' object has no attribute 'next'""..even tried dict1[key] += 1 and dict1[key] = dict1.setdefault(key, 0) + 1..i understand when skipping to next key in dictionary we have to refer index of key to move on to next item. but no luck with anything and i m not sure using ""continue"" would fulfil my purpose, because currently i have only one value for each corresponding key (""continue"" works if it so), but i want to use this code even if each key had more than one value respectively. such that ""if"" condition is true for key 1 and its first corresponding value, the next iteration should be for key 2 and its values respectively...sorry for long story"
