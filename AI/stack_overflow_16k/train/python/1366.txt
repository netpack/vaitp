"blank 2.7 output from text files without last blank line i've started to learn blank and i stucked on one task - i have 10 text files and i am trying to write from them two outputs:.output 1 should look like.folder and name of file               header.folder and name of file               header......output 2 should look like.folder and name of file | text | text | text.folder and name of file | text | text | text......although i looked throught many of questions, i have not found, how to delete (or not write) last blank row - there should be always only text..all solutions i tried (tell(), rstrip(), ...) deleted all signs for new line, so i had file like .folder and name of file               headerfolder and name of file               header..ufortunatelly because of the task definition i am allowed to use only glob and re, so helpful sys is forbidden for me :(..i would really appreciate your help with that, this task is for me really challenging but now i do not know how to continue :)..thanks for any advice and have a nice day ;)..code i am using:..    import re, glob.    file_list = glob.glob('./input/*txt').    for file_name in file_list:.    input_file = open(file_name, 'r').    output_1 = open('file_1', 'a').    output_2 = open('file_2', 'a').    for line in input_file:.    if re.search(r's{2,}s{4,}s{1}s+:.*', line):.                    output_2.write(file_name.replace('.txt','|') + line).            if re.search(r's{3,}s{3,16}s+x?s[a-z]{3,4}d?s+d{1,3}.*', line):.                    field = re.findall('s{3,16}s{3,}', line) + re.findall('s{2}d{1,3}.*', line).                    field_join = '|'.join(field).                    field_clear = re.sub(r'(s){2,}', '', field_join).                    field_list = re.sub(' ', '|', field_clear, 1).                    output_1.write(file_name.replace('.txt','|') + field_list + 'n').    output_2.close().    output_1.close().    input_file.close()"
