"blank how to compare two file lines i need a automated way of getting c programming exam cheaters. the first thing i want to do is compare two files and thought i could do it comparing the line of a file with all the lines of another, if equals then a counter receives +1...one smart thing to do is to ignore all spaces and {} but i don't know a smart way of doing it, i see that the .replace() made the performance really bad, any other solution? basically what i did so far but not working as i want:..def line_compare(filename1, filename2):.    counter = 0.    result = {}.    with open(filename1) as codefile1:.        with open(filename2) as codefile2:.            lines1 = codefile1.readlines().            lines2 = codefile2.readlines().            for line1 in lines1:.                for line2 in lines2:.                    if line1 == line2:.                        counter += 1.            key = filename1 + "" "" + filename2.            result[key] = counter / len(lines1).    return result...the idea of the dict is putting the name of the two files as key and the value is the percentage of the code that would be probably copied. it is giving me a lot of false-positive, is this the best way of doing it in blank?"
