"multiprocessing in a loop issue i'm attempting to start a process for item in list using an if statement. the if statement (if condition met) will call a function passing in 2 args. the function then iterates through another list running a subprocess call for each in the list. now for some reason i'm not getting any output from the subprocess. if i run the same command in the command line it works fine, and it worked fine before i started down the multiprocessing road. could anyone kindly explain whats going on?..this is how the function is being called...userlist = (name1, name2, name3).if condition == true:.    for user in userlist: .        p = multiprocessing.process(target=tllocaltf, args=(serverlist, user)).        jobs.append(p).        p.start()  ...this is the function it is calling:..def tllocaltf(domain, user):.#function iterates list of target users locally.    print (domain,user) #this prints out the username and domain as expected.    print ""targeted users found on localhostn"".    try:.        out = subprocess.check_output([""tasklist"", ""/v"", ""/fo"", ""list"", ""/fi"", ""username eq {0}\{1}"" .format(domain, user)], stderr=subprocess.stdout).        users = [item for item in out.split() if domain in item and user in item].        sortedl = set(users).        print sortedl #this is printing set([]).        for item in sortedl: .            print item.    except calledprocesserror as e:.        errormessage = e.output.        print errormessage..    print ""ncompleted"""
