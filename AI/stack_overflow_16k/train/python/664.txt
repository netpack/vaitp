"is there a blank data structure with o(log n) deletion/insertion and supports indexing? while doing competitive coding, i came across a scenario where i needed o(log n) removal, while being able to support indexing (o(1) preferably) for a binary search. i essentially need to locate an element using a binary approach (currently using bisect), and then remove that element i found, which is currently a o(n) operation. i obviously cannot use libraries that are not built in, hence why blist is not an option, and i can't use a set because that doesn't support indexing. is there an alternative, or is using something like a binary tree the only option. if so, are there any easy pre-defined libraries in blank that i am able to use?"
