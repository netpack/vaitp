"how do you correctly test for divisibility in blank i wrote some code to evaluate the integers between x and y and check for divisibility by the integers 3 and 5..this is the code...def div_3_5(start, end):.    result = 0.    result2 = 0.    result3 = 0 .    while start &lt; end:.        result2 = start + result .        result = result2 - start + 1.        if result2 % 3==0 or 5==0:.            result3 = result3 + 1 .        else:.            result3 = result3 + 0.        return result3...i'm just a beginner but everything seems fine in the code of course unless i have used the ""or"" statement incorrectly or checked for divisibility incorrectly. which brings me to the main question. any help would be appreciated."
