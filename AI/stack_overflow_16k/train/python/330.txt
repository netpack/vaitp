[u'naftali', u'chayat', u'alvarion ltd.', u'tel aviv', u'', u'israel'],.    [u'rxe9mi', u'chayer', u'harris corporation', u'dollard-des-ormeaux', u'pq', u'canada'])...however, when i am using the code..with open(""output.csv"", ""wb"") as f:.    writer = csv.writer(f).    writer.writerows(rows)...its showing error because of the character ""rxe9mi"". any lead to solve this problem will be appreciated..thanks"
