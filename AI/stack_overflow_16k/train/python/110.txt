"program that prints one word per line need to create a program that prints one word per line, but only if that word is less than 4 character. i have this so far..the input will be a list such as ['not','very','good','at','blank']..string = input(""enter word list:"")..txt = string.split()..for words in txt:..     print(words)...when the input is a list, it prints it in one line, but if the input is just text, for example..enter word list: not very good at blank..then it'll print every word on its own single line. ..not sure how to implement a 4 character only print and not sure how to get the list to print its elements on its own lines"
