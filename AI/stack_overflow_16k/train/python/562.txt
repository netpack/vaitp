"blank - efficiently building a dictionary i am trying to build a dict(dict(dict())) out of multiple files, which are stored in different numbered directories, i.e. ../data/server01/datafile01.dat./data/server01/datafile02.dat...../data/server02/datafile01.dat./data/server02/datafile02.dat...../data/server86/datafile01.dat...../data/server86/datafile99.dat...i have a couple problems at the moment:...switching between directories ...i know that i have 86 servers, but the number of files per server may vary. i am using:..for i in range(1,86):.    basedir='/data/server%02d' % i.    for file in glob.glob(basedir+'*.dat'):.        do reading and sorting here...but i cant seem to switch between the directories properly. it just sits in the first one and gets stuck it seems when there are no files in the directory...checking if key already exists...i would like to have a function that somehow checks if a key is already present or not, and in case it isnt creates that key and certain subkeys, since one cant define dict[key1][subkey1][subsubkey1]=value..btw i am using blank 2.6.6"
