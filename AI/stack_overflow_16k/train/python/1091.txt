"easier way to add multiple list items? is there an easier way to sum together items from a list than the code i've written below? i'm new to this and this seems somewhat unwieldy.         ..n = [3,5,7].o = [4,10,8].p = [4,10,5]..lists = [n, o, p]..def sumlist(x):.    return sum(x)...def listadder(y):.    count = 0.    for item in y:.        count += sumlist(item).    return count..print listadder(lists)"
