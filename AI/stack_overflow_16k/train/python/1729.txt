"building dice combinations, in a list by tuple need to write a function called build_all_dice_pairs that generates tuples that represent all permutations of two dice throws. i must use a single comprehension to solve this. ..below is some of the certain code i have trying to pass the test:..def build_all_dice_pairs():.  dice_values = [].  dice = tuple(n for n in range(1,7)).  dice2 = tuple(i for i in range(1,7)).  print(dice).  print(dice2).  dice_values.append(dice).  dice_values.append(dice2).  print(dice_values)..  return"
