"is there way to construct frequency dictionary of numbers without cycles('for') and in one line? suppose we have an array of numbers with repetitions..is there way to construct frequency dictionary of numbers without cycles ('for') and in one line? for instance, use list comprehension or map. i attempted but i couldn't come up with better :..d_num = {}.for number in x:.    d_num.update({number : 1} if d_num.get(number) == none else {number : d_num.get(number) + 1})"
