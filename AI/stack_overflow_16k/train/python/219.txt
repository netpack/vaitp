"set value in dictionary if value not there? i am using a dictionary to store a bunch of counters where each counter is counting the occurence of a file type (.wav, .mp3, etc)...filetypecounter = {}...when i come across a certain file type i want to be able to increase a counter in a blankic way. so i am thinking.....filetypecounter[filetype] +=1...however, if the filetype is not in the dictionary i want to instantiate it to 1..so my logic is if filetype counter is there, add 1 to the counter value, else set it to one...if filetype not in filetypecounter:.    filetypecounter[filetype] = 1.else: .    filetypecounter[filetype] +=1...is there a more blankic way?"
