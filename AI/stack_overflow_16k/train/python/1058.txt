"blank: assign and read out the values of a 2-d list here is a snippet of blank code:..a = [[0]*3]*4.for i in range(4):.    for j in range(3):.        a[i][j] = i+j.        print(a[i][j]).print(a)...however, the outputs of the two prints are different...the former one prints what i want. and the second prints all the same for the 4 sublists...it seems the problem of shallow copying. i really don't understand how and why it happens...update:..after i have solved this, i found another problem:..a = [[0]*3]*4.for i in range(4):.    a[i] = [i, 2*i, 3*i]...the result is also what i want. i'm once again confused about this. ..who can tell me the difference?"
