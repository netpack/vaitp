"how to run a sequence of asynchronous shell scripts in blank i have a nodejs script using parallel async calls with callbacks in order to execute a series of shell scripts in the order they need to be run. (data analysis tasks which are dependent on the numbers being crunched by the previous steps)..pseudo-code nodejs example:..async.parallel([.  async.apply('/usr/local/bin/foo some/path/to/some/script.sh 1'),.  async.apply('/usr/local/bin/foo some/path/to/some/script.sh 2'),.], function () {.  async.parallel([async.apply('/usr/local/bin/foo some/path/to/some/script.sh 3')];.});...so it would run the first two at the same time and when they've both completed, run the next ones. in reality this is many levels deep. i'm looking to replace this with a blank version but am struggling to figure out which modules/packages to leverage to make it happen...searches have brought up numerous possible ways to do this in blank which is making it a bit tricky to suss out which one to go for. asyncio, subprocess, etc."
