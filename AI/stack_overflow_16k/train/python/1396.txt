"write each var input on a new line in a text file i would like to know how i can make this irc 'bot' log to a text file...i used:..  text_file = open(""log.txt"", ""w"").  text_file.write(ircmsg +""rn"").  text_file.close()...the problem is that this code will make new input overwrite the textfile, while i want every new input a new line in the same text file...(i know there are 'made bots' on the internet, but i prefer making it myself.)"
