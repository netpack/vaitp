"prevent user from entering the same input twice i am making a game similar to text twist on blank and i was wondering how to prevent the user being able to input the same word twice. here is what i have so far... ..import random.correct = 0.incorrect = 0.usedwords = [].print 'welcome to text twist, you have 14 guesses to get 7 words made up of 4, 5 or 6 letters. good luck!'..for i in range(14):.    print ""your letters are 'e' 'p' 'l' 'b' 'e' 'b', what is your guess?"".    answer = raw_input().    if answer in usedwords:.        print ""sorry, you've already used this word"".    if answer == 'belle' or answer == 'bleep' or answer == 'pebble' or answer == 'beep' or answer == 'bell' or answer == 'peel' or answer == 'peep':.        if answer in usedwords:.            print 'nice that was one of the words!'.        usedwords.append(answer).        correct = correct + 1.    if answer != 'belle' and answer != 'bleep' and answer != 'pebble' and answer != 'beep' and answer != 'bell' and answer != 'peel' and answer != 'peep':.        print 'sorry, that was not one of the words.'.        incorrect = incorrect + 1...print 'your final score was', correct, 'correct and', incorrect, 'wrong.'"
