"changing str to int in blank i am new to blank. i am trying to make a small elavator program...the code: ..import time.elavator = true.# 0 is b floor // basement.elavatorfloors = [0,1,2,3,4,5]..while elavator == true:.    getlevel = input (""which floor would you like to visit? ( 1 - 5) "").    time.sleep(2).    print ""you're now at floor, "" +int.getlevel...i get this error: attributeerror: type object 'int' has no attribute 'getlevel'.aside from changing the str to int, am i using any bad technique? i really want to improve my programming thinking and code writing. thank you :)"
