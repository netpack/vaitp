"using code to write a function that calculates values for projectile motion i have an assignment that asks me to use some given code to write a function which calculates the angle needed to hit a target 10 metres away. ..here is the given code: ..from visual import *.from visual.graph import * # for the graphing functions .#create a graph display window (gdisplay) ..win = gdisplay(xtitle=""distance [m]"", ytitle=""height [m]"") .#and a curve on this display ..poscurve = gcurve(gdisplay=win, color=color.cyan) .#target position (10 meters away) ..target_pos = vector(10,0,0) .#set the starting angle (in degrees) ..angle = 45 .#set the magnitude of the starting velocity (in m/s) ..v0 = 12.0 .#gravity vector (m/s**2) ..g = vector(0, -9.8, 0) .#create a vector for the projectile's velocity ..velocity = v0 * vector(cos(anglepi/180), sin(anglepi/180), 0) .#and the position ..position = vector(0,0,0) .dt = 0.01 # time step .#start loop. each time taking a small step in time ..while (position.y &gt; 0) or (velocity.y &gt; 0): # change in position # dx =          (dx/dt) * dt dx = velocity * dt .# change in velocity .# dv = (dv/dt) * dt .dv = g * dt ..# update the position and velocity .position = position + dx .velocity = velocity + dv ..# plot the current position .poscurve.plot(pos=position) .#when loop finishes, velocity.y must be &lt; 0, and position.y &lt; 0 ..print ""landed at x position: "", position.x print ""x distance to target: "",     position.x - target_pos.x...how would i now write a function to calculate the required value? i have no idea where to start, any help would be greatly appreciated! ..thanks"
