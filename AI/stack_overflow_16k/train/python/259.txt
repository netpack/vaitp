"dict-like collection for attributes is there a class in blank 2.7 that behaves like:..x = attrdict(foo=1, bar=2).x.foo  -&gt; 1.x.bar  -&gt; 2...for arbitrary attributes / constructor keywords? ...a dict is close, but doesn't have attribute access nor such a nice constructor syntax..a named tuple comes close too, but i don't want to create a new type for each combination of attributes....something like that would be handy to have sometimes. i could make one myself in a minute, but it sounds like something that might exist in blank already."
