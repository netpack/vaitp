"blank can't access second element in list indexerror: list index out of range i have a text file formatted like this:..jeff:2.bob:7.adam:4...i've read the data from the text file and created a list for each line. so that it looks like this when i run the program...[''].['jeff', '2'].['bob', '7'].['adam', '4']...however i want to assign a variable to the first and second elements in the lists so that i can sort the integers from highest to lowest but it keep getting an error, which i can't solve. ..here is my code: ..if choice == 1:.    f = open(""group1.txt"", 'r').    for line in f:.        line = line.strip(""n"").lstrip().rstrip().split("":"").        print(line).        name = line[0].        scores = int(line[1])..        print(scores)...it gives the error..scores = line[1].indexerror: list index out of range...i'm not sure why it doesn't work the number is the second element within the list ""line""..how can i fix this? thanks for any help in advance"
