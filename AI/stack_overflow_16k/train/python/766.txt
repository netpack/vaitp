"bodmas - blank i thought i understood bodmas (bidmas in the uk). i'm unsure why the following expression evaluates in a different order:..a = 8*4//3...i expected 'division' to take place first, giving a = 8*1  - instead 'multiplication' occurs first, giving a = 32//3 = 10..b = 9//3*7...example b evaluates to 21, as per bidmas rule...it seems that blank executes an expression from left to right and treats 'division' and 'multiplication' as equivalent. what's happening? thanks in advance, faz."
