"how can i block on readline() in blank so i don't have to poll? .  possible duplicate:.  tail -f in blank with no time.sleep  .....i am trying to monitor a log file that is being written to (like tail -f), and i can't figure out how to make readline() block once it reaches eof.  all of my googling has only turned up solutions to make things non-blocking.  does anyone know a way to make a call like this block, so i don't have to poll?  (i'm perfectly capable of polling and sleeping already, so if you suggest that i'm going to rate you down.)..fh = open('logfile').# i only want new output, so seek to the end of the file.fh.seek(-1,2).while true:.   # i want this to block until the file has new output, .   # but it sees eof and returns '' immediately.   line = fh.readline().   # ... process the line"
