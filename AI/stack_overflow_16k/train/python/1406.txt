"find the index of a dict within a list, by matching the dict's value i have a list of dicts:..list = [{'id':'1234','name':'jason'},.        {'id':'2345','name':'tom'},.        {'id':'3456','name':'art'}]...how can i efficiently find the index position [0],[1], or [2] by matching on name = 'tom'?..if this were a one-dimensional list i could do list.index() but i'm not sure how to proceed by searching the values of the dicts within the list."
