"blank's json.load weird behavior i'm trying to extract a specific value from log files in a directory..now the log files contains json data and i want to extract the value for the id field...json data look something like this..{.    id: ""123"",.    name: ""foo"".    description: ""bar baz"" .}...code looks like this..def test_load_json_directly(self):.    with open('source_data/testing123.json') as log_file:.        data = json.load(log_file).        print data..def test_load_json_from_iteration(self, dir_path, file_ext):.    path_name = os.path.join(dir_path, '*.' + file_ext)..    files = glob.glob(path_name).    for filename in files:.    with open(filename) as log_file:.        data = json.load(log_file).        print data...now i try to call the function test_load_json_directly the json string gets loaded correctly. no problem there. this is just to check the correct behavior of the json.load function...the issue is when i try to call the function test_load_json_from_iteration, the json string is not being recognized and returns an error...valueerror: no json object could be decoded...what am i doing wrong here?"
