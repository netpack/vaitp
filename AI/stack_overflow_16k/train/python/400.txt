"is there anyway to do a reverse index in blank ok i guess it did not make sense the first time i posted. but what i want to know if there is a method that does that does the opposite of what the indexing method does. for example lets say i input in blank shell >>> l = 'hello' i know that if i put in the index l[2] the result will be 'l'. but what i want to know if there is any simple method i could use that if i put in l['h'] it would return 0, the indexing value/ position in the string. i need it so that i can put it into a function."
