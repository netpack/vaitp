"multiple socket connections without re-opening a new socket each time i have a small web app that will invoke blank scripts each time a user clicks on a button...each time someone clicks the button, i open the socket connection, connect, do what i have to do and close the connection...after every socket connection, the telnet server generates a ton of events and there is no way for me to modify the telnet server...is there any way to have the button always connect to the same socket connection so that i don't have to see all those events generated? basically only see these events on the first connection. code is below. i was thinking of having a py script running in the background with an open connection and just have my code below connect to socket that py script is using in the background.. clientsocket = socket.socket(socket.af_inet, socket.sock_stream). clientsocket.connect((127.0.0.1, 11111)).. clientsocket.send('testrn'). connection = clientsocket.recv(buf).. close_connection(clientsocket,buf)"
