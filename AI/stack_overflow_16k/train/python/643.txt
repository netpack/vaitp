"is it okay to indent to preserve 79 char limit? suppose i have a long line of code:..scores_pre = pd.series([235.34, 928.23, 94.29, 943, 304, 405.45, 932.94, 823.45, 473.68, 382.48, 473.68, 382.48, 928.23, 94.29, 943, 304, 405.45])...to preserve a 79 char limit, i heard i should indent the line like this:..scores_pre = pd.series([235.34, 928.23, 94.29, 943, 304, 405.45, .                        823.45, 473.68, 382.48, 473.68, 382.48,.                        928.23, 94.29, 943, 304, 405.45])...however, given that indents in blank matter, i am worried this will have some side effect in my code. is this type of indenting okay? advisable?..(forgive the noob question)"
