store modules in project folder some times i need to use modules which are not a part of default blank installation and some times even packages like anaconda or canopy does not include them. so  every time i move my project to another machine or just reinstall blank i need to download them again. so my question is. is there a way to store necessory modules in the project folder and use them from it without moving to default blank installation folder.
