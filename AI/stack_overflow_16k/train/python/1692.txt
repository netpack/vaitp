"restart a for loop within a for loop i have two for loops...i want to iterate through the first for loop from top to bottom...i have a second for loop, within the first the for loop, that i want to restart each time it gets hit...within the second for loop, i have a break statement when i find what i need...however, my problem is, in the second for loop, everytime i break out, the next time it gets accessed, it always starts from the next position after the previous break...the second for loop never starts from the beginning of itself. only from when i previously utilized break, it starts from there."
