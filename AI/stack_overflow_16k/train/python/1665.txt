"how to count how many times the user has typed the wrong answer (blank) i am pretty new to blank, soo, yeah..basically i have this:..import time.import sys..def delay_print(s):.    for c in s:.        sys.stdout.write( '%s' % c ).        sys.stdout.flush().        time.sleep(0.10)..name=input(""what's your name?"").question1=input(""how many centimeters are one meter?"").if question1==""100"":.print(""correct!"").question2=input(""how many meters in a centimeter?"").if question2==""0.001"": .    print(""correct!"") .import os .time.sleep(1).os.system('cls') .time.sleep(1).delay_print(""calculating results..."").time.sleep(3).print(""good job,"", name, ""!"")...and i am asking questions: to be precise 2..so i want to keep track of how many times the user has got a question wrong so at the end i can display how many questions were right, and how many wrong..then i want to show a specific message:.for when all of them are right, the one that i have already typed..for when one is right and one wrong i want to type:.""not bad (name), but be more careful!"".and last but not least, when he/she gets it all wrong:.""oh man! that is very bad (name)! be more careful!"""
