"importerror: no module named, when module exists i have the following relevant libraries and files in my project:..project_library.    data.        some_folder.            sub_folder1.                script1.py.            sub_folder2.                script2.py..    scripts.        __init__.py.        lib_a.py...the code in script1.py works perfectly and looks a bit like this:..# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-.import sys.sys.path.insert(0, ""c:/project_library/scripts"") #...from lib_a import *.#some more irrelevant code here...the code in script2.py doesn't work, blank claims importerror: no module named lib_a while i actually copied and pasted the heading of script1.py:..# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-.import sys.sys.path.insert(0, ""c:/project_library/scripts"") #..print sys.path #looks good..from lib_a import * #crashes here.#again, more code...what possible reason can cause this?..edit:..a very interesting note. if i try to run script2.py after copying the file into sub_folder1 without changing a thing, it does work. then why doesn't it work in sub_folder2?..edit2:..i did get it to work, for some reason just creating a new file and copying and pasting the file's content into it just worked miraculously! i still kept the original file with the original file name, as it still doesn't work on it, very interesting. i wonder what the source of the problem could possibly be"
