"how would i be able remove punctuation then split that word into two? how would i be able to split a word containing punctuation into 2 separate words without punctuation? for example if i have the string ""half-attained"", how would i make it so that i can remove the ""-"" as well as splitting the words into ""half"" and ""attained""...this is what i have so far and it only removes the punctuation and puts the words together...for n in range(0,len(test_list)):.  no_punct = """".  for char in test_list[n]:.    if char not in punctuations:.        no_punct = no_punct + char.  no_puclist.append(no_punct)"
