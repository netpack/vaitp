"". press enter alone to abort: "").    while true:.        if inputfile != '':.            try:.                filetext = open(inputfile, ""r"").                filetext.close().            except ioerror:.                print(""error - that file does not exist. try again."").        elif inputfile == '':.            input(""nrun complete. press the enter key to exit."").        else:.            print(""nerror - invalid option. please select again."")   .    return inputfile"
