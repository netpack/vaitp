"looping through variables and testing for user input i want to write a program which asks the user questions and then checks for his answers. here it is displayed with 3 questions and 3 answers. i was able to write it for a single question-answer pair, but am having difficulties using the same piece of code for all the pairs - i don't want to use explicit code for each question-answer pair as it would generate lot's of code.i would appreciate help with making it work for all questions...q1 = ""question 1 is 30 fps more cinematic than 60 fps? - a)yes, b)no, c)it's a matter of opinion or d)nobody knows"".a1 = ""b"".q2 = ""question 2 test question? - a), b), c) or d)"".a2 = ""b"".q3 = ""question 3 if 10 + 9 is 19 what is 9 + 10? - a)19, b)20, c)21 or d)22"".a3 = ""c""    .def quiz():.    n = 0.    while n &lt; 3:.        n = n + 1..    if str(input(q1)) == a1:.        print(""correct answer"").    else:.        print(""wrong answer, correct answer is"", a1) ..print(quiz())"
