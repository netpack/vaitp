"how do you print a single copy of a string in a -while- loop? just starting blank and finally got to -while- loops..*went to if-else's, functions, and for/while loops only..how do you get this to print only itself?..def hangman(secret):.    tries = 5.    word = ''.    while tries &gt; 0:.        guess = raw_input(""guess a letter: "").        for index in secret:.            common = 0.            for char in guess:.                if char in index:.                    common = 1 """"""checks whether they have something in .                                  commmon"""""".            if common == 1 or index in "" .?!"": """"""checks if the secret_word .                                                 has the 4 characters"""""".                word = word + index """"""word is now the common letters"""""".            else:.                word = word + '-' """"""letters not in common are a dash"""""".        tries -= 1.        print 'you have', tries, 'tries left.'.        print word...&gt;&gt;&gt; hangman('hello').guess a letter: h.you have 4 tries left..h----.guess a letter: e.you have 3 tries left..h-----e---.guess a letter: l.you have 2 tries left..h-----e-----ll-.guess a letter: o.you have 1 tries left..h-----e-----ll-----o.guess a letter: a.you have 0 tries left..h-----e-----ll-----o-----...p.s i'm not sure if i even did the code correctly all i know is that it runs..    return ends the loop"
