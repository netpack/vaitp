"how to make the subprocess statment to execute under the os.walk(path) i want my script to go under a particular file path mentioned in os.walk() and then execute a grep command on all the files under that location and redirect the output to a file. below is the script i created, but the subprocess executes ls -al command under the current directory but the print statment show me the contents of os.walk. so i need the subprocess to execute the command under the os.walk path as well.      ..  with open('ipaddressifle.out', 'w') as outfile:.     for pdir, dir, files in os.walk(r'/users/skandasa/perforce/projects/releases/portal-7651'):.         for items in files:.             print(items).             #subprocess.call(['ls', '-al']).         process = subprocess.popen(['ls', '-al'], shell= true, stdout=outfile, stderr=outfile).         #process = subprocess.popen(['grep', 'portalshared','*', '|', 'awk', '-f', '[','{print', '$1}'], shell= true, stdout=outfile, stderr=outfile).         [output, err] = process.communicate()...and is there anyother way apart from adding a cd command to the subprocess call."
