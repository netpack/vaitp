"setting a set to the contents of a global set i'm making a program in which i use 6 global sets. inside of various functions that are called i make temporary backup of those sets by doing something like temp_set = set. when i do this, the temporary set is somehow modified when i changed the original set. i assume that blank is setting temp_set to a pointer to the original set here. how can i prevent it from doing this. rapid response would be immensely appreciated."
