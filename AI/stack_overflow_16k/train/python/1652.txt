"most blankic way to find which of a set of inputs, when fed to a function, produces the smallest output i have a list of objects object_list and a function func. i want to find which object produces the smallest output from func. currently my code looks like this:..minimum_object = object_list[0].minimum_value = func(object_list[0]).for object in object_list[1:]:.     val = func(object).     if val &lt; minimum_value:.         minimum_value = val.         minimum_object = object...is there a more blankic way to solve this problem? i feel like my solution is really verbose, for a problem that should be solved with one call to a magic high level function from itertools."
