"how do you specify a windows service in blank i am writing a script that starts and stops windows services in blank. so far i've set it to where i can turn on/off any listed service, but i am attempting to have a loop if the listed service is invalid. i created a text file with all listed services on my computer. i am attempting to have create check on whether or not its a real service. my syntax for start/stop services would be ..choice = input ("" would you like to start or stop a service : "")..if choice == ""stop"" :..    stopping = 1..   while stopping == 1:..       service_name = input (' which service would you like to stop : ')..        win32serviceutil.stopservice(service_name)..        print (""service is stopping"")..        text = "". . . . . . ""..        for char in text:..            sys.stdout.write(char)..            time.sleep(0.5)..        print ( ""service has stopped"" )..        break...and my attempt at a check would be ..servicelist = r""c:usersethanmdesktopblank text fileswindows .services list.txt ""..infile = open(servicelist, 'r')..line = infile.read()..servicelist = line.split()..print (servicelist)..serviceword = input (""enter a service"")..if serviceword in open (r""c:usersethanmdesktopblank text .fileswindows services list.txt "").read():..    print (""word found"")..else:..    print (""no word"")...whenever i use the check, it *technically * works, but if i type a character, it gets listed as correct because that character can be found in any of the services. an example would be ..enter a service : okay..word found ...and when i enter a normal character..enter a service : a..word found...i would like the script to be able to tell whether or not it is a valid service, only accepting valid service inputs. an example would be ..enter a service : spooler..word found..enter a service : anifd..no word..enter a service : aeiou ..no word..enter a service : shpamsvc..word found"
