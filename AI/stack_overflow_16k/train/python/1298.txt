"blank prime number code i am trying to generate the first ""n"" prime numbers after 3. issue is i do not understand where my code is going wrong and would appreciate if someone could help me with the logic...a = 3.b = 2..# n = number of prime numbers to be printed..n = 1000..for a in range(a, n):   #this i the range of all numbers to be tested.    if a % 2 == 0:      #only odd numbers are prime(except 2) so eliminate the evens.        print ""."".else:.    for b in range(b, a):  #this is to test the odd numbers.        if (a % b == 0):   #i am dividing  a by all numbers smaller than it to test.            print a, ""is not prime"".            break...any guidance on helping me solve this problem would be greatly appreciated. i read through the older posts on this question but wanted to see where specifically my own logic was flawed...thanks."
