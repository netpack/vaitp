"how to iterate through an enumerate object and print all the index-item pairs using next() function? i have the following program..enum1 = enumerate(""this is the test string"".split())...i need to iterate through enum1 and print all the index-item pairs by using next() function...i try to get the index-item pairs by doing the following..for i in range(len(enum1)):.    print enum1.next()...it throws me an error showing len() can't be applied to an enumeration...could anyone suggest me any such way by which i would be able to iterate through this enum to print all the index-item pairs using next() function?..note: my requirement is to use next() function to retrieve the index-item pairs"
