"joining two lists of lists by index i have two list of lists of the same length, something like the following...list1 = [[],[],[1,2,3,4],[],[2,5,6]].list2 = [[],[],[1,9,3,9],[],[1,8,6]]...i want to join these lists so that if there are values in the list it will be added to the same index in the list, eg [[],[],[1,2,3,4,9],[],[1,2,5,6,8]]. .i was trying to use map(list,zip(list1,list2)) but that merges both lists into a list giving for example two empty lists inside index[0]. instead of this i want to the values from both lists in index[0] added to index[0] and if there are no values in either list then this list should remain empty. what would be the best way to do this ?"
