"point wrapping algorithm - a blocked swinging door i'm trying to some some code in blank. basically what it does is simulates a door (viewed from above) on an (x,y) coordinate system. the task is given a list of points, determine which the door will hit first, if any...determining if a point is within range to be hit by the door is simple enough, determining which point gets hit first is proving to be difficult, as the door can swing clockwise or counter clockwise, and has a rather large, and variable range of swing (in terms of radians/degrees). the issue is mostly that i'm not sure what conditions need to be true for the point to be hit first...update:.i do have the angles calculated, but concerned about special cases such as when the door is at 1 degree, and swinging clockwise towards points at angles 180, 190, and 300 for example."
