"blank get week starting day from yearweek recently i was bothered with the function that would return starting day of the week for a given string concatenation of year and week and surprisingly couldn't find it anywhere. ..i saw similar ones (ie. question1, question2), but i am only given the year and week, without days...let's have an example input and a desired output:..func('202005') -&gt; monday 27.01.2020...i found a lot of counting, but not anything elegant, a smooth one-liner. is there any?"
