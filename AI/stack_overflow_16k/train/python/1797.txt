"how to put original caller on hold, make another call and then connect both together after some validations i have the following requirement and i am evaluating if it’s possible using twilio voice apis....caller dials twilio number and passes a unique id as dtmf codes..twilio api captures the callerid and dtmf codes..twilio calls another number and passes the dtmf codes....now, this another call (non-twilio number) can take 25-30 seconds. i need to pass dtmf code to this another call and verify the number etc..for this 25-30 seconds, i need to put the original caller on hold and need to play an instruction set or music(an mp3) while other call successfully validates dtmf..once other call successfully validates dtmf - i need to connect original caller with that call..there is no agent involved here. the only human is the original caller.....i am able to complete 3.1 but stuck for the past couple of days for step 3.2, please. it’s making me wonder if twilio supports this?..thanks in advance!"
