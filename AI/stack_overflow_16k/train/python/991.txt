"how can i add the attributes of 2 classes using method overloading? 1.i really have 2 questions. first i am getting unexpected output of ...  none none...from my last line of code...for the harder question i need to use method overloading to add the cost of these two item objects..i first prompt the user for item 1 asking for its name, price then quantity. i then multiply the price and the quantity to get that items total. ...i repeat this for the second item.i then want to display the two items and there separate total as well as the combined total. it should look like this..total cost.apple 3 @ $2 = $6.balls 4 @ $4 = $16..total: $22...i'm getting this instead..total cost..x 3 @ $2 = $6.y 6 @ $4 = $24.none none...i don't know where the ""none none"" is coming from or how to remove it without the item info getting removed and i don't know how to combine the cost using overloading. i have what looks like a solution in the add method here with my code..class item:.    def __init__(self, name = 'none', price = 0, quantity = 0):.        self.item_name = name.        self.item_price = price.        self.item_quantity = quantity.        self.total = price * quantity..    def __add__(self, other):.        return self.total + other.total...    def print_item_cost(self):.        return print('{} {} @ ${} = ${}'.format(self.item_name,.                                              self.item_price,.                                              self.item_quantity,.                                              self.total))..#grab first item.print('item 1').name_1 = input('enter the item name: ').price_1 = int(input('enter the item price: ')).qty_1 = int(input('enter the item quantity: ')).item_1 = item(name_1, price_1, qty_1)..#grab second item.print('nitem 2').name_2 = input('enter the item name: ').price_2 = int(input('enter the item price: ')).qty_2 = int(input('enter the item quantity: ')).item_2 = item(name_2, price_2, qty_2)...#output cost.print('nntotal cost').print(item_1.print_item_cost(), item_2.print_item_cost())"
