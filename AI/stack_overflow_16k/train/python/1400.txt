"print list of items line by line in a file is it possible to print the below result line by line?..i tried to add n on print(final n, file=f). but that's not working...here is the code:..def calcperm(arr, size):.    result = set([()]).    for dummy_idx in range(size):.        temp = set().        for dummy_lst in result:.            for dummy_outcome in arr:.                if dummy_outcome not in dummy_lst:.                    new_seq = list(dummy_lst).                    new_seq.append(dummy_outcome).                    temp.add(tuple(new_seq)).        result = temp.    return result..lst = [1, 2, 3, 4].seq = 3.final = calcperm(lst, seq).print(len(final)).with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:.    print(final, file=f)"
