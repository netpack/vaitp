"how to extract 1st, 2nd and last instance of a string from a given text file based on their ids? i have a text file with strings of the form below:..66_0m100.66_1m101.66_2m102.66_3m103.66_4m103.66_5m103.67_0m100.67_1m102.67_2m105.67_3m103.67_4m106...the number before ""m"" represents the number of instance. i have to extract the 1st, 2nd and last instances of each id (id is the first part of string, before underscore. here it is 66 and 67). also, if there is any id without at least 3 instances, that should be ignored...for example, the output for ids 66 and 67 would be:..66_0m100 (1st instance of 66).66_1m101 (2nd instance of 66).66_5m103 (last instance of 66).67_0m100 (1st instance of 67).67_1m102 (2nd instance of 67).67_4m106 (last instance of 67)...this output should be written to a new text file...i tried the following code, it is giving me the 1st and 2nd instances but i'm not able to extract the last instance. ..import numpy as np.from collections import defaultdict.data = defaultdict(list).for filename in [""list.txt""]:.    with open(filename,'r') as file1:.        for line in file1:.            col1,col2 = line.split(""_"").            for i in np.unique(col1):.                id1,id2 = col2.split(""m"").                if ((int(id1) == 0) or (int(id1) == 1)):.                    print(line)"
