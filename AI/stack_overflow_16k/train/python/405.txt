"what is ++ operator doing in blank? blank doesn't support c-style ++a increment but, to my surprise, it doesn't complain either leading to me being temporarily baffled as to why my loop wasn't working...trying a few things (having first initialised with a=0) i find that a++ and a-- produce a syntax error, but ++a doesn't. while --a produces a syntax error in blank 3.3 but not in blank 2.7...what's going on? why doesn't ++a give an error? why does --a not give an error in 2.7 but does give an error in 3.3?"
