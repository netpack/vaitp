"creating a json parsing function with blank i have been trying to create a function to use as an importable tool for parsing json. here is my code i have so far..#json parser.def jsonimporter(file_path , env_to_return):.    import json.    a = open(file_path,""r"") #opens and sets the file to read..    data = a.read()         #sets variable to read function.    print(data)..    json_data = json.loads(data) #loads the json data and stores it in json_data variable...    print(json_data).    json_data.get(env_to_return)..    return json_data...what my issue is, is that when i call the function in another file it does not display the parsed json it just displays the json as a a dict in this form;..{u'environments': [{u'dev': [u'111', u'222']}, {u'qa': [u'333', u'444']}, {u'prod': [u'555', u'666']}]}...the print statements you see are just me trying to double check my answers. .also i have passed the call the correct parameters as it prints out the parameters if i ask it too. thank you for your help!..dev = jsonimporter(""test2.json"",""dev"").# dosomething with value.print(value)...this is how i called the function"
