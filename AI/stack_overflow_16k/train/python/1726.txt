"how to execute my code block by block? i am new to blank, have some experience in matlab and r.  my question is: is it possible to run part of the code in .py block by block (line by line)? ..in r or matlab, i can first have some data and variables loaded in the memory first.  then experimentally i can run a line or two to try out the syntax... this is particularly useful for new learners i believe.  i know there is something called the iblank which can execute blank code line by line however this is not what i am after.  thanks."
