"what is the difference between these two pieces of code concerning lists nested inside dictionaries? i am learning blank by reading the 'blank crash course' book so i'm still a beginner, what i want to know is the difference between these two pieces of code as they both seem to be the same to me but give different results...names={.    'first' : ['john','mike'],.}.for name in names.keys():.    print(name[1])...this gives the result 'i'...names={.    'first' : ['john','mike'],.}.for name in names.keys():.    print(names[name][1])...this gives my expected result; 'mike'..any help would be appreciated."
