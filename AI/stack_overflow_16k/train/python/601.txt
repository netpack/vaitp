"an algorithm to create one list from ""x"" nested lists in blank what is the simplest way to create this list in blank?..first, suppose i have this nested list:..oldlist = [ [{'letter':'a'}], [{'letter':'b'}], [{'letter':'c'}] ]...i want a function to spit out:..newlist = [ {'letter':a}, {'letter':'b'}, {'letter':'c'} ]...well, this could be done manually. however, what if there are three nested? ...x nested..tricky? :)"
