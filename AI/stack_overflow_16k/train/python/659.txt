"blank working with files as they are written so i'm trying to create a little script to deal with some logs. i'm just learning blank, but know about loops and such in other languages. it seems that i don't understand quite how the loops work in blank.  ..i have a raw log from which i'm trying to isolate just the external ip addresses. an example line:...  05/09/2011 17:00:18   192.168.111.26  192.168.111.255 broadcast packet dropped    udp/netbios-ns  0   0   x0      0   0   n/a...and heres the code i have so far:..import os,glob,fileinput,re..def parseips():.    f = open(""126logs.txt"",'rb').    r = open(""rawips.txt"",'r+',os.o_nonblock)..    for line in f:.        rf = open(""rawips.txt"",'r+',os.o_nonblock).        ip = line.split()[3].        res=re.search('192.168.',ip).        if not res:.            rf.flush().            for line2 in rf:.                if ip not in line2:.                    r.write(ip+'n').                    print 'else write'.                else:.                    print ""no"".    f.close().    r.close().    rf.close()  ..parseips()...i have it parsing out the external ip's just fine. but, thinking like a ninja, i thought how cool would it be to handle dupes? the idea or thought process was that i can check the file that the ips are being written to against the current line for a match, and if there is a match, don't write. but this produces many more times the dupes than before :)  i could probably use something else, but i'm liking blank and it makes me look busy. ..thanks for any insider info."
