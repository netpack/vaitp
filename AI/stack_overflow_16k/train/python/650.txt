"convert and process a dictionary to matrix in blank i have a big list in blank like the following small example:..small example:..['gaattccttgaggcctaaatgcatcggggtgctctggttttgttgttgttatttctgaatgacatttactttggtgctctttattttgcgtatttaaaac', 'taagtccctaagcatatatataatcatgagtagttgtggggaaaataacaccattaaatgtaccaaaacaaaagaccgatcacaaacactgccgatgtttctctggcttaaattaaatgtatatacaacttatatgataaaatactgggc']...i want to make a new list in which every string will be converted to a new list and every list has some tuples. in fact i want to divide the length of each string by 10. the 1st tuple would be (1, 10) and the 2nd tuple would be (10, 20) until the end , depending on the length of the string. at the end, every string will be a list oftuples and finally i would have a list of lists..in the small example the 1st string has 100 characters and the 2nd string has 150 characters. .for example the expected output for the small example would be:..new_list = [[(1, 10), (10, 20), (20, 30), (30, 40), (40, 50), (50, 60), (60, 70), (70, 80), (80, 90), (90, 100)],  [(1, 10), (10, 20), (20, 30), (30, 40), (40, 50), (50, 60), (60, 70), (70, 80), (80, 90), (90, 100), (100, 110), (110, 120), (120, 130), (130, 140), (140, 150)]]...to make such list i made the following code but it does not return what i expect. do you know how to fix it?..mylist = [].valtup = list().for count, char in enumerate(mylist):.    if count % 10 == 0 and count &gt; 0:.        valtup.append(count).    else:.        new_list.append(tuple(valtup))"
