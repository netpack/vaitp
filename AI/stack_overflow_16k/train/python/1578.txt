"data analysis using blank--reading text file i have a text file structure like:..x   y   home.x   y   school...x and y are times and the last column is a location. how can i use blank to assess the x and y element where the 3rd column is home?..note: i have already opened the text file. if you feel i am asking to much, i would appreciate a link to a place that tells how to do something like this. also, x and y are not numbers they are strings: ex. 4:30 am"
