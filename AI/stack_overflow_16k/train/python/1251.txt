"input file comparison not working blank .why is the removal of the double quotes not working? (country = country[1:-1]).why is the first_list.append line not executing? i am looping through the lines of an input file and matching it against the first element of a list of lists stored in final_lists. when i print the output, even when the two values are in fact the same verified by the print statements (for example, when row[0]==zimbabwe and country==zimbabwe) the next append statement does not run......with open('world_bank_regions.tsv', 'ru') as f:.    next(f)..    for line in f:.         [region, subregion, country] = line.split('t')..        if country.startswith('""') and country.endswith('""'):.            country = country[1:-1]..        print country #the double quotes remain..        for row in final_list: #final list is a list of lists .            print row[0]    #row[0] == zimbabwe.            print country   #country == zimbabwe.            if row[0] == country:.                final_list.append([region, subregion])..    print final_list #no changes were made to the list from the previous steps"
