"using replace method in a loop in blank consider a text file and 2 lists. in list_a there are some letters and in list_b some other letters. i want an algorithm to find the letters in the text which exist in list_a, and replaces them with letters with the same index from list_b. it finds and replaces them, but, each time it replaces it the previous result disappears...i mean at last, i have the result of the last replacement in the print. how can i solve this problem? i mean i want a print in which all the letters are replaced, not just the last one..what could be the problem with this loop:..for i in text:.     if i in list_a:.         p=text.replace(i, list_b[list_a.index(i)]).print(p)"
