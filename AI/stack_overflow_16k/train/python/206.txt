"blank array indexing i am writing a code for doing some integration. but i am stuck at some point(the last two lines). as it says index error: index out of bounds. what i would like to do is- each time r has a value it should write to the empty corresponding index as an increment of 1 so that it can keep track of it. any help would be appreciated. here is the code-..from pylab import*.from math import*..dx = 981.dy = 1043.bx = 534.4.by = 109.5..index = zeros(shape=(1,dx+dy)).r=0.r_max=0..for i in xrange(1,dy+1):.    for j in xrange (1,dx+1):.        if i-by &gt; 0:.            theta = 180*atan(abs(j-bx)/(i-by))/pi.            if theta&lt;10:.                r = round(sqrt((j-bx)**2+(i-by)**2)).                if r&gt;0:.                    index[r]+=1"
