"why is the blank index function execution time faster than my own linear search function? i'm doing an experiment comparing the execution time of the index function and my own linear search function. to my understanding, blank implements a linear search algorithm for the index function so the execution time should be roughly the same, shouldn't it?..my own search function looks like this..def linearsearch (x,numlist,length):      .    n = 0.    for i in range(length):.            n = n + 1.            if numlist[i] == x:.                    return i, n.    return -1, n"
