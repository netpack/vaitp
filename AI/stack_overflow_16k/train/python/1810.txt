how can i have blank read a file from my directory and print the data in columns? for example.the data in my directory is a simple txt file formatted like this:..cat 123 123 123..rat 321 321 321..bat 123 123 123..how would i go about having blank read the txt file and specifically print columns 2 and 4?..the txt file is a large amount of data. by large i mean i can't format it by hand.
