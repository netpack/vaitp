"how do i format my user input as 1. ""integer"", 2. ""integer"" and not make the code run all over again? what my code does is that it runs the code all over again, and it should just ask the user to not type a string or such, only integers without running the code all over again. this is problematic because if the user would want to sort 50 integers and accidentally mistypes a string, then the user would have to start over again... ..i have tried several try and catch code but doesn't seem to work...list1 = []..def bubble_sort():.    numbers = input(""how many numbers do you want to sort: "").    try:.        values = int(numbers).        print(""nenter your values: "") .        for k in range (values):.            list1.append(int(input())).        print(""nunsorted list: "", list1).        for j in range(len(list1)-1,0,-1):.            for i in range(j):.                if list1[i] &gt; list1[i+1]:.                    list1[i], list1[i+1] = list1[i+1], list1[i].        print(""nsorted list: "", list1)..    except valueerror:.        print(""nthat's not an int!n"").        bubble_sort()...bubble_sort()"
