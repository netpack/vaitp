"check multiple keys in a dictionary for existence and value i would like to do something only if an object has two keys with given values:..tel = ....nam = ....for obj in listofobjs:.    for key, val in obj.items():.        if (key == 'tel' and val == tel) and .           (key == 'nam' and val == name):.            # do something......which won't work since key and value can't be two values at the same time."
