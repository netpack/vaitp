"blank - big-o of del my_list[:]? what is the big o of del my_list[:]? this command deletes all elements in the list. my understanding is that it will be o(n). n being the length of the list...therefore the big o of this code would be bigo(n^2), correct?..note this is not for school, but rather for my understanding while i practice for interviews...from copy import deepcopy.class solution:.    # @param a : list of integers.    # @return an integer.    def removeduplicates(self, a):.        copy_array = deepcopy(a).        del a[:]..        for j in copy_array:.            if j in a:.                pass.            else:.                a.append(j)..        return len(a)"
