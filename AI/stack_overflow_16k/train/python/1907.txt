"what is the difference between sys and os.sys what is the difference between sys and os.sys in blank? i have seen many projects using sys when they have imported os. when i tried dir(sys) and dir(os.sys) they had same functions and their output was same...i often see code using sys.exit like this, rather than using os.sys.exit, but both do the same thing...import os   .import sys    .sys.exit()"
