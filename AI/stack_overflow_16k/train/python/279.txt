"what does it mean that blank is stack based? i have read how cblank is stack based. what does it mean? when i use the dis module, i see operations like load_fast etc, where the values are placed on a stack. but i have read that all values in blank are objects and hence go in the heap. i guess i am confusing two different things here. i have also read that there is something called stackless blank. can someone clarify this?"
