"unzip vs explicit loop what's the difference between the two ways to unzip two zipped lists?..assert isinstance(x, list).assert isinstance(x[0], tuple).assert isinstance(x[0][0], list).assert isinstance(x[0][0][0], dict)..x_model = [].x_synth = [].for row in x:.    x_model.append(row[0]).    x_synth.append(row[1])...x_model is now a list of list of dict..x_model, x_synth, = zip(*x)...x_model is a tuple of list of dicts.shouldn't the results be the same?"
