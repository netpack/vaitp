"create groups using directory api in blank i'm trying to create groups and mailing lists using the directory api but it seems that there is something wrong. i'm using the code from blank quickstart and it works fine. but when i'm trying to change the scope to :https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member in order to create or access groups, i'm getting the following error:...  https://www.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1/users?customer=my_customer&amp;orderby=email&amp;alt=json&amp;maxresults=10 returned ""insufficient permission: request had insufficient authentication scopes."">...do you know how i can fix that?"
