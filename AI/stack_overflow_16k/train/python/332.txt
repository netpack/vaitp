"trouble calling the location for google chrome in code i'm trying to open the web browser, and one line of code is giving me problems..options.binary_location(""c:/users/calhoun/appdata/local/google/chrome"")..i've been eliminating my problems one by one on this site but i cant find a solution to this one. whenever i run the code, it says:..typeerror: 'str' object is not callable..no where in my code do i have str, so it's not a problem of me changing something. the full directory for chrome is ..c:userscalhounappdatalocalgooglechromeuser data..before it branches off into a bunch of folders...what can i do to make this error go away"
