"determining largest variable in blank i looked up similar questions, but most weren't in blank or were asking something a little different. ..i have 5 variables, each with a value. how do i determine which variable is the largest?..i've been using five loops of something like.   if (vara > varb and vara > varc and vara > vard and vara > vare).      vara is the largest..i think this is an obtuse way of doing it, however, and would appreciate any suggestions."
