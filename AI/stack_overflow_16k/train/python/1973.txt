"use blank software without blank interpreter installed on my system i'm new to blank and i'm trying to understand the basics things..before to install the blank interpreter on my computer i downloaded deluge (a torrent client written in blank) and it works without any issue, then i thought i must had blank running but if i run the command:..blank --version...i get the error saying that blank is not installed on my computer. how is it possible ? how is the code from deluge executed ?"
