"adding entries to datastructure are duplicated i'm trying to implement a r-tree datastructure and i have the following rnodeleaf class:..class rnodeleaf(object):.def __init__(self, entries=[]):.    self._entries = entries..def addentry(self, e):.    self._entries.append(e)...and i want to distribute some data to the nodes i created. consider this piece of code:..        nodes = [].        for i in range(8):..            if i % 4 == 0:.                node = rnodeleaf().                nodes.append(node).            node.addentry(5)..        print(nodes).        print(nodes[0]._entries).        print(nodes[1]._entries)...so my assumption would be that there were 2 rnodeleafs created which is true, as i printed print(nodes) and both of them have 4 elements..but then after i print print(nodes[x]._entries) i was surprised, because they both the same data...[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]...so what am i missing and what can be done to fix this error?"
