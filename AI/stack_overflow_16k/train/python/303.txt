"how to return two elements with same indexes from different tuples? the task says that i have to create a function with an input string. inside the function, i have two tuples. first - for names, second - for surnames if this string contains a name from the first tuple it has to return this name with a surname that has the same index. ..that's what i did:..def find_full_name(text):.    if not text or type(text) != str:.        return text.names = (""joe"", ""scott"", ""john"", ""stephen"").surnames = (""warren"", ""rixner"", ""greiner"", ""wong"").for name in names:.    if name in text:.        return name...my code only returns the name and i can't figure out how to return a surname too. i've been trying to compare indexes like names.index() == surnames.index() but i did not help."
