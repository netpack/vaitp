"why is my ""return"" outside the function? i've got a simple function here that just gives me a list of the square numbers up till a number that i choose. 3 in this example...def range_squared(n):..    """"""takes a non-negative integer value n and returns the list of the numbers, up to n-1 squared..    """""".a = [].for i in range(n):.    i = i ** 2    .    a.append(i)..return a..print (range_squared(3)).....it's still in the loop, i think, but i don't understand why. is it an indentation problem? i've tried putting space here and there, but with no luck. also, i'm not sure how to get rid of the ""undefined name 'n'"" in ""for i in range(n)"". am i supposed to change it to ""a""?"
