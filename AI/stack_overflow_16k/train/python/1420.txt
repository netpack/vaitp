"how to deal with many instance variables in blank? i am new to blank and to object-oriented programming. i have a basic question on oop using blank. suppose there is a class with some instance variables initialized. later on, i need to add many more instance variables. i can do that with object.attribute = value outside the class. the code in the class does not set the attributes/variables. ..will the program not become difficult to maintain when it grows large? there would be instance variable assignments strewn everywhere in the code except inside the class. isn't it a better idea to have those assignments in the class with self.attribute = value, where they can be tracked easily? what is the right approach?"
