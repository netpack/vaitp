folder layout created during blank installation in the main folder where blank is installed there are ..blank26.  -dlls.  -doc.  -include.  -lib.  -libs.  -scripts.  -tcl.  -tools...what is each of these supposed to be?  why is there libs and libs?  why do some things go in libsite-packages like django and others like sqlite3 in lib?  an explanation of how things are decided or a pointer to an article would be helpful if possible.
