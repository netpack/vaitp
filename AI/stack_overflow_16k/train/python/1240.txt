"randomly choosing a % of elements in a string and changing the value i have a sting and need to randomly replace 5% of the elements, and flip them to 0 if they are 1, and flip them to 1 if they are 0...i have a string that looks like this:..'10011110110001000111010011010100101100100110111000010001111100001010000011101100011110100110001110010101010000100111000101001100100110110010010100000010111110000011001001011011010111111010001011101011110100000101010110100001001011010000111110101011001101011000100100010010100011100001011011110001010101010101100001111111010101000010011010010110111100011111001011100101001000101011110000010111101111101100010010010011011101101110110000000000101010101010101011111011010111000101010010001010110011101011'...effectively, 5% of the values in the string will change from a 0 to 1, or vice versa...i have tried this but it does not seem to work, and isn't guaranteed to only replace 5% of the elements:..for i in range(500):.    if random.random() &lt; 0.05:.        if test[i] == '1':.            test[i] == '0'.        else:.            test[i] == '1'"
