"for ... in ... loop (blank) skips some values in list i'm given a practice to write a function in blank that takes a list as input which includes all integers ..i should remove all odd numbers and let even numbers stay and return the list ...this is my function :..def purify (lst):.    for key in lst:.        if key % 2:.            lst.remove(key).return lst...when i run it these are the results i get : (here are some test cases)...  print purify([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])...results :...  1.  3.  5.  7.  9.  [2,4,6,8]...another test case :.when i run using this line :...  print purify ([4,5,5,4,5,5])...results :...  4.  5.  4.  5.  [4,4,5,5]...i'm not sure what's happening , if i remove that ""if"" condition , then there is no problem (like this):..def purify (lst):.    for key in lst:.        print key.return lst...it prints all values in list and doesn't skip any..am i doing something wrong?"
