"how to correct this loop using an array if any keyword from an array is mentioned in the title, don't click the title. if the title doesn't mention any of the keywords click the title...right now it clicks all the time, and i know why but i don't know how to fix it. it always clicks because it goes through the whole array and eventually there is a keyword that is not in the title. ideas?..arr = [""bunny"", ""watch"", ""book""]..title = (""the book of coding. (e-book) by seb tota"").lower().length = len(arr).for i in range(0,length - 1):.    if arr[i] in title:.        print ""dont click"".    else:.        print ""click""...this should not click the title because arr[2] is in the title"
