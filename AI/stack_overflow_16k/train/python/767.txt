"how do i copy specific strings from a text file with blank? i am working in the field of astronomy, and the process that i use to unzip the images that i get from the telescopes can be very tedious. the format that the images come in is 'fits.fz' which stands for fits.fits-zipped. i want to decompress these into just '.fits'. i have already i'm working on a program that simplifies this process of decompressing. i have created a graphical interface with two buttons through blank and tkinter. the first button creates a text file named 'list.txt' and then executes a pre-existing .bat file which dumps the names of every file in a specific directory that ends with 'fits.fz' into 'list.txt'. the first button is also supposed to copy the specific names of the files into a very specific place in another bat file. the other .bat file is called 'decompress.bat' and is supposed to use the following command for each file in 'list.txt': .. c:ds9ds9.exe . c:directoryfits file here .-savefits...i would like for the blank program to be able to copy specific sections from a line of code and paste them where 'fits file here' is. ..the following is the function that is executed when the first button is pressed... f = open('c:/jah/list.txt'). f1 = open('c:/jah/decompress.bat', 'a').. def begin_wombocombo(): #is function for first button.     open('c:/jah/list.txt', 'w').close() #clears 'list.txt'.     open('c:/jah/decompress.bat', 'w').close() #clears 'decompress.bat'.     subprocess.call([r'c:/jah/newbat.bat']) #dumps directory into 'list.txt'..     doihavetocopytheline=false #bool for whether or not the program has to copy line.     for line in f.readlines(): #loops through all instances to find fz files and then pastes them into decompress.bat.       if 'fits.fz' in line:.         doihavetocopytheline=true.       if doihavetocopytheline:.         f1.write(line).     f1.close().     f.close()...the issue with this is that it only copies the lines of text that has the fits.fz files. this means that it copies everything else on the line such as when the file was created. is there any way to simply copy and paste the fits.fz file alone? how would i go about working these strings into the .bat file?..thank you for your time, and btw the second button just executes 'decompress.bat' which is the file with the commands to unzip the images."
