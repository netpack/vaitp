"hexagonal filling of 2d array i am trying to fill an array with unique integers (except for 0) in such a fashion:..# range(0, 37).[[ 0,  0,  0, 36, 19, 20, 21],. [ 0,  0, 35, 18,  7,  8, 22],. [ 0, 34, 17,  6,  1,  9, 23],. [33, 16,  5,  0,  2, 10, 24],. [32, 15,  4,  3, 11, 25,  0],. [31, 14, 13, 12, 26,  0,  0],. [30, 29, 28, 27,  0,  0,  0]]...(this represents hex grid as 2d array)..how to figure out the size of 2d array (width and height) before it is filled?.how to determine the coordinate at which the next integer should be placed?..thanks to @błotosmętek i am now able to figure out the size of the array:..def array_size(n):.    k = 0.    while n &gt; 0:.        k += 1.        n -= 6 * k.    return 2 * k + 1"
