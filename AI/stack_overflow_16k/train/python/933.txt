"create a list of list with flexible input (blank) i currently have a function that creates a list of lists like below using 3 nested for-loops...[[1,1,1] , [1,1,2] , .... , [3,3,3]]...however, the problem is i can't use this function if someone wants the list of list to be something like..[[1,1,1,1,1,1,1] , ..... , [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]]...which has more numbers (from 1 - 9) and more elements (7 of 1's instead of 4)...here's my current code:..def listoflist():.    temp = [].    for i in range(1,4):.        for j in range(1,4):.            for k in range(1,4):.                temp.append([i,j,k]).    return temp...can someone provide me with a better solution? i want my function listoflist() to be flexible where it could receive an input for both the size of the list of list and the elements inside the list."
