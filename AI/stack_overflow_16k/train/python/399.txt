"why it raises nameerror i have one problem with understanding object-oriented programming..why i got:...  nameerror: name 'coin' is not defined?...and could you please explain me how classes and objects work in this program. i don't understand why we should pass self parameter...import random  # the coin class simulates a coin that can  # be flipped..class coin():.    # the _ _init_ _ method initializes the  # _ _sideup data attribute with ‘heads’..    def __init__(self):.        self.__sideup = 'heads'..    # the toss method generates a random number.    # in the range of 0 through 1. if the number.    # is 0, then sideup is set to 'heads'. # otherwise, sideup is set to 'tails'..    def toss(self):.        if random.randint (0, 1) == 0:.            self.__sideup = 'heads'.        else:.            self.__sideup = 'tails'  # the get_sideup method returns the value  # referenced by sideup...    def get_sideup(self):.        return self.__sideup.        # the main function. 32..    def main():  # create an object from the coin class..        my_coin = coin()  # display the side of the coin that is facing up..        print ('this side is up:', my_coin.get_sideup ())  # toss the coin..        print ('i am going to toss the coin ten times:').        for count in range (10):.            my_coin.toss ().            print (my_coin.get_sideup ()).            # call the main function...    main ()"
