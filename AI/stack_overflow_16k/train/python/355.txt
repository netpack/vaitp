"class variable have different values for different instances i read somewhere that ""if blank can't find instance variable it will try to return value of the class variable having the same name""..eg..class sample:.    pi = 10...now..x1 = sample().x2 = sample()..x1.pi         # returns 10.x2.pi         # returns 10..x1.pi = 20    # change the value of class variable.x1.pi         # return 20 (ok).x2.pi         # still returns 10 :(.sample.pi     # returns 10 :(...what is happening??"
