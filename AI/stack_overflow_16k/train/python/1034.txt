"blank: how to set up configuration variables of program? i'm writing a script that takes a directory as input. this directory will be used by many different functions which read data from the disk. currently, the directory name is stored in a variable, which is passed through to each function or class that uses it:..data_dir = get_data_dir().spam = calculate_spam(foo, bar, data_directory=data_dir).eggs = calculate_eggs(spam, baz, data_directory=data_dir)...unfortunately, the function signatures and function calls get quite long, which makes the code unnecessarily hard to read and therefore error-prone. is there a better (i.e. blankic) way handling configuration parameters like this?"
