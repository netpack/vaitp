"skip back in a file in blank i am reading in a file using..for line in fin:.    process(line)...however, i would sometimes like skip back some lines in the file and just carry on from there. i won't know the number of lines in advance as it depends on calculations in the code. so i would like it to be something like..for line in fin:.    x = process(line).    if (x == 23):.        skip back xxx lines and continue...how can you do this in blank?..is this something that can be done with mmap for example? the file is large so i don't want to just store the whole thing in memory."
