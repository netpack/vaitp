"why is my segno vcard qr code causing unfortunately dialer has stopped error when adding its details to contacts? i have created a vcard qr code with the segno library, when i add 2 fields namely (organization and title) to the helpers.make_vcard tuple that takes the vcard details the generated qr code does not save the details to the mobile phone after scanning when a user clicks add to contacts, i only get a message that says “unfortunately dialer has stopped” but without these 2 fields (organization and title) the details are added correctly. what could be causing this? how can i fix it?..i have tried scanning with variable mobile phones thinking it is a compatibility issue but nothing is happening. when i remove the fields the details get saved upon scanning, when add them the vcard details dont get saved...from segno import helpers.from pil import image.import datetime..qr=helpers.make_vcard(name='surname;name', displayname='name surname',.org='place of work', title='position',.phone=('71******', '77******'),email=('******@gmail.com'),.url=['http://********.com'], pobox='po box ***********', city='g*****').qr.save('person.png', scale=15, background='white', color='black')...i expect that after reading the qr code when it says add to contacts all the necessary fields in the mobile phone should be porpulated by the details in the vcard."
