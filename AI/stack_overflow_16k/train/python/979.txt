"blank compression function which returns 32 digit string? i am using the md5 function to hash a string into a 32 digit string...str_to_encode = 'this is a test string which i want to encode'.encoded = hashlib.md5(str_to_encode).hexdigest() ...i want to be able to decode this string (i.e. encoded in the example above) back to its original value.  i don't think this is possible using md5 (but if it is please let me know), but is there a compressionn function which i can use which will give me a 32 digit string at the end but which can be reverted?..edit:.the string being encoded is a url so will only be a couple of hundred characters max although in most cases it will be a lot less. ..thanks"
