"blank requests - not able to get fresh response each time from cgi script i'm trying to write a blank script that gets name popularity data from https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/index.html. there's a cgi script /cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi that returns the output in table format, based on two request parameters, year (or yob) and top (top 10, 20 etc.). i need to be able to aggregate results for different years by passing request urls for different years but with the same top value, say, 10. but the page does not refresh for different request urls, e.g. the response pages for https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi?yob=2000&amp;top=10 and https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi?yob=2004&amp;top=10 are the same...&gt;&gt;&gt; query_url = 'https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi'.&gt;&gt;&gt; results_page_04 = requests.get(query_url, params={'year': 2004, 'top': 10}, headers={'cache-control': 'no-cache, no. ...: -store, must-revalidate'}).text.&gt;&gt;&gt; results_page_00 = requests.get(query_url, params={'year': 2000, 'top': 10}, headers={'cache-control': 'no-cache, no. ...: -store, must-revalidate'}).text...these two responses are exactly the same, and the responses are actually for the year 2015, which is strange...is there some header i have to set before sending off the request (i'm using the requests library)."
