"in blank function how to pass an optional argument to be filtered how can i pass in an optional argument to user-defined function whereas when the argument is called, it filters the original data and when it’s omitted, original data is not filtered..import spacy.from collections import counter.nlp = spacy.load('en').txt=“””though the disease was eradicated decades ago, national security experts fear that stocks of the virus in labs could be released as a bioweapon.”””.doc = nlp(txt)..def common_pos(doc, n, pos):.  words =  [token.lemma_ for token in doc if token.is_stop != true and token.is_punct != true and token.pos_ == pos].  word_freq = counter(words).  common_words =word_freq.most_common(n).  print(common_words)...here pos is the optional argument. the desired behaviour is that if i don’t pass in pos, it shows the most common words, whereas if i pass ‘verb’ as pos, it shows the most common verb...how could i make this an optional argument? thanks"
