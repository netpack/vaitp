"sequence switch in blank i am solving a problem in blank. ..the general idea is that given a sequence of numbers, then pick out the numbers form this sequence according to a rule, then this pick-out numbers form a new list...step1, pick out the numbers in odd position (the position count from zero) and append to a new list. ..step2, the remaining numbers form a new sequence...step3, in the next round, pick out the numbers in even position of the new sequence, and append to a new list...step4,  after this round, the remaining numbers forms a a new sequences. ..repeat this procedure until all the number in the original sequence have been pick out to for a new list. ..for example, given a sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], ..step1, pick out the numbers in odd position, new_list = [1, 3, 5, 7] ..step2, the remaining numbers form a new sequence is [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]..step3, pick out the numbers in even position of the new sequence, then the numbers [0, 4, 8] are picked out from the new sequence, and append to new list. then  new_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 4, 8] ..step4, the remaining numbers form a new sequence is [2, 6]..repeat step 1, then 6 is picked out append to  new_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 4, 8, 6] .repeat step 2, then 2 is picked out append to new_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 4, 8, 6, 2], then all numbers in original list are picked out. and the final result is the new_list...i do not know how to implement it in blank. i got stuck in the first step, i want to use a for loop over the sequence and pick out the numbers according to odd or even index. but after picking out the numbers, the sequence changes. then i have to start over a new for loop to loop over this new sequence, if the original sequence is very long. i will be too long and inefficient coding. could someone gives me idea how to deal with this problem?"
