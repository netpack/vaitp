"blank - how to compare two files and output only the different lines in a third file i have searched for similar questions on so but didn't find anything that worked for me.  ..i have two large files, they should be the same but one of the files is 60 lines longer than the other. i want to know what these lines are and where i can find them.   ..i've read that one can use difflib to do this but i can't figure out how to go about it. i always get + and - in the file but i don't want that. i just want to scan through both files and report the uncommon 60 lines into a third file. ..i wrote this code but it does not print out the different lines...f1 = open('file1.txt','r').f2 = open('file2.txt','r').f3 = open('file3.txt','w')..diff = set(f1).difference(f2).same.discard('n')..for line in same:.    f3.write(line)"
