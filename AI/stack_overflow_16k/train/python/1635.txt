"running executable from blank with keyboard input i am calling a command line executable from blank:..import subprocess.import os..def genparfiles(program):.    path = ""c:/00working/99cygwinbin/""..    def exe_call(program):.        fullpath = path + program.        subprocess.call(fullpath)..    exe_call(program)...if __name__=='__main__':.    main()...this works fine. the exe runs in the interpreter window...now, the program that i'm calling is waiting for me to press enter to start calculating, which i can do in the interpreter window with no problem...my question is, how can i automate the 'enter' so i don't have to press it manually?"
