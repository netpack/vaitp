"giving a randomly chosen variable from a list a certain string value so i'm currently making a tic tack toe game where you play against the computer, and i can't seem to figure this part out.  i want the computer to select a random variable from a list of positions that haven't been used yet, and make that variable's value o.  here is what i have currently.  ..#positions is a list of variables that start off = ''..positions = [ul, uc, ur, cl, cc, cr, ll, lc, lr]..comchoice = randrange(0, len(positions))..while positions[comchoice] != '':.    comchoice = randrange(0, len(positions)).else:.    positions[comchoice] = 'o'...edit: this question is different than the one that it is said to be a duplicate of.  it is different because it is asking about changing the value of a variable in a list.  it's clear in my post that i understood the duplicate post's question with my code."
