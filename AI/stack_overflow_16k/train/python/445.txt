"how to create a chunked list of tuples of size 500 and then add data to it? this is my code, using blank 2.7..list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10.....1000]...i'm trying to create chunks of 500 list data like this..chunk_data = [(1,2,3,4,5,...500),(501,502....1000)]...and then i'm going to add a ""data"" at the end of each chunk..so it will look like this..[(1,2...500,'data'),(501,502...1000,'data')]...i tried to use zip for this..it = iter(list1)    .chunked_data = zip(*[it]*500) ...but i'm unable to append the ""data"" now..from itertools import repeat.chunked_data = zip(*[it]*500,repeat(""data"")) #gives error about adding arguments after unpacking function values !!...it's not possible for me to write this code below even though it would work..chunked_data = zip(it,it,it...(500 times),repeat(""data"")]...so how should i attempt this?"
