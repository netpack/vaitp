"creating a function that counts words and characters (including punctuation, but excluding white space) i need to make a function which counts number of characters (including punctuation and excluding white space) and words in a given phrase. i've created a function so far that can count the number of characters ,but it includes white space as well and does not count words. how can i exclude whitespace and implement counting words as well?..text = "" if i compare myself to someone else, then i am playing a game .i will never win. "".def count_chars_words(txt):.    chars = len(txt.replace(' ','')).    words = len(txt.split(' ')).    return [words,chars]..print(count_chars_words(text))...output [19, 63]"
