"list object not callable i have an assignment to create a slot machine. i'm trying to write the loop that will spin the machine, but it keeps saying my list isn't callable...here's where i am having the issue:..wheel1 = ['candy','ghost','pumpkin','cat','zombie','witch','witch','cat','ghost','candy'].wheel2 = ['candy','ghost','pumpkin','cat','zombie','witch','cat','pumpkin','ghost','candy'].wheel3 = ['candy','ghost','pumpkin','cat','zombie','witch','pumpkin','candy','candy','ghost']..#loop to spin.i = 0..while i &lt; 500:.    spin1 = random.randint(0,9).    spin2 = random.randint(0,9).    spin3 = random.randint(0,9).    print(str[wheel1(spin1)]).    i += 1...i figured maybe the brackets were in the wrong space, but if i place them anywhere else i get a syntax error."
