"blank - blankpath on linux i'm novice in this, and i have started learning blank, but i have some questions that i'm not be able to understand,...what exactly is the blankpath (on ubuntu)? is it a folder?.is blank provided by default on ubuntu, or does it have to be installed explicitly?.where is the folder in which all modules are (i have a lot folders called blank_)?.if i wish a new module to work when i'm programming (such as pyopengl) where should i go to introduce all the folders i've got in the folder downloaded?.coming back from the blankpath issue, how do i configure the blankpath in order to start working on my new module?"
