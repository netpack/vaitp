"blank random number generator program not printing results i made a small program that is designed to generate a random number between 0 and 1, and based on what it is print out a statement (in this case ""missed"", ""1 point"" or ""3 points"") as well as the number that was actually made. the program generates the numbers fine, but i can't get it to print out the statements, is there something i overlooked here?..def zerog():. from random import *. n=random(). #print n. if(0&gt;=n&gt;0.3):.   print(""miss""). elif(0.3&gt;=n&gt;0.7):.   print(""1 point""). elif(0.7&gt;=n&gt;=1):.   print(""3 points""). print n"
