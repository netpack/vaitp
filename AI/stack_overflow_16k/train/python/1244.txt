blank: creating variable name from header row in csv read i have looked for the answered questions but my case is different...i am reading a large csv file with a header row and has 50 names in the header corresponding to 50 data columns in csv file. i want to create 50 arrays and each array will store data as i proceed to read and parse the file line by line. i want to store the 50 arrays in variable names same as the column name read the header line.
