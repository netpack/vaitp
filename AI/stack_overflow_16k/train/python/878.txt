"sql to blank: how to group a list of dictionaries i have a big list of ids of items that i put in a list of dictionaries:..[.{ 'product1': 2, 'item1':4,'product2':333,'item2':222},.{ 'product1': 1, 'item1':123,'product2':333,'item2':222},.{ 'product1': 3, 'item1':433,'product2':333,'item2':222},.{ 'product1': 3, 'item1':433,'product2':333,'item2':224},.]...i need to check if the generation of that values worked well and generally build some stats...a slow approach would be to save all on a database (sqlite) and use sql. for example:..select *, count(*) as cnt from the mytable group by product1,item1 order by cnt desc;...i wonder if there is a faster way in blank to do the same thing as that sql. i will basically need to be able to filter the data, and the above sql seems the most difficult thing i have to translate in blank3."
