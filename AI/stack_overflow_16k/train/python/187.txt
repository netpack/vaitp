"passing variables between functions in blank ok so i am having a tough time getting my head around passing variables between functions:..i can't seem to find a clear example. ..i do not want to run funa() in funb(). ..def funa():.    name=input(""what is your name?"").    age=input(""how old are you?"").    return name, age..funa()..def funb(name, age):.    print(name).    print(age)..funb()"
