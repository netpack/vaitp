"call one blank script from inside the other script i have 2 blank scripts, first script runs like this on windows: ..%blank script1 -d dir1...second script runs like this: ..%blank script2 -d dir1. both are working fine. instead of running both sequentially i want that script1 at the end call script2....note: in script1 i parse dir1 as sys.argv[2].i used like this at the end of the script1 :..os.system(""c:iblankiblankipy.exe script2 -d sys.argv[2]"")...it failed because treated sys.argv[2] literally.when i replaced sys.argv[2] for hard-coded dir1 it worked correctly..the error i've got:..windowserror: [errno 2] [errno 3] could not find a part of the path 'n:scriptsdeletemesys.argv[2]'...my 2 questions:...how could i fix it?.how could i replace hard-coded path to 'iblank' to something more appropriate?...thanks"
