"how to define a temporary variable in blank? does blank have a ""temporary"" or ""very local"" variable facility?  i am looking for a one-liner and i want to keep my variable space tidy...i would like to do something like this:.....a, b, and c populated as lists earlier in code....using ix=getindex(): print(a[ix],b[ix],c[ix])....now ix is no longer defined......the variable ix would be undefined outside of the one line...perhaps this pseudo-code is more clear:.....a and b are populated lists earlier in code....{ix=getindex(); answer = f(a[ix]) + g(b[ix])}...where ix does not exist outside of the bracket."
