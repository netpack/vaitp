"how to check if a range of numbers supplied exist in a list? - blank i have a rather cumbersome line of code:..s=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]..if 1 in s or 2 in s or 3 in s or 4 in s or 5 in s or 6 in s or 7 in s or 8 in s or 9 in s:.    print(""yes, a number between 1-9 exists in list s)...is there a better way than this? i want to check if any number exists between [1-9] within list s."
