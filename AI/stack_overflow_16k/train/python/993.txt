"calculate a win percentage where a user inputs two pokemon names and it calculates their past fights i have this code where cokemon is a merged table of pokemon and combats. the table shows pokemon number, name, first pokemon number, second pokemon number, and winner.  first and second pokemon are referring to the pokemon in that battle, and winner is who won. : ..i have tried many different ways to get this to run, for loops, where loops and filters.  i think the problem is with my syntax.  ..my_data= cokemon[cokemon['first_pokemon']== cokemon['winner']].numeratorcount = my_data.groupby(['name']).count()['#'].tolist()...bottom= cokemon['first_pokemon'] != cokemon['winner'].bottom = cokemon[bottom].denomcount= bottom.groupby(['name']).count()['#'].tolist()..win_percentage = numeratorcount/denomcount...i would like to be able to input two pokemon names and have it calculate the win percentage based on previous fights between the two pokemon. i keep getting various error messages ranging from invalid syntax to variable names being undefined."
