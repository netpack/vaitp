is it safe to replace '==' with 'is' to compare boolean-values i did several boolean comparisons:..&gt;&gt;&gt; (true or false) is true.true.&gt;&gt;&gt; (true or false) == true.true...it sounds like == and is are interchangeable for boolean-values...sometimes it's more clear to use is..i want to know that: ..are true and false pre-allocated in blank?..is bool(var) always return the same true(or false) with the pre-allocated true(or false)?..is it safe to replace == with is to compare boolean-values?....it's not about best-practice...i just want to know the truth.
