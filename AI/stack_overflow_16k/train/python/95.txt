"blank - install modules from source i downloaded a repo from github and installed it in a virtualenv using $blank setup.py install in the project dir...this works fine. now, when i open a file and induce an error, (like changing return to lol) it still installs fine. what is going on ? i wished to assert that my changes do not break the module and was hoping to install each time i make a change."
