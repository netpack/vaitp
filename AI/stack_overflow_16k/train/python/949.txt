"what's actually happening when i convert an int to a string? i understand it's easy to convert an int to a string by using the built-in method str(). however, what's actually happening? i understand it may point to the .   __str__ method of the int object but how does it then compute the “informal” string representation? tried looking at the source and didn't find a lead; any help appreciated."
