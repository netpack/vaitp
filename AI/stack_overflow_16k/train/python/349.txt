"in blank, how can i read just the first x lines from a file using the ""strip() for line in file"" format? see code below where i try to use 2 different functions to read different parts from a text file (essentially a save file for a game board). the first one tries to read the first 5 lines and assign them to a matrix (list of lists). the second one tries to read the 6th line and assign it to a string. however i can't seem to get the code to work. any ideas?..def load_board():.    with open(""savefile.txt"",""r"") as savefile:.        loadboard = [line.strip().split("","") for line in savefile].        return loadboard..def load_side():.    with open(""savefile.txt"",""r"") as savefile:.        loadboard = [line.strip() for line in savefile].        loadside = loadboard.pop().        return loadside...savefile.txt looks like this:..r,r,r,m,r.r,r,r,r,-.r,r,m,r,r.r,r,r,r,r.m,r,r,r,r.m"
