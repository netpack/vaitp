"modifying code to default to option instead of asking user for selection? i am not very experienced with blank, just trying to make a modification to the code of a program i purchased. ..the code runs in the command terminal and its function is to gather data. it gives you the option of gathering the data in either csv or json. it prompts you once with asking which format and a second time for confirmation...please enter output format (csv/json)  .do you want to extract data in {} format? (y/n)...i am trying to change this to just do csv by default, and not be prompted for either choosing or confirming..i believe the relevant code from the program is the following ( this isn't all consecutive ). how do i alter the first part to just be 'csv' and do i need to do anything beyond deleting the entire def getconfirmmessage block to wipe that from the code?..if spidertoexecute in range(1, 7):.    while true:.        outputformat    = click.prompt('please enter output format (csv/json)', default='csv').        outputformat    = ''.join(outputformat).lower().        if outputformat in ['json', 'csv']:.            break...settings.set('feed_format', outputformat).settings.set('feed_uri', './data/{}.{}'.format(spiderconf['log_output_name_format'], outputformat)).settings.set('log_file', './log/{}.log'.format(spiderconf['log_output_name_format']))....def getconfirmmessage(spidertoexecute, outputformat):.confirmmessages = {.    1: 'do you want to extract data from in {} format ?'.format(outputformat),.    2: 'do you want to extract data from in {} format ?'.format(outputformat),.}..return confirmmessages[spidertoexecute]...edit: more code..    if not click.confirm(getconfirmmessage(spidertoexecute, outputformat), default=true):.        click.echo().        click.secho(' please relaunch the command to select new options! ', bg='red').        click.echo().        raise click.abort()"
