"iterating over file object in blank does not work, but readlines() does but is inefficient in the following code, if i use: ..for line in fin:...it only executes for 'a'..but if i use:..wordlist = fin.readlines().for line in wordlist:...then it executes for a thru z...but readlines() reads the whole file at once, which i don't want...how to avoid this?..def avoids():.    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.    num_words = {}..    fin = open('words.txt')..    for char in alphabet:.      num_words[char] = 0.      for line in fin:.        not_found = true.        word = line.strip().        if word.lower().find(char.lower()) != -1:.          num_words[char] += 1.    fin.close().    return num_words"
