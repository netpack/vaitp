"apply multiple ranges to one list i am trying to loop through a long list of data which needs to be sorted by range, and then i need to count the integers in each range. the following code works if you continually input the range i.e. 0-101, 100-201, 200-301, etc. .is there a way to write this code so that i do not have to input each range? ..import collections .first_range = [ ] .f = open(""numbers.txt"").count1 = collections.counter().for line in f:.    for number in line.split():.        count1.update((number,)).        if number &gt; '0' and number &lt; '101':.            first_range.append(number).print(len(first_range))...example data from number.txt:.[209, 166, 38] ..expected output:.0-101 = x.100-201 = y .etc."
