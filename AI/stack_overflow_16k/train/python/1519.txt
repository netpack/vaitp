"how do you repeatedly add a specific value to a variable in a loop? i'm trying to write a program where i am adding 0.165 to the variable weight. i am trying to repeat this 15 times. however, it is crucial that weight is constantly being added to 0.165 15 times, e.g. 13.365, 13.53, 13.495, etc. ..how would i accomplish this? sorry, i am kind of new to this whole blank coding, so please point out any excess mistakes from my code...   weight=int(input(""enter your weight"")).   newweight=weight+1.   othernewweight=newweight*0.165.   count=['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15'].   for x in range(0,15):.       print(""year"", count+0"", ""othernewweight+0.65"")"
