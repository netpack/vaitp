"blank formatted output as float of empty string aa = ''..out_str = '%6.0f' % aa..print out_str...is there a way to print an empty string with the formatting shown above? the reason why i need this is because the variable aa can sometimes store an actual float and other times it will be empty. but i do need to output it in the specified format. float(aa) does not work on an empty string...edit:..how about the following?..aa = ''.ab = 23..out_str = '%6.0f%6.0f' % (aa,ab)..print out_str...edit:.in above example,.aa = '', ab=23 would have to print six spaces, followed by 23 with four leading spaces"
