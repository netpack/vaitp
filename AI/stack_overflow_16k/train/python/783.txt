"the first while loop iterates, but does not change the value inside of the second loop i am trying to use a nested loop in order to delete certain lines from a .tsv file that i have. the lines that i want to delete all start with md# and i am trying to iterate the number using a while loop...the first time that the number is used 'md1' all 10 of the lines that contain that as the first string on the line are removed, however afterwards md2, md3, etc are not...as i am still a bit rusty with blank i had set up a very crude if statement in order to remove the lines, this worked although it is not the prettiest code in the world...included is an example of what the data looks like, 4 columns wide, 320 rows..[['md1', 'liverpool', 'draw', 'norwich'],.
