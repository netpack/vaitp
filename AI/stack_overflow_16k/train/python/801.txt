"blank can't find module ""site"" i'm currently trying to run a game which seems to need blank2.2. when i start the game nothing happens, so i brought back my very basic debugging skills and found out that the code calls a function called ""initializeex"" with ""site"" as parameter, then fails with ""error_file_not_found (00000002)"" and exits. i googled and it seems like site is a module of blank. ..the problem is i have never had any contact with blank and all this modules-stuff. i think i even have multiple versions of blank installed on my pc (just downloaded 2.2). can i somehow just download this library and install it?..i'm using windows 10 proffesional x64...ps: i wasn't really sure if i should post this to stackoverflow or superuser. so if you are a moderator feel free to move this to the right place :)"
