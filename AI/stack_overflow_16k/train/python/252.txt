"using function names as variables in blank i had an interesting (potentially stupid) idea: what happens if i use a built-in function name as a variable to assign some object (say integer). here's what i tried:.. &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]. &gt;&gt;&gt; len(a). 4. &gt;&gt;&gt; len = 1. &gt;&gt;&gt; len(a). traceback (most recent call last):.   file ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in ?. typeerror: 'int' object is not callable...seems like blank does not treat function and variable names differently. without restarting the blank interpreter, is there a way to assign len back to the function? or undo the assignment len = 1?"
