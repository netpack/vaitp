"blank: maths quiz- data not being stored my task is to create a quiz for primary school children. the quiz bit works fine. but i must time how long the child takes and store their 'username' 'correctanswers' and 'timetaken' into a .txt file for the specific class the child is in. to do that i ask the child their class number and store their information into the file that was specifically made for that class..the problems i in counter are: ..the time isnt being rounded even though i have timetaken = round(etime)in my code  ..raw_input not being defined (i have no idea how else to define it)..the message ""sorry, we can not save your data as the class you entered is not valid."" comes up even when a valid class number has been entered...ive searched everywhere but with no luck. any help at all would be greatly appreciated...import time.import random.import math..def test():.    num1=random.randint(1, 10).    num2=random.randint(1, num1)..    ops = ['+','-','*'].    operation = random.choice(ops)..    num3=int(eval(str(num1) + operation + str(num2)))..    print (""what is {} {} {}?"".format(num1, operation, num2)).    useranswer= int(input(""your answer:"")).    if useranswer != num3:.        print (""incorrect. the right answer is {}"".format(num3)).        return false.    else:.        print(""correct"").        return true..username=input(""what is your name?"").print (""welcome {} to the arithmetic quiz"".format(username)).usersclass = input(""which class are you in? (1,2 or 3)"").raw_input(""press enter to start..."").start = time.time().correctanswers=0.for question_number in range(10):.    if test():.        correctanswers +=1..print(""{}: you got {} answers correct"".format(username, correctanswers)).end = time.time().etime = end - start.timetaken = round(etime).print (""you completed the quiz in {} seconds"".format(timetaken)).if usersclass == 1:.    with open(""class1.txt"",""a+"") as f:.        f.write(""{}:scored {} in {} seconds"".format(username,correctanswers,timetaken))..elif usersclass == 2:.    with open(""class2.txt"",""a+"") as f:.        f.write(""{}:scored {} in {} seconds"".format(username,correctanswers,timetaken))..elif usersclass == 3:.    with open(""class3.txt"",""a+"") as f:.        f.write(""{}:scored {} in {} seconds"".format(username,correctanswers,timetaken)).else:.    print(""sorry, we can not save your data as the class you entered is not valid."")"
