"flow of execution in blank i'm completely new to blank and thus a bit confused about the flow of a program in blank..if my understanding is correct, for a single .py file, if we add the line..if __name__ ==""__main__"": main()...the interpreter finds the main function and starts executing from there..this, since blank execution goes sequentially line after line...my question is if there are multiple .py files and 1 such file has the main function, like java/c++ is there a way the blank interpreter can know ad start executing the main function?"
