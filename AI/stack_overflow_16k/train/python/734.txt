"the limit of characters blank could hold in memory i'm working on a blank project that uses txt files. it reads a few very long text files (a few thousands of lines - but could me more that that - that are utf-8 encoded) into a list, manipulates them quite a lot, and then writes them back to a file...i was wondering if this is the correct way to do such a thing. that is, is the limit of texts that blank could hold in memory reachable with this amount of texts? should i take reaching the limit into account (and if so, how do i take it into account)?"
