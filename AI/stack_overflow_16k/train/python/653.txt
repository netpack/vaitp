"using several methods inside class currently if i input x = matrix([[5, 4], [3, 8]]) it is calling __str__. how do i get it to call another method with this input? ..class matrix(object):.    def __init__(self, matrix = 0):.        self.matrix = matrix..    def __matrix__(self):.        return 10..    def __str__(self):.        return ""\n"".join([""\t"".join.                       ([""%d"" % k for k in row]) for row in self.matrix])...if my input is x = matrix([[5, 4], [3, 8]]) how do i tell the program to call the method __matrix__? it is currently calling __str__. ..i tried to make a method ""matrix"" inside the class ""matrix"", but the program didn't change, it keeps using the __str__ method."
