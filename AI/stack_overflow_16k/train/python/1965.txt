"sorting integers and strings in a single line code so i have the following list which represents students and their grades:..a = [('tim jones', 58), ('anna smith', 64), ('barry thomas', 80), ('tim smith', 80), ('yulia smith', 66)] ...i need to define a function to sort the students by their grades in descending order then surnames and lastly their forenames. with the following line of code it all works fine:..def sortstudents(a):.    return sorted(a, key=lambda x : (-x[1], x[0]))...but now i also need to make sure it works with grades as strings instead of integers and the above function fails the tests. i figured that the "" - "" is causing problems so i tried:..return (sorted(a, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]), reverse=true))...but it reverses the whole lists and it's not working as intended, even though it passes the string test...what i think i need to do is check if the grade is integer and if it is - execute the first version of the code, and if not - execute something else, which i still haven't figured out...anyone has any ideas?"
