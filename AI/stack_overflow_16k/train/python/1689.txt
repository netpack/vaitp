"how to properly solve modulenotfounderror i know that this question has been asked several times, but i am surprised by the fact that the most upvoted answers around this issue suggest the configuration of blankpath which is a very bad practise. ..assuming that i have a project with the following structure:..project/component_1/.project/component_2/.project/component_1/src/my_code.py.project/component_2/module_1.py...now, say i want to import function foo from project/component_2/module_1.py in project/component_1/src/my_code.py. ideally (for example on pycharm i can do this but i understand that behind the scenes it sets blankpath) i would like to do ..from component_2.module_1 import foo...however, if i run the blank code from my command line, i will get the following error: ..modulenotfounderror: no module named 'component_2'...what is the ideal solution to this problem? .modifying blankpath is not an option for me as it is too dirty."
