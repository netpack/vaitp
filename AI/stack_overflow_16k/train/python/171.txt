"blank, variable or list in list trying to figure out the best way to write this in blank.  i understand why my code isn't working, just not sure on the proper way to fix it.  if the ver has more then one, the test will fail b/c it isn't split into single vars.  ..i want to have a program print out the following based on flags:  all, open (only if lvl matches), closed (only if lvl matches), na (only if all lvls are na)..this is what i have so far:..#!/usr/bin/blank..import getopt, sys..flago=''  #show open tickets.flagl=''  #show out of lvl tickets.flagc=''  #show closed tickets.flaga=''  #show all.fname=''..options, remainder = getopt.gnu_getopt(sys.argv[1:], 'olca')..for opt, arg in options:.    if opt in ('-o'):.        flago = true.    elif opt in ('-l'):.        flagl = true.    elif opt == '-c':.        flagc = true.    elif opt == '-a':.        flaga = true.#    fname = remainder[0]..#only show tickets if lvl matches regardless of status.reqlvls = (""lvl1"", ""lvl2"", ""lvl3"" )..#loop through a file with following variables.# number, status(open/closed), lvl#,  comments.file = open ('test.conf').for line in file:.  fields = line.strip().split("":"").  num=fields[0].  stat=fields[1].  ver=fields[2].  comm=fields[3]..  #print all.  if flaga:.      print num, stat, ver, comm.  #show open .  elif flago:.      # ver is messing up if it is set to ver:[lvl1, lvl3].      # need to iterate check open and iterate over ver.      if stat == ""open"" and ver in reqlvls:.          print num, stat, ver, comm.  #show na.  elif flagl:.      if ver not in reqlvls:.          print num, stat, ver, comm.  #hide if not reqlvl.  elif flagc:.      if stat  == ""closed"" and ver in reqlvls:.          print num, stat, ver, comm...here is the test file:$ cat test.conf:..10:open:lvl1:""should show w/ -o"".11:open:lvl5:""should not show w/ -o, na b/c of lvl"".12:open:lvl3, lvl5:""should w/ -o, req lvl &gt; na lvl"".13:open:lvl1, lvl3:""should w/ -o"".14:open:lvl4, lvl5:""should not w/ -o na b/c of lvl"".20:closed:lvl2:""should show closed"".21:closed:lvl5:""should not show w/ -c, na b/c of lvl"".22:closed:lvl3, lvl5:""should w/ -c, req lvl &gt; na lvl"".23:closed:lvl1, lvl3:""should w/ -c"".24:closed:lvl4, lvl5:""should not w/ -c na b/c of lvl""...here is output:$ .../test.py -a.10 open lvl1 ""should show w/ -o"".11 open lvl5 ""should not show w/ -o, na b/c of lvl"".12 open lvl3, lvl5 ""should w/ -o, req lvl &gt; na lvl"".13 open lvl1, lvl3 ""should w/ -o"".14 open lvl4, lvl5 ""should not w/ -o na b/c of lvl"".20 closed lvl2 ""should show closed"".21 closed lvl5 ""should not show w/ -c, na b/c of lvl"".22 closed lvl3, lvl5 ""should w/ -c, req lvl &gt; na lvl"".23 closed lvl1, lvl3 ""should w/ -c"".24 closed lvl4, lvl5 ""should not w/ -c na b/c of lvl""..$ ./test.py -o #should show 10,12,13.10 open lvl1 ""should show w/ -o""..$ ./test.py -c  #should show 20,22,23.20 closed lvl2 ""should show closed""..$ ./test.py -l  #should show 11,14,21,24.11 open lvl5 ""should not show w/ -o, na b/c of lvl"".12 open lvl3, lvl5 ""should w/ -o, req lvl &gt; na lvl"".13 open lvl1, lvl3 ""should w/ -o"".14 open lvl4, lvl5 ""should not w/ -o na b/c of lvl"".21 closed lvl5 ""should not show w/ -c, na b/c of lvl"".22 closed lvl3, lvl5 ""should w/ -c, req lvl &gt; na lvl"".23 closed lvl1, lvl3 ""should w/ -c"".24 closed lvl4, lvl5 ""should not w/ -c na b/c of lvl""...i have tried using a function like this listed from :..def checkreq(ver):.   for s in  reqlvls:.     for item in ver:.       if item in s:.            print 'lvl: ', s.            return s...then changing:..  elif flago:.      if stat == ""open"" and checkreq(ver):...but that doesn't work right either...got the function from.check if list item contains items from another list"
