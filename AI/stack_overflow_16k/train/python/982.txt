updating a module level shared dictionary a module level dictionary 'd' and is accessed by different threads/requests in a django web application. i need to update 'd' every minute with a new data and the process takes about 5 seconds. ..what could be best solution where i want the users to get either the old value or the new value of d and nothing in between. ..i can think of a solution where a temp dictionary is constructed with a new data and assigned to 'd' but not sure how this works!..appreciate your ideas...thanks
