"what is the logic of reverse indexed slices in blank? reverse indexing in blank with the x[::-1] format is very handy, but what is the logic of reversed indexing on slices?  i understand that the idea is [high:low:-stride], but i find the following example confusing.  in particular, why is it not possible to slice so that the entire iterable is reversed (without using the implicit [high::-1] format)?..this blank 3.6 snippet:..s = 'abcde'.for i in reversed(range(0,6)):.    print(i, f'{s[6:(i - 1):-1]:&gt;6}', f'{s[:i]:6}')...returns:..5        abcde.4      e abcd.3     ed abc.2    edc ab.1   edcb a.0...concretely, why isn't the 0 line edcba?"
