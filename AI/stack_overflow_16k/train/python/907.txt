"blank give option if user inputs string i'm using blank 2.6.6..i have this code:..height = 20.width = 10.x = input('please insert a number between ' + str(width + 1) + ' and ' + str(height) + ': ').while x &lt; (width + 1) or x &gt; 20:.     print 'that option is not valid'.     x = input('please insert a number between ' + str(width + 1) + ' and ' + str(height) + ': ')...if the user only inputs number, everything works ok but if the user makes a mistake and type, for example q, it gives : ...  nameerror: name 'q' is not defined...i want, if the user inserts a string, the while loop kicks in and give the user: that option is not valid.....how can i solve this without using raw_input since width and height i want to treat tham as numbers?..regards,..favolas..edit .following daniel suggestion, i've modified my code to this:..height = 20.width = 10.x = raw_input('please insert a number between ' + str(width + 1) + ' and ' + str(height) + ': ').x = int(x).while x &lt; (width + 1) or x &gt; 20:.    print 'that option is not valid'.    x = raw_input('please insert a number between ' + str(width + 1) + ' and ' + str(height) + ': ').    x = int(x)...if the user only inputs int code works as planned but its not safe from user errors. if the users, makes a mistake and types 'q' it gives this error:..valueerror: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'q'...i understand why but how do i solve this?..regards,..favolas"
