"why is the byte size different for a variable that contains 1472 byte of a file if i have a file say a img, and i try to divide the file into 14xx byte chunks by reading 1 byte at a time through a generator and join them together in a variable, why is the resulting variable not 14xx byte? is it because of the internal handling of the variable in blank? if so what are some possible way to test if i actually have a 14xx data besides having my create_data function return another indicator?..def split_file(self, filename):.    with open(filename, ""rb"") as f:.        while true:.            byte = f.read(1).            if not byte:.                break.            yield(byte)...def create_data(self):.    for x in range (1, 1472):.        next_byte = split_file.filename..        if not next_byte :.            break.        else: .            msg = msg + split_file(self.filename).    return msg..curr_data = self.create_data.    while sys.getsizeof(curr_data) == 1472: .        # do something with curr_data...thanks in advance"
