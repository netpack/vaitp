"how to find and replace a certain part of a file? i have a master file that's incredibly massive, and parts of it need to be extracted so they can be edited. (think 100k+ lines here.) i have a script already to take parts out of the file, say i have ..module 1.  module a.    module aa.    module bb.  module b.    module cc.    module dd...and i run the script and remove a, i get..module a.  module aa.  module bb...i want to know how i can add module a and all it's submodules back to the file after i make changes to it. ..similar to this: blank replace section of text with only knowing the begining and last word except how to add text back in at that point."
