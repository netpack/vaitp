"easiest way to replace a substring what would be the easiest way to replace a substring within a string when i don't know the exact substring i am looking for and only know the delimiting strings?  for example, if i have the following:..mystr = 'wordone wordtwo ""in quotes"".""another word""'...i basically want to delete the first quoted words (including the quotes) and the period (.) following so the resulting string is:..'wordone wordtwo ""another word""'...basically i want to delete the first quoted words and the quotes and the following period."
