"creating an empty list, adding points to it in a function, but error when trying to call it back i am trying to use a list that i created in a previous function. the list is a set of times (each second is a point) and i need to add points every 1/20th of a second. the list of times was created in a previous function, but when i try to call back the list to np.linspace it, i get a typeerror code saying the global name list1 was not defined. ..i've already tried renaming the list to something different like time = [], but this does not help. i've also defined the empty list in the function and outside of the function...def time_finder():.    v = 0.    u = 0.    list1 = [].    while v &lt; 286:.        v = v + 1.        u = u + 1.        z = mce_data[0].        y = [a for b in z for a in b].        x = (y)[u].        w = np.array(x)[0].        x.tolist().        list1.append(w).    return (list1).    #print(list1).time_finder()..#adds 1/20th second marks.def twentieth_second():.    u = 0.    while u &lt; 286:.        v = 1.        timea = list1[u].        timeb = list1[v].        np.linspace(timea, timeb, parts+19).        u = u + 1.        v = v + 1.    print list1.twentieth_second()...the error that i get is nameerror: global name 'list1' is not defined. this error changes depending on the troubleshooting that i do. sometimes i get a call back error and other times i get an index is out of range error. i'm expecting to get a new list printed with the 1/20 second intervals included."
