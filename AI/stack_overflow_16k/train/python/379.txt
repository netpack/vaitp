"migrating from blank 2.4 to blank 2.6 i'm migrating a legacy codebase at work from blank 2.4 to blank 2.6. this is being done as part of a push to remove the 'legacy' tag and make a maintainable, extensible foundation for active development, so i'm getting a chance to ""do things right"", including refactoring to use new 2.6 features if that leads to cleaner, more robust code. (i'm already in raptures over the 'with' statement :)). any good tips for the migration? best practices, design patterns, etc? i'm mostly a ruby programmer; i've learnt some blank 2.4 while working with this code but know nothing about modern blank design principles, so feel free to suggest things that you might think are obvious."
