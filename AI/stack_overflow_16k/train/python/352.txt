"validating correct spelling of user input in blank how would a computer program deal with user misspelling of words in such a way that forces them to reenter until it is correct? e.g. entering male and female for a gender argument.  i'm using this blank code:..def mean(values):..    length = len(values)..    total_sum = 0.    for i in range(length):.        total_sum += values[i]..    total_sum = sum (values).    average = total_sum*1.0/length.    return average..name = "" "".age = "" "".gender = "" "".people = [].ages = [].while  name != """":..### this is the raw data input portion and the ablity to stop the program    and exit.    name = input(""enter a name or type done:"").    if name == 'done' : break.    age = int(input('how old are they?'))..  gender = input(""what is their gender male or female?"")...### this is where i use .append to create the entry of the list     .people.append(name).people.append(age).ages.append(age).people.append(gender).### print(""list of people:"", people)..#### useing the . count to call how many  m of f they are in the list ..print (""count for males is : "", people.count('male')).print (""count for females is : "", people.count('female'))..### print(""there ages are"",ages)..### this is where i put the code to find the average age..x= (ages)..n = mean(x)..print (""the average age is:"", n)...i would like to also force an age in the 18-25 range."
