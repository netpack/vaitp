"overwrite global var in one line in blank? i know that i can write:..foo = 'bar'.def update_foo():.  global foo.  foo = 'baz'...but do i really need two lines of code there? blank, alas, won't allow me to say..global foo = 'baz'...i could also mash the two lines together with the unfortunately repetitive..global foo; foo = 'baz'...any other shortcuts? i'm on blank 2.6.5, but i'd be curious to hear responses for blank 3 as well."
