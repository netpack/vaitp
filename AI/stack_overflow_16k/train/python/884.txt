"is there a way to get both the prediction probabilities for each class along with the labels for each class in a decision tree classifier? i want to get the prediction probabilities for each class along with the class labels for a decision tree classifier...probs = clf.predict_proba(test). ..this give me the probabilities and i want to sort to get the top 3 so the code below would give me that:..best_n = np.argsort(probs, axis=1)[-n:]..but i am unaware how to incorporate the clf.classes_ along with this to get it all together?"
