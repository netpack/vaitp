"project euler in blank (#53) so i'm learning blank so i'm going through some project euler problems. and i'm not sure if this is a blank problem i'm having, or just me being retarded, but i seem to be getting the wrong answer for problem 53. here's a link to the problem http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=53..and this is my code:....from math import factorial..def ncr(n,r):.    return (factorial(n)/(factorial(r)*factorial(n-r)))..i = 0..for x in range(1,100):.    for y in range(0,x):.        if(ncr(x,y) > 1000000):.            i=i+1..print i....i'm getting 3982 which is apparently the wrong answer. is something wrong that i'm doing that's specific to blank?"
