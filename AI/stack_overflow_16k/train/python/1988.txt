"truncating a int evening all, ..i am curious as how you would ""cut"" an integer down. .for example: ..num = 12345678 .num_shrunk = ""for example 3""(num).print(num_shrunk).123...i am aware of the round function however i need to be precise. i have tried format(num, ""3d"") however that is for decimal places. i also can't say only print num[0:3] as it isn't an integer. ..is there a simple way here of doing this that i am clearly not seeing?"
