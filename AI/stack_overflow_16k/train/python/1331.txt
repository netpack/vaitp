"join lines together in file that end with '' i am really new to blank and for some reason this has stumped me for a while so i figured i'd ask for help...i am working on a blank script that would allow me read in my files but then if there is a '' at the end of the line it would join the line after it...so if the lines are as follows:..: student 1 .: student 2 .student 3...any line that doesn't have the colon before it and if the previous line has the '' i want to combine them to look like this:..: student 2 student 3...here is what i tried:..s = """"    .if line.endswith('\'): .   s.join(line) ## line being the line read from the file...any help in the righ direction would be great"
