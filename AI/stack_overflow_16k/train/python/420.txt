"move all blank packages to new computer (same versions) i need to mirror all my blank settings and modules on computer a vs computer b...i could list all packages/modules in computer a using pip list and then install them on computer b one by one - but there are literally ~ 100s of packages...is there a better/quicker way to achieve this?..in addition:..1) when overwriting previous installations, for example, do i have to use pip install --force-reinstall ""pandas==0.23.0""?..2) is there a way to exclude selected packages (some personal, redundant modules)?..both machines are windows and run the same blank version."
