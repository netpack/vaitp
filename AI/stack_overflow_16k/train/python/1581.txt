"blank pygame music load from text file i've made a music player that uses a list with the name of my songs but it is really annoying so i made a text file with the name of every song in it..i convert the text to a list, and then i try to load the first song but it just won't load. .this is my code:..songpath = '/home/pi/desktop/muziek/'.f = open(songpath + 'songs.txt').song = f.readlines().print(songpath + song[0]).print('music player(alpha2.2)').import pygame.from time import sleep.sorted(song).currentsong = 0.state = 'playing'.pygame.mixer.init().pygame.mixer.music.load(songpath + song[0]).pygame.mixer.music.play().print(""songs:"").for i in range(0, len(song)):.    print(i+1, song[i]).print('nstarted auto play on:n' + song[currentsong]).......there is more code  but it is irrelevant for this question..but when i load it up it says:../home/pi/desktop/muziek/toto-afrika.mp3.music player(alpha2.3).traceback (most recent call last):.    file ""/home/pi/abc.py"", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;.        pygame.mixer.music.load(songpath + song[0]).pygame.error:.couldn't open '/home/pi/desktop/muziek/toto-africa.mp3'...btw the picture didn't upload so i typed it."
