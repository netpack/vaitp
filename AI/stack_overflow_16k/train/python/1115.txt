"how to have a sequence variable within a for loop         def main():..            for row in range (7):.                assignment = int(1).                if row == 1:.                    for assignment_number in range(0,8):.                        assignment_number+1..                for i in range(0,7):.                    assignment_mark = float(input((""please enter your mark for assginment"" assignment_number,"": ""))..                    assignment_weight = float(input(""please enter the total weight percentage for the assignment: ""))..            main()...so this is my code above, ..i'm basically trying to work out how i could say for each input variable ""please enter your mark for assignment x (from 1 up to 7). ..which will loop, so once they enter it for assignment 1, it then asks the same question for assignment 2...i hope this makes some sense. i'm new to programming in general and this just happens to also be my first post on stack! be gentle (: .thanks!"
