"what happens when i pass a totally different argument name in a function? let's say i have this function:..def print_a_line(line_count, f):.    print line_count, f.readline()...i call it by:..current_line = 3.print_a_line(current_line, current_file)...what happens now? line_count = 3 or  will it be line_count= current_line = 3?..also, is it a bad thing if i pass different argument names(like i did here with current_line instead of line_count?)"
