"recursive method to zip list? i have got a nested list of list that looks like the following,..list1 = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]...however, i would like to find out a method to concatenate the first index of each list with the first index of the other list. ..list1 = [[1,4,7,10],[2,5,8,11],[3,6,9,12]]...i have tried doing list comprehension by using the following code..list1 = [[list1[j][i] for j in range(len(list1)) ] for i in range(len(list1[0])) ]..# gives me.# list1 = [[1,4,7,10],[2,5,8,11],[3,6,9,12]]...however, i was hoping alternative methods to achieve the same results, hopefully something that is simpler and more elegant...thanks in advance."
