"blank change function input name internaly i need to create a function which can:...inspect input arguments and get the number of inputs and their values.create a loop, and add string '_in' after each input name .make the new inputs global.assign new inputs with old values ...i tried to use inspect.getargspec() but it seems like this should be called outside the function. so any suggestions?..here is the pseudo code:.define this function:..def set_global(a1, a2, a3, .... an):.    #the number of arguments is not fixed and we need to detect that.    for old_input in total input:.         new_input_name=str(old_input.name)+'_in'.         global new_input_name .         new_input_name = old_input.value"
