"finding if the list contains any integers in blank i'm very new to blank and am trying to build a function that would tell me if a given list contains any integers. something like:..def function(a_list):.    if a_list ????has_integers????:.       return ""yes"".    else:.       return ""do something""...i can't figure out how i can get a function to iterate on each element in the list to see if its an integer or not. any help would be appreciated...many thanks!"
