"create seperate data frames and plots with a for loop i'm trying to automate pivot table creation so i can make multiple pivot tables at once. i would also like to graph these with a sns.heatmap() plot...the code i have so far technically works but i'm forced to use a print command so the data doesn't come out in a data frame and the graph the is produced is extremely unreadable. ..for i in list(df): .y = pd.pivot_table(df, index = df[i], values=vector).print(y)...this doesn't give the desired result of an individual data frame for each loop of the loop...if i graph this with the code:..for i in list(df): .y = pd.pivot_table(df, index = df[i], values=vector).sns.heatmap(y, annot=true)...i get all the tables mushed into one long one with a n different heat map legends. ..i've tried using dictionaries to get around this but i don't think this is the best approach (but what do i know?)..d={}.for i in list(df): .    d[i] = pd.pivot_table(df, index = df[i], values=vector)       ...any one have any tips?"
