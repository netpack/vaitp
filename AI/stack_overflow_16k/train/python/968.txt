"error changing directory in blank i need to change directory to my local working directory in windows and then open a file for processing...its just a 3 lines code, as below:..import csv.import os.os.chdir('d:projectsinitiativesmachine learningprogramsassertion')...the error is as follows:...  windowserror: [error 123] the filename, directory name, or volume.  label syntax is incorrect: 'd:projectsinitiativesmachine.  learningprogramsx07ssertion'...notice x07 character that has replaced character x07...i have a similar code but that goes through fine:..import csv.import os.os.chdir('d:projectsinitiativesmachine learningprograms')..with open('example.csv') as csvfile:.    readcsv = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')...the only difference is directory assertion in the problematic code...i have tried single quoting, double quoting etc. for the chdir directive but nothing helps. i have also tried escaping as assertion but that is not the issue"
