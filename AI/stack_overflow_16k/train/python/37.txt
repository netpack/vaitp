"quiz gives wrong answer even though i answered correctly blank i'm quite the noobie when it comes to  blank programming. however i need as soon as possible a quiz making program which gives me % score at the end. here's what i've done so far:..#coding: utf-8..from random import shuffle..qas = [.('kvarts', 'sio2'),.('gull', 'au'),.('s√∏lv', 'ag'),.('kobber', 'cu'),.('platina', 'pt'),.('grafitt', 'c'),.('diamant', 'c'),.]..shuffle(qas).numright = 0..for question, rightanswer in qas:.answer = raw_input(question + ' ').if answer.lower( ) == rightanswer:.print 'correct'.numright +=1.else:.print 'wrong, the correct answer is ' + rightanswer.print 'you got %d and %d wrong.' % (numright, len(qas) - numright)...i get the program to work slightly but even though i answer correctly it still gives me wrong answer like this:..diamant c.wrong, the correct answer is c.kvarts sio2.wrong, the correct answer is sio2...i don't know what to do to fix this."
