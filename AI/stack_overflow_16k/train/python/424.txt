"turtle boxes repeating i asked a question about this same code a yesterday, and now i have another question. the code is supposed to create 500 randomly colored boxes individually.  instead, it draws each box in the same location. this is the code:..import turtle.from random import randint.colors = ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple', 'blue', 'orange'].window = turtle.screen().window.title('500 boxes')..for x in range(500):.    box = turtle.turtle().    box.color(colors[randint(0, 5)]).    for x in range(4):.        box.forward(30).        box.left(90)..window.exitonclick()...i want to make each box a new variable, but i am not sure how..i want each box to be 5 pixels away from each other box..thanks"
