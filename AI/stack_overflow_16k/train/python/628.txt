(i am using blank 3.5.1)..my aim is to convert string into hex value pairs...string = b'3f8ccccd'.hexpairs = binascii.unhexlify(string)...the value for hexpairs i get is this:..b'?x8cxccxcd'...what is the significance of the ? character? i would have expected the output to have been:..b'x3fx8cxccxcd'"
