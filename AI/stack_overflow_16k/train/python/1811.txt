"why isn't method formatting blank dictionary key indenting? for some reason method formatting a dictionary key only begins to indent after specifying a width greater than 4. any idea why? ..for i in range(10):.    print({'{0:&gt;{1}}'.format('test',i):12}, ""should be indented"", i)...output:..{'test': 12} should be indented 0.{'test': 12} should be indented 1.{'test': 12} should be indented 2.{'test': 12} should be indented 3.{'test': 12} should be indented 4.{' test': 12} should be indented 5.{'  test': 12} should be indented 6.{'   test': 12} should be indented 7.{'    test': 12} should be indented 8.{'     test': 12} should be indented 9...also, when i try to output a dictionary with indented keys to a text document the indent isn't consistent. for example, when i specify a constant indentation width of 10 characters, the indentation is not consistent across the output."
