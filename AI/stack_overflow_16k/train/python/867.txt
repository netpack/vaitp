"remove leading whitespaces from a html file in blank i need to do some replaces in a html file at the ""text"" level, that is, i cannot use a html parser because i'm not working with tags...for example, i need to replace var hls = new hls(config); with ..            var config = {.                xhrsetup: function(xhr, url){.                    xhr.withcredentials = true;.                }.            }.            var hls = new hls(config);...i'm finding that the replace function, when matching multiline strings like &lt;/script&gt;n&lt;/body&gt; takes into consideration the whitespaces, so for example to add something before the &lt;/script&gt;..    &lt;/script&gt;.  &lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;...i need to replace('&lt;/script&gt;n  &lt;/body&gt;', 'alert(1);n&lt;/script&gt;n&lt;/body&gt;')...as i'll be working with different files, some may be indented using 2 chars, others 4... i'm interested in removing all the leading whitespaces, so that the previous snippets become:..var config = {.xhrsetup: function(xhr, url){.xhr.withcredentials = true;.}.}.var hls = new hls(config);...or ..&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;...so that then, independently of the file, i could replace('&lt;/script&gt;n&lt;/body&gt;', 'alert(1);n&lt;/script&gt;n&lt;/body&gt;')..i tried to use lstrip() but it seems to no be doing anything. that is:..with open('web.html') as web_page:.    web = web_page.read().    print(web.lstrip())...will not remove the leading white spaces. replace(' ', '') isn't an option, as it breaks the code (e.g. varconfig={)...tl;dr;.how can i read a web file and remove all the leading white spaces in blank?"
