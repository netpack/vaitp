running multiple for loops at a time i am trying to run multiple for loops in my code. for some reasons it is misbehaving...here is the approach: i'm calling the function1()..def function1():.  all_cohorts = get_all_cohorts().  for chrt in all_cohorts:.    emit_event().    #end of for loop.  # this code should be called after the for loop is done.  call_for_members_of_cohort(all_cohorts) ..def call_for_members_of_cohort(all_cohorts):.  for chrt in all_cohorts:.    get_members_of_cohort(chrt)..def get_members_of_cohort(cohort):.  users = cohort.users.all().  for u in users:.    emit_event()...this is the whole flow of the approach. for some reasons the loops runs 2 times. for example call_for_members_of_cohort function called with 2 cohorts and get_members_of_cohort will run 2 times. but instead it runs more than 2 times...is there anything wrong with the approach? can anyone suggest me to solve this or suggest me an alternamte approach?
