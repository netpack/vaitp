"location.href and fallback for page not available is there a way when i reload a page with blank to have a fallback if the target page is not available? ..example:..i am doing..location.href = 'http://www.google.com'...but maybe google is down (or maybe the url does not exist anymore or is malformed, etc...) and in this case, i would like to avoid the reloading. is that possible?"
