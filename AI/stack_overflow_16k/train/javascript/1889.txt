"creating local variable counterparts of global objects if used multiple times? i recently read, that if a global object (i.e. document) is being called multiple times then it would increase performance of the blank by encapsulating this object into a local variable. ..for example, this should technically run faster....var doc = document;.var a = doc.getelementbyid(""id1"");.var b = doc.getelementbyid(""id2"");.var c = doc.getelementbyid(""id3"");...than this....var a = document.getelementbyid(""id1"");.var b = document.getelementbyid(""id2"");.var c = document.getelementbyid(""id3"");...does this performance increase remain true, even in high availability/offline capable web applications and single page applications? will memory usage grow substantially by creating local variable counterparts of highly used global objects? why?"
