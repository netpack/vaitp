"can't figure out how to use reduce properly my goal is:..var arr = [{name: 'alex'},{name: 'mia'},{name: 'david'}];.bz(arr,'areweawesome','shuar')...this should change arr to:..[{name: 'alex', areweawesome: 'shuar'},{name: 'mia', areweawesome: 'shuar'},{name: 'david', areweawesome: 'shuar'}];...and i actually know how to do this:..function bz(zarr,zkey,zval) {.    for(var i in zarr) {.        zarr[i][zkey] = zval;.    }.}...but i can't figure it out how to implement this with reduce... i just don't see it. i tried many variations, the last one is this:..function bzz(zarr,zkey,zval) {.    return zarr.reduce(function(acc,val){.        return acc[val[zkey] = zval].    },[{}]);.}...i read about reduce in the mdn documentation, but it didn't help... i just can't get it... would appreciate if you could help me with this"
