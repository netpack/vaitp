"how do i combine two objects based off unique similarities in key names? i have two objects, each with four keys in a react component. one of the object's keys contain character values and the other contains integers. i want to display them both inside a jsx tag by descending order according to the numerical object's key values...the hard part is when i then want to have the corresponding character object keys next to the numerical ones. my problem is both objects keys start off indexed in the proper order, when i sort the numerical one, i don't know how to shuffle the character one the same way so they stay synced up...the two objects are pulled from states that i have in my constructor, each of the different points states equals a number. each of the player states equals a name, my intention is to display ""playerx: pointsx  points"" in descending order by points. ..all.points = {{this.state.points1},{this.state.points2},{this.state.points3},{this.state.points4}}..all.players = {{this.state.player1},{this.state.player2},{this.state.player3},{this.state.player4}}...desired output example (with plugged in values):..let: player1: roger.     player2: steve.     player3: mark.     player4: pamela..and let: points1: 4.         points2: 6.         points3: 2.         points4: 5.&lt;div&gt;.steve: 6 points.pamela: 5 points.roger: 4 points.mark: 2 points.&lt;/div&gt;...in short, each of these names and points values are individual states, and i want this.state.playerx linked up to this.state.pointsx while in descending order of points."
