"how to access properties of a blank object using the property values of another object say i have these blank objects:..questions = { name: ""age"", options:[boy, girl, daddy]}.answers = {""age"" : 21, ""boy"" : ""checked"", daddy : ""checked""}...so if i wanted to access the ""age"" from the answers object, i would do:..x = answers.age   //21...but how can i do the same thing but instead using the values from the questions object?..x = answers.questions.name   //problem...or..answers.questions.options[0]  //problem...as you can see i am trying to use the value of questions.name (""age"") to access a property of answers (age)...what's the right syntax or way?"
