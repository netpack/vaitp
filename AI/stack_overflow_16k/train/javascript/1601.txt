"how to use i18n fallback in blank i want to prepare/prevent for the situation when i want to set a locale which isn't supported yet....  so i load .json file, there i can set a language. when i don't have.  the language, how can i set a fallback to the default one?...of course, i can easily prevent this with a own function, but i rather would like to use a provided one. ..i can set the default locale by:..i18n.defaultlocale = ""language"";...is there a fallback method provided in blank which i can call?..edit: my implementation looks like this:..self.localisation = i18n.locale;.if (i18n.translations.hasownproperty(self.localisation)) .    i18n.locale ? self.localisation : ""en"";...the actual question is: ..is there a library call? i prefer to use api and not my own methods in those cases."
