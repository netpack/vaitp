"a user does something but stays at the same page a user is clicking the button with id continuebutton. if they stay on the same page upon after clicking the button, then i trigger uk-awesomeevent...my effort so far ..bootstrapper.on('click', '#continuebutton', function() {.  settimeout(function() {.    //if nothing happens then trigger this event.    if (document.title === 'current address' &amp;&amp; donotgetredirectedtoanotherpagewhenbuttonisclicked) {.      bootstrapper.ensevent.trigger(""uk-awesomeevent"");.    }.  }, 250);.});...desired outcome..in place of donotgetredirectedtoanotherpagewhenbuttonisclicked i want a method that basically states that a user is not redirected to another page. i couldn't find anything online."
