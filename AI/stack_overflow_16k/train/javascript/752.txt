"how to adjust my blank countdown to repeat over again after execution with the following code i want to count down and after the timer has reached 00:00 it will change window location. all is working up until that point. my question is how do i make this process repeat again after the window location has changed? i will be using this for a chrome extension to run in the background...var sec = 5; // set the seconds.var min = 10; // set the minutes..function countdown() {..    sec--;.    if (sec == -1) {.        sec = 59;.        min = min - 1;.    } else {.        min = min;.    }.    if (sec &lt;= 9) {.        sec = ""0"" + sec;.    }.    time = (min &lt;= 9 ? ""0"" + min : min) + "" min and "" + sec + "" sec "";.    document.getelementbyid('thetime').innerhtml = time;.    sd = window.settimeout(""countdown();"", 1000);.    if (min == '00' &amp;&amp; sec == '00') {.        sec = ""00"";.        window.cleartimeout(sd);.        window.location = 'http://mywebsite.com';.    }..}..window.addeventlistener(""load"", countdown, false);"
