"can we change the definition of predefined functions? then how to prevent it? as i understand from my practice (in the google chrome console), we can change the definition of predefined functions. let me explain through code:..function alert(){.  return 2+2;.  }...and i am calling alert(""hi""), it is returning 4, it's ok, as we have defined..but, even when i call window.alert(""hi""), it is returning 4, which is unexpected (for me)...here i just created a new function, i have not mentioned any object name or prototype property, but still it is overriding the window object properties itself...my doubt is, if we change the definition of the function, will it override the definitions of a function with the same name in all the objects??..let's say i have two objects obja and objb, both are having a function named strange(). now i am defining a function strange() in the outside of both the objects. then, whether it will override the definition of strange() in both obja nad objb? if so, why? ..if so, how to prevent this? means how to prevent the overriding in all the objects? ..thanks in advance...!!!!"
