"how can i get just a directory from the url in blank, omitting the domain? i have a domain name that looks like this:..http://www.example.com/abc/xyz/something_something...or sometimes just:..http://www.example.com/abc/...in either case want to get just the abc part. i found this answer, which suggests the following code:..document.url.substr(0,document.url.lastindexof('/'))...which returns:..http://www.example.com/abc/xyz/...how can i extend the above code to extract out only the first directory name?..note that it's always the first directory after the domain name, and the directory is always a 3 letter code."
