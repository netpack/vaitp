"can location.replace randomly select two possible urls? i am trying to do a poor-mans version of multivariate testing on our website. what i want to do is use a piece of blank that will randomly choose between two urls that i declare within the blank and use that as the source url for the location.replace function. ..i've not tried much because i am not a programmer in any sense of the word. if i have some code i can generally make my way through it, understand it and make small changes...here is the code that i am currently using:..location.replace(""https://www.example.com/pagea.html"");..what i want to happen is that when i fire the location.replace code it will will either choose ..https://www.example.com/pagea.html.or.https://www.example.com/pageb.html..i think i have to put all this in an array?..any help would be most appreciated."
