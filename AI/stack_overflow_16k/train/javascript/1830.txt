"identify number of li from group of li onclick i'm trying to identify a li element from a group of li inside  of div..&lt;div id=""group""&gt;.&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;.&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;.&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;...its quite simple tho, i could give each li an unique id and this problem would be over. like..var listitem1,2,3 = document.getelementbyid('liitem1,2,3') etc.listitem1,2,3.addeventlistener('click',function);...this might be handy when it comes to 1,2 or 3 elements but this is all static and when it start to scale its not possible anymore, instead im trying to make use of nodelist...var nodelist = document.getelementbyid('group').getelementsbytagname('li');...now i will have a nodelist with li 0, li 1, li 2.the problem comes now becouse i donÂ´t know how to trace which li is being clicked...nodelist.addeventlistener('click',function);...wont work here becouse it dosent know which one is being clicked at here...nodelist[0].addeventlistener('click',function);...is the same solution as above. how can i trace which of the li is being clicked at? only plain/raw blank"
