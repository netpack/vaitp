"calling functions in sequence using callbacks i'm a newbie to blank and i'm struggling with the whole callback and asynchronous thing. i have a function called 'runjob' which executes another function called 'getdata' several times. after these functions have finished executing i wish to do some more processing, but not until the those functions have finished. how can i do this?..//a button with 'runjob()' as the onclick event..function runjob() {..    processdata(getdata, ""condition1"");.    processdata(getdata, ""condition2"");.    processdata(getdata, ""condition3"");..    //more processing when the ajax calls in 'getdata' have finished.}..function processdata(callback, myvariable) {.    callback(myvariable);.}..function getdata(myvariable) {.    //multiple ajax calls which will take a while.}"
