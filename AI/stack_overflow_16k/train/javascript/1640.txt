value of another object as value in another associative array in blank so i have an array called xyz containing keys a and b..i want to input these into another array as follows :..seats =[{ .        name : xyz.a..        address: xyz.b}];...however the xyz.a is being stored as an object and not by it's value in seats.name and prints undefined when i use console.log..i want to store xyz.a by its value such that seats.name gives the value stored in xyz.a
