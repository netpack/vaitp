"blank token, category search field like mail a little while ago i came across a blank search box that had token input like that in lions finder or mail, where the tokens have a category element that is auto completed as well as the query element. i have spent much of the day so far trying to find it, but i seem to have lost my bookmark and can't find it on google. has anyone else used this or know who created it?..hope you can help..thank you :)"
