"how do you enclose unknown html in a div with plain blank? i have an html page that has varying types of content. i would like to make a blank function that when run encloses anything inside the &lt;body&gt; tag with a &lt;div id=""content-container""&gt;. then i want to be able to add a &lt;div id=""verifying""&gt;&lt;/div&gt; that new &lt;div&gt;. i think i know how to do this with jquery, but i need to do it with plain blank. ..any idea as to how this would be done?"
