"chrome: cannot read property 'getall' of undefined i'm new to javascipt and just trying out some examples i found in the net. this one doesn't work at all. i open about:blank in chrome and use a console there. when i run this code there's an error cannot read property 'getall' of undefined'.    ..chrome.windows.getall({populate:true}, getallopenwindows);..    function getallopenwindows(windata) {..      var tabs = [];.      for (var i in windata) {.        if (windata[i].focused === true) {.            var wintabs = windata[i].tabs;.            var tottabs = wintabs.length;.            for (var j=0; j&lt;tottabs;j++) {.              tabs.push(wintabs[j].url);.            }.        }.      }.      console.log(tabs);.    }...also it seems like chrome doesn't have property windows in it..."
