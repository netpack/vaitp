"how to enable on click after removing it? i have two conditions here, cond1 and cond2 .if its the cond1 i will disable my onclick event, else i will enable it...this is what i fished out :..if(cond1) {.    document.getelementbyid('mtag').removeattribute(""onclick"");.} else {.    document.getelementbyid('mtag').setattribute('onclick');.}...the problem is once the onclick gets disabled , its not getting enabled again. if its cond2 , then it must be enabled . what am i doing wrong? kindly suggest some solution to this."
