"blank to insert decimal to the ones place onkeyup has period persist after clearing the textbox i have some simple blank that automatically inserts a decimal in the numbers as you type. three functions for one, two, and three decimal places. the two and three decimal place functions work how i desire, where when you backspace or clear the textbox, the placeholder text is replaced. however the one decimal place function leaves the period in the textbox after backspacing or deleting. what do i need to do to allow it to function like the other two?..the functions are as follows:..function formatasdollars1(el) {.    el.value = el.value.replace(/[^d]/g, '').replace(/(d?)$/, '.$1');.}..function formatasdollars2(el) {.    el.value = el.value.replace(/[^d]/g, '').replace(/(dd?)$/, '.$1');.}..function formatasdollars3(el) {.    el.value = el.value.replace(/[^d]/g, '').replace(/(ddd?)$/, '.$1');.}...i set up a jsfiddle to show what i mean here"
