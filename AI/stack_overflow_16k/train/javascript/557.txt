"how do i turn key value pairs in object into array of objects? i have some code that outputs an object with key value pairs. like so:..{""a"" : ""1"", ""b"" : ""2"", ""c"" : ""3""}...i would like to change that output to this instead:..[{""a"" : ""1""}, {""b"" : ""2""}, {""c"" : ""3""}]...i have fiddled around with object.entries(), object.assign() and array.map() without getting much further. i have put so much time into this now so i figured it was time to ask for some help...the initial data is from req.query which i have then managed to convert from:..{a: ""1"", b: ""2"", c: ""3""} ...into ..{""x.a"": ""1"", ""x.b"": ""2"", ""x.c"": ""3""}...this will eventually become a mongodb query...below is what i have so far...let obj = object.entries(req.query);.obj = obj.map(([key, val]) =&gt; [""x.""+ key, val]);.let newobj = object.assign(...obj.map(([k, v]) =&gt; ({ [k]: v })));...which gives:..{""x.a"": ""1"", ""x.b"": ""2"", ""x.c"": ""3""}...so, as per my initial question. how do i turn this into:..[{""x.a"" : ""1""}, {""x.b"" : ""2""}, {""x.c"" : ""3""}]"
