"how to call 2 child functions in one main function i have several functions in blank whose results i want to use in an if statement in another function. ..my problem is that only the first listed child function seems to be returning a result. when i swap the order of the functions around then i still only get a returning result from the child function listed first. ..i'm a beginner and not all that familiar with functions just yet. see my example below. please be specific with any answers...function main(a) {.  return functone(x);  // name of function is actually ""functone"" for this example.  return functtwo(y);  // name of function is actually ""functtwo"" for this example..  if(functone(x)!=""true"") {.    return false;.  } else {.    if(functtwo(y)!=""true) {.      return false;.    } else {.      return true;.    }.  }.}"
