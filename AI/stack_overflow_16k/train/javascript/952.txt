"how to compare 6 values against each other and determine greatest value i am working on a script that needs to determine which variable has the highest number in it. i have 6 variables, each is passed a value at run time and i need to determine which variable has the highest number in it. ..because of the amount of potential combinations (6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720), a straight comparison is out of the question. how should i go about this?"
