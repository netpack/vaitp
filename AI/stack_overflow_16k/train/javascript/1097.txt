"several questions about coding blank oop style i am learning to code blank oop style and i have a few questions, mostly about declaring variables and not using global ones...question 1 - am i doing the following coding correctly?..here i declare the ""fields"" class:../**. * display fields. */.var fields = function(){..    this.display = function(fields){..        var test = '1st method of declaring test';.        this.test = '2nd method of declaring test';..        for (var i = 0, len = fields.length; i &lt; len; i++) {..            jquery('[name=' + fields[i] + ']').closest('.row').css('display', 'block');..        }.    };.}...now i instantiate the class fields, creating the object fields..// fields object.var fields = new fields();..fields.display(requiredfields.concat(normalfields));...question 2 - which is the correct way of declaring class variables - in this case: ""test"":..this.test = 'value'...or just:..var test = 'value'...can you explain why 1 method is preferred over the other?..question 3 - is the ""i"" inside the for loop declared correctly? is this the correct way of doing it?  or i need to be using something like:..this.i = 0..any advice on good practices is strongly appreciated...i read allot on the net but i am new to oop altogether and i want to make sure i am on a correct path. ..ty!"
