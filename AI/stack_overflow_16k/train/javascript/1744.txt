"blank - use array to iterate through fields? i have a form and would like to verify that a few fields that it contains have an entry...as such i have the following:..        var requiredfields = array(.                                'delivery_first_name',.                                'delivery_last_name',.                                'delivery_address',.                                'delivery_city',.                                'delivery_zip',.                                'delivery_phone'.        );.        for(var field in requiredfields).        {.            if(document.ezpay.field.value.length == 0).            {.                document.ezpay.field.style.csstext = 'background:red;';.            }.        }...however it does not appear to be working. my thoughts are that the field portion of  if(document.ezpay.field.value.length == 0)"" is not being evaluated. ..in other words, the statement is executing as  if(document.ezpay.field.value.length == 0) rather than  if(document.ezpay.delivery_first_name.value.length == 0)...can anyone confirm that belief and more importantly give me some guidance as to why the above is not working?..the goal of the above is to iterate through the defined fields and set the css style background to red for any fields that are empty...thanks!  :)"
