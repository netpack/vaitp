"why are instance methods defined in the prototype but instance fields are defined in the constructor? when doing inheritance in blank, the pattern that i always see defines instance methods in the prototype, but instance fields in the constructor (see example below). what is the motivation for this? why not be consistent and define both in the prototype?..function myclass() {.    this.myfield = 0; // why this....}.myclass.prototype.myfield = 0; // ...instead of this?"
