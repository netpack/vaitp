"split() is not giving the expected outcome i'm having problems why my .split() function..somehow when i splay my line the first [0] element in the array can be accessed but the 2nd [1] can't..i have the following string:.. ,{""relationid"":""000001"",""recid"":""1d2712eb-4f08-4b4f-b6e9-600c9631b503""...and the code below is how i try to split this (temparray contains a x number of strings like the above):..var templine = temparray[i].substr(1, temparray[i].length);.//alert(templine);.var line = templine.split(',');.var s1 = line[0].split('""')[3];.var s2 = line[1].split('""')[3];...when i use alert(s1) or alert(s2) i do get the value however, the folowing error always occurs on the last line (var s2):...  caught typeerror: cannot read property 'split' of undefined...this causes the rest of my script to crash and it won't finish what it's supposed to, displaying an empty page...my question, what is going wrong here? why does s1 function properly and s2 which is exactly the same except for the index of the line array crash my script...i want to emphasise when i use the alert function to check the value of my variable s1 and s2 they do contain the right value...edit:.maybe a nice bonus since there might be an easyer way..after i've gotten the values s1 and s2 i want to put them in a map like so:..map[s2] = s1;...as you can probably tell the string i use is the result of splitting 1 humongous string on ('}'). the code displayed here is what i do when looping trough this array."
