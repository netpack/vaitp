"why blanks functions are not loaded one after the other? at the beginning of my html iam initializing variable ""moviesrc"" like this:..&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;..        var activestep = geturlvars();.        var moviesrc;..        cloud.getstepsformodules(activestep.module, ""umck"").then(function(steps) {..            var calculatedstep = activestep.step - 1;.            moviesrc = steps.steps[calculatedstep].movie;..        });...at the end of my html i have some function for videojs...&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;.    _v_(""movie"").ready(function() {.        var myplayer = this;.        myplayer.src(moviesrc);.&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;...i dont understand why a html part at the end will be loaded first and a one after the other at the beginning of my page as a second one. i need it opposite!.i need to keep videojs script at the end of the page because  with video should be loaded first and just after that a script. ..conclusion: moviesrc in myplayer.src(moviesrc) is alwas empty :(, but why?"
