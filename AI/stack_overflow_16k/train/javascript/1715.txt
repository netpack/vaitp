"need help on developing an array or function which will be able to carry over the choices you made i'm working on a school project which requires developing an interactive menu. i have limited knowledge on many aspects of blank and html as i've been learning it for a couple of months. i am making a uniform menu which allows the user to theoretically buy uniform items (i'm not actually adding in payment options)...i need help on being able to create a function or something similar which will display the choices you have made and also carry over the choices you made, which will result a confirm message.....in the above screenshot, pretend a user wanted 2 small blazers. so the user would click on small and click on enter quantity and type in 2. the user would then click on confirm order which will bring up a confirm message like..you have chosen to confirm 2 small sized blazers for $400. confirm?...the problem is i don't know how to create this message which varies on what size and how many items a user wants...sample code in jsfiddle: sorry if this doesn't quite make much sense. i've tried my best at explaining my problem so i might have missed out important details. so if i did, please tell...html:..    &lt;td&gt;blazer (all sizes) - $200&lt;/td&gt;.    &lt;td&gt;&lt;button onclick=""small()""&gt;small&lt;/button&gt; .    &lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick=""medium()""&gt;medium&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;.    &lt;button onclick=""large()""&gt;large&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/td&gt;.    &lt;td&gt;&lt;button onclick=""quantitynumber()""&gt;enter quantity&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/td&gt;.    &lt;td&gt;&lt;button onclick=""confirmorder()""&gt;confirm order&lt;/button&gt; ...js:..var blz = 0  .function small().  {.      blz = confirm ('you have selected size: small. confirm?').  }.   function medium().  {.      blz = confirm ('you have selected size: medium. confirm?').  }.   function large().  {.      blz = confirm ('you have selected size: large. confirm?').  }.. function quantitynumber(). {.     blz = prompt ('enter the number of blazer(s) to order').     blz1 = blz * 200.        if ( blz == 1) {.    blz1 = confirm ('you have chosen to order 1 blazer for $' + blz1 + '. confirm?').    }..            else if ( blz &gt;=2  &amp;&amp; blz &lt;= 5) {.    blz1 = confirm ('you have chosen to order ' + blz + ' blazers for $' + blz1 + '. confirm?')         .    }..    else if (blz &gt;5) {.        alert('there is a limit of 5 blazers per customer.').        blz = null.        blz1= null.    }.    else if (blz = isnan || blz == '') {.        alert ('please type in a valid number.').    }.. }.function confirmorder().{.    if (blz == small &amp;&amp; blz &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; blz &lt;= 5) {.    blz1 = confirm ('you have chosen to confirm ' + blz + ' small sized blazers for $' + blz1 + '. confirm?').    }..}"
