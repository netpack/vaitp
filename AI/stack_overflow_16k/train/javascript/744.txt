"understanding the use of || in the code i am relatively new to blank and i was trying to understand the use of || in the current code. ..so, i was going through this amazing article on web about reduce in blank where he wrote this example ..const fruitbasket = ['banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'apple', 'cherry', 'orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'fig' ];..const count = fruitbasket.reduce( (tally, fruit) =&gt; {.  tally[fruit] = (tally[fruit] || 0) + 1 ;.  return tally;.} , {})..count // { banana: 2, cherry: 3, orange: 3, apple: 2, fig: 1 }...[question] here, i am unable to understand two things ..tally[fruit] = (tally[fruit] || 0) + 1 ; ...what is this || doing here and why did he used it? (i know this is an or operator)..and secondly what does this mean , {}) at the end of function?"
