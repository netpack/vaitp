"accessing property of constructor without creating new instance is it possible to access properties of a constructor object/function without first creating an instance from it? ..for example, let's say i have this constructor:..function cat() {.  this.legs = 4;.};...and now – without creating a new cat instance – i want to know what value of legs is inside the constructor. is this possible?..(and i'm not looking for stuff like: var legs = new cat().legs. (let's say the instantiation of a new cat is super cpu expensive for some reason.))"
