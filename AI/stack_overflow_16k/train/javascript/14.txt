"what i should send to a blank front end (client) after a user authentication i'm sorry, i'm having a mental block: i'm not sure what i should send to a blank front end (client) after a user authentication on the server. i know that there needs to be some controls for the user (user/admin)to click but i'm not sure what to send that's secure and what not to send that's not secure. i've been told hidden controls are not secure. i know how to implement user authentication on the server. i understand a check on the server needs to be made if a control is clicked to check if the user (user/admin) has the right permissions for that control before the server executes the control function (on the server). i know i can set a variable and send it to the front end, once it's received (ajax response) add controls (appendchild). if i do it this way, i feel it's not secure because all the code to do this is easily viewable by the browser (page source)."
