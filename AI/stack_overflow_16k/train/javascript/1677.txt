"is all blank object reference type? all, say we have the code like below...var b ={};..var a=b;.b=null;.if (a==null).{.    alert('a is null');.}...before the code running, i had thought the a should be null, because i thought a and b are pointing to same object or they are supposed to be the same address. but it is not . isn't blank object reference type like classical language (c++/c#/java)? or did i miss something important? thanks."
