"using ""new"" in constructors, john resig`s #35 this is from john resig`s learning advanced blank #35 http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#35 , called  what happens when we forget to use the new operator? ..so he`s telling us that name variable (which i assume is window.name) gets overridden, but ..1) is that overriding done inside the function user i.e. does this.name set a new global value for name?..2) how would have using ""new user"" (i.e. a constructor?) prevented overriding the window.name variable? is it because ""new user"" would only be an instance of user, but window.name is global?..thanks if you can help explain. ..function user(first, last){ .  this.name = first + "" "" + last; .} ..window.name = ""resig""; .var user = user(""john"", name); ..assert( name == ""john resig"", ""the name variable is accidentally overridden."" );"
