"date.utc() for years between 0-100 running into a problem utilizing date.utc() because date.utc() automatically converts any year between 0-99 into 1900-1999 when i need the function to maintain the original year passed to it. i have tried passing a string for the year with leading 0's but i am still having the same problem...update:.thanks for the replies and after reading the mdn doc, i resorted to a work-around which works for me in chrome &amp; firefox...function getutc(date) {.  var year = date.getutcfullyear();.  if (year &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; year &lt; 100) {.    //calculate the difference in ms between utc time and local time.    var diff = (new date(0,0,1,0,0,0,0)).gettime() - date.utc(0,0,1,0,0,0,0);.    //return the local time plus the calculated difference.    return date.gettime() + diff;.  }.  return date.utc(date.getutcfullyear(), date.getutcmonth(), date.getutcdate(), date.getutchours(), date.getutcminutes(), date.getutcseconds(), date.getutcmilliseconds());.}...an easier way of getting the utc time is to assign the return value of .setutcfullyear(1200,0,1) or whichever .setutc______() method to a variable...var date = new date();.var time = date.setutcfullyear(1200,0,1).// time equals -24298834086121"
