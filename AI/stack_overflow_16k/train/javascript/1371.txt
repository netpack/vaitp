"how to get pointer to a local variable in blank? let say i know that a variable is called ""myvar"", it is declared in a self calling function..(function (){.    var myvar=0;.    setinterval(function(){ .            console.log(myvar++);.        }, 3000);  .})();...but i don't know where this function is called, and don't want to reverse engineer tons of js. i want to find a reference to this variable so i can display it in console something like window.rootobject.subobject.myvar . i tried to make a function that does recursive seek for key from the window object, but it does a stackoverflow, certainly because of circular references (an object contain reference to its containing object)...is there any simple way to find where is this object ?....edit : the original question was about finding a var in global space having just its name, without knowing if it was descendent of window object or stored in environementrecord. the sample code i provided was misleading, so i edited the question and accepted an answer to make it usefull."
