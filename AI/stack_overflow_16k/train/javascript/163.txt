"how do you enumerate over error objects in blank? i've looked around and have failed to find an answer to this. ..what i am trying to do is print all the properties available in an error object for error reporting. it may be impossible, but i would at least like to know why...i have tried the following in chrome and firefox on ubuntu 12.04...try {.   throw new error('foo');.} catch (x) {.   console.log(object.keys(x)); // [].   for (var i in x) console.log(i); // prints nothing.}"
