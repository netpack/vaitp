"how to write js functions like operand(operator(operand))? i can't seem to wrap my head around the logic for writing a function that looks something like eight(times(five)) in blank...example:...eight(times(five)) should return 40.three(plus(two)) should return 5...it was a codewars problem. it provided empty functions for numbers 0-9 that looked like ""eight( ){ }"" as well as empty functions for operators that looked like ""times( ){ }."" the solution should be such that executing ""eight(plus(three))"" would return 11, etc."
