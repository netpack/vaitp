"blank does not execute so in my head> i have the following piece of code:..function dynamicphoneaddon(){.while(true){.    var phone = document.myform.phone.value;.    document.getelementbyid('writeme').innerhtml ='&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""returl"" value=""http://urlremoved/thankyou.php?customer=' + phone + '""&gt;';.    }.}...then i have a body onload=""dynamicphoneaddon()"" to call this script. it's supposed to constantly modify the contents of a div id=""writeme"" by using the value from the phone field of form myform...however, the script doesn't run. i haven't done any work with blank before, so i think it's probably something obvious... is it because i'm calling an infinite loop? or am i trying to do something impossible?..the end result i'm trying to achieve is to make a hidden value that has a link to a url with a variable (the phone number) at the end."
