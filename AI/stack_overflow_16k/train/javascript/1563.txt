"why do alert(!!""0"") and alert(false == ""0"") both output true in blank as far as i know in blank !! is supposed to normalize a boolean value converting it to true or false from some other type. this would mean that the ""0"" converts to boolean true. on the other hand if i compare it with false it turns out that it is in fact false (as the result of the comparison is true). what rule am i missing here. i have tested it in ie and opera."
