"blank - difference between this and var in class object would like to know what is the difference between variable test1 and test2 in the following code...function myclass(){.var test1 = 'abc';.this.test2 = 'def';..this.method1 = function(){.    someobj(this.success);.}..this.success = function(){.    console.log(test1); //able to output value.    console.log(this.test2); //unable to get the output.            console.log(test2); //unable to get the output.}.}...edit: to make more precise, i was trying to access to the variable from an inner function. i couldn't access to the test2 variable, but able to extract the value from test1."
