"calling function in chrome console doesn't appear to work so on a friend's website, i was testing a function..i tried ""settokens(10);"" which should apparently set the token amount to 10, and it does, but once the page is refreshed, the token amount is then reset back to it's original amount. i've tested other functions of this nature in the console as well and everything is then reset after a refresh. is there a certain reason why this happening and/or a way to actually make the function work properly? thanks!..ps: i'm not very experienced with web development so sorry if this problem has a really easy solution...this is the function which set's the tokens...function settokens(value){try{$(""#usertokens"").text(value.tofixed(2));}catch(e){$(""#usertokens"").text(value);}}...in the console, i use the following:..settokens(10);"
