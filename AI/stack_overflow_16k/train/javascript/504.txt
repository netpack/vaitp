"detect link in string and insert anchor tag in blank i have a string like this:..let string = ""this is some text, this [should be a link](https://www.google.com.ar)"";...like markdown, but i don't want to use a whole markdown library cause the links are the only things i should look for...this string above should generate this:..""this is some text, this &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com.ar"" target=""_blank""&gt;should be a link&lt;/a&gt;""...edit: to be more precise, i don't want to use a markdown parse because i don't to replace all the other markdown stuff, just the links."
