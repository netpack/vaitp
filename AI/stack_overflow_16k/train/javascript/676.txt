"async & performance example in ""you don't know js"" everytime i try to read ""you don't know js"", i run into examples where i can't seem to understand if it's a mistake by the author or js is really that mind blowing. consider this example under ""parallel threads"" in the chapter ""async &amp; performance"": ..var a = 20;..function foo() {.    a = a + 1;.}..function bar() {.    a = a * 2;.}..// ajax(..) is some arbitrary ajax function given by a library.ajax( ""http://some.url.1"", foo );.ajax( ""http://some.url.2"", bar );...then the author proceeds with the following explanation:...  in blank's single-threaded behavior, if foo() runs before bar(),.  the result is that a has 42, but if bar() runs before foo() the result.  in a will be 41....how can it be that, if foo() gets run first, the result is 41? i tried this example many times in the console, and i always get 21 following this logic:...we declare a var with the integer value of 20..we write functions foo() and bar(). in foo, we say 'set the var of a to be a + 1 i.e. 20 + 1'..then we call them with arbitrary ajax function. if foo() gets called first, the result is 21, not 41....am i wrong and just plain stupid for missing out something?"
