"getting the function name of a function in an anonymous function if i have this code:..const foo = cb =&gt; {console.log(cb.name)} //access here..const bar = ()=&gt;null..foo(()=&gt;bar())...is there a way for me to access bar's prototype from foo? (in this case the name)..cb.name // '' (anonymous function).cb().name // tries to access null.name (return of bar)...this question is more about my curiosity, i'm not looking for workarounds."
