how to play a sound when first entering a webpage? how would i make an mp3 play on my html page but only the first time someone enters? so that if they came back to that same page a second time they wouldn't hear the sound a second time?..edit: i know how to play sounds and everything i just need to find out the 'first time only' part of it.
