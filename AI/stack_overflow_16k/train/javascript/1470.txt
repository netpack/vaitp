"is it safe to use ""get"" and ""set"" as property names in blank? is it generally safe to use get and set as the names of properties for an object literal, like this:..var myobject={.    get: 'value1',.    set: 'value2'.}...get and set do not appear to be reserved words in blank, but i'm worried this could cause clashes with some built-in behaviors. in particular get and set seem to have some pretty unique behavior in the object.defineproperties method:..object.defineproperties(someobject,{.    'property1':{.        get:function(){.            return property1;.        },.        set:function(val){.            property1=val;.        },.        enumerable:true;.    }.});...in this built-in behavior, the get and set aren't treated as normal properties but actually execute their respective functions when someobject.property1 is accessed or assigned to...because of how they're used in object.defineproperties i've always sort of treated get and set as special reserved words. so my question is, is that a good rule of thumb or should i just learn to stop worrying and just use get and set whenever it seems semantically appropriate?"
