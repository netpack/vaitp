"back button within the same spa i am writing a single page application in blank. the url changes but there are no page reloads..in my app i have a browser-like navigation with a back button, that actually runs window.back() . i also keep a backcounter variable (increased every time a user clicks on a link or goes back, listening to popstate)  to make sure that the app back button doesn't let user go a blank tab...i realise that ther are security implications when reading the history, and i have read answers here about it...question: is there a reliable way for me to know when the user has pressed ""back"" within the same spa? i can think of two possible paths:...neutralise. i could maybe neutralise the function of the back button by forcing a specific location on popstate.integration. i would love to be able to know if the user has clicked on back or forward so that i can update backcounter accordingly.......ideas?"
