"blank: event for when video src is loaded? is there an event listener for when a video's src is loaded?..i've noticed sometimes youtube takes a few seconds to load the video src on safari mobile on iphone. ideally there is a callback on htmlvideoelement.prototype for when src is loaded...i've tried this w3schools..var vid = document.getelementbyid(""myvideo"");.vid.onloadeddata = function() {.    alert(""browser has loaded the current frame"");.};...but with no luck."
