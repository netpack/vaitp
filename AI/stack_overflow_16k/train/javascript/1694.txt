"getters and settings in blank i want to understand why do we use getters and setters in blank? when should it be used...i know the general concept of getters and setters...for example:..    var obj = new object();.    obj['abc'] = ""something""; //setting an object..    console.log(obj['abc']); //getting...if a similar mechanism is achieved using the above code, when do we need to use getters and setters?..can someone explain?"
