"js beginner- how to parse through all child nodes immediately at one level lower than a dom node in a web page i understand that for a web page's node stored in a variable named 'parent', i can obtain all its child nodes using the command ..var children=parent.childnodes;...i have 2 questions here-- ..(a) will the above line of code only provide the nodes that are immediate children? or will nodes even lower than immediate children also be stored in 'children' variable?..(b) how can i parse through each node in the 'children' variable?"
