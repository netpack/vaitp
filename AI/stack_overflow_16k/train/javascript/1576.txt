"how do i return an array of objects that only contains a certain object in an array for blank? i have an array of object called actors:..const actors =  [{.   ""name"": ""john doe"",.   ""rating"": 1234,.   ""alternative_name"": null,.   ""objectid"": ""551486300"".},.{.   ""name"": ""jane doe"",.   ""rating"": 4321,.   ""alternative_name"": ""monica anna maria bellucci"",.   ""objectid"": ""551486310"".}];...i specifically want to get the name and the ratings of the actors..i tried getting it by making a function called actornamerating, but my code does not work...const nameandrating = function() {..    const actorname = nameandrating.filter(name);.    return actorname;..    const actorrating = nameandrating.filter(rating);.    return actorrating;. };"
