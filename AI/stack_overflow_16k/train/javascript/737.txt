"how to avoid 'cannot read property of undefined' errors? in my code, i deal with an array that has some entries with many objects nested inside one another, where as some do not. it looks something like the following:..// where this array is hundreds of entries long, with a mix.// of the two examples given.var test = [{'a':{'b':{'c':""foo""}}}, {'a': ""bar""}];...this is giving me problems because i need to iterate through the array at times, and the inconsistency is throwing me errors like so:..for (i=0; i&lt;test.length; i++) {.    // ok on i==0, but 'cannot read property of undefined' on i==1.    console.log(a.b.c);.}...i am aware that i can say if(a.b){ console.log(a.b.c)}, but this is extraordinarily tedious in cases where there are up to 5 or 6 objects nested within one another. is there any other (easier) way that i can have it only do the console.log if it exists, but without throwing an error?"
