"how to stop execution after changing window.location? say i have some mobile check at the very top of my script:..if (ismobile) {.    window.location.href = '/m/' + window.location.pathname + window.location.search;.}...and i also have some metrics down the code (or even in some other module that is loaded asynchronously) that are being sent to my metrics server...my question is: how can i stop execution of everything that goes below my window.location change? or even better, how to stop the whole blank engine so that it doesn't execute any other asynchronously loaded modules?..i know that i can do mobile proxying in many different ways, but in this task my mobile redirect must be run on the client side, it is a given."
