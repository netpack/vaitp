"how do i get the next entry in an array instead of the current one? i have a snippet of code that does this:..if it's between 0000 and 0600, it'll display ""night."" if it's between 0600 and 1200, it'll display ""morning."" if it's between 1200 and 1800 it shows ""afternoon"" and between 1800 and 2400 ""evening.""..what i want it to do, however, is to show the next entry in the array, not the current one. so, between 0600 and 1200 it should show ""afternoon"" and not ""morning.""..here is my code for it:....function starttime() {..  var today = new date();.  var h = today.gethours();.  var m = today.getminutes();.  var wv = today.getday();..  var hv = 100 * h + m;..  var wv1 = new array();.  wv1[0] = '0000,0600,night';.  wv1[1] = '0600,1200,morning';.  wv1[2] = '1200,1800,afternoon';.  wv1[3] = '1800,2400,evening';.  .  if (wv == 1) {.    wv1.foreach(function(entry) {.      var schedule = entry.split(',');.      if (hv &gt;= schedule[0] &amp;&amp; hv &lt;= schedule[1]) {..        var timeofday = schedule[2];..        //schedule.        document.getelementbyid('day').innerhtml = timeofday;..      }.    });.  }.}.&lt;body onload=""starttime()""&gt;.  &lt;div id=""main-wrapper""&gt;.    &lt;div id=""day""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.  &lt;/div&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;"
