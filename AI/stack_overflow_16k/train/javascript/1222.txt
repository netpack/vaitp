"changing timer interval after first iteration has completed in pure blank, i am presently using a timer to change six background images. i have set the script to infinitely repeat the looping as long as the window is open. however, after the first loop, i would like to reset the timer increment value from 3250 milliseconds to say 7000 milliseconds for all loops after the first one has completed at the faster rate...&lt;script&gt;.  function shiftbackgrd(interval, frames) {.    var int = 1;..    function incrementanswersbkgrnds() {.        document.body.id = ""b""+int;.        int++;.        if(int === frames) { int = 1; }.    }..    var swap = window.setinterval(incrementanswersbkgrnds, interval);.  }.  shiftbackgrd(3250, 7); //milliseconds, frames.&lt;/script&gt;"
