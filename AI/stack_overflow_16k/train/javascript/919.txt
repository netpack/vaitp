"blank update controls onload iv'e got 2 html pages .one performs a ""get"" method on the other .these pages are duplicates in that they own they both poses a form with the same control types .and control names..when i submit my form from the source page my url string consist of the values appended together after a '?' char ..  ....?txtname=era&amp;txtage=28&amp;gender=male&amp;langhe=on&amp;langen=on&amp;select=1   ...in the detestation page onload i call a function which splits the control names and their values and sets them ..        // this is called from &lt;body onload=""f();""&gt;.        function f() {.        var st = new string(location.search);.        st = st.substring(1, st.length);                        .        var input = st.split('&amp;');..        var value;.        var ctrl;.        var val;.        var _control; ..        for (var i = 0; i &lt; input.length; i++) .        {.            value = input[i].substring(0, input[i].length);.            ctrl = value.substring(0, value.indexof('='));.            val = value.substring(value.indexof('=') + 1, value.length);.            _control = document.getelementsbyname(ctrl);                .            _control.value = val; .        }                                                                        .    }...i debugged this function and checked that every thing is put in to place as it should .the problem is that after the value are set to the controls.they do not appear on the page , as if they didn't get set at all ..additionally in google chrome i get a ""aw,snap!"" error after these actions  (aw snap happens only when i debug  )..i'm new to java-script and i'm guessing there's a problem with the way i'm assigning these values , i tried also just the first control which is a text type input and it also does not get updated  ...any idea's on why this doesn't work ?.thanks in advance.eran."
