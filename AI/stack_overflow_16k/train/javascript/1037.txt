"unexpected alert with message ""undefined"" after successfully calling simple function with arguments can anyone tell me why the following code produces the alert box that i expect (ryetofurye), but then produces a second alert box with the message ""undefined?""  at least that's what it's doing in the latest firefox on my windows 7 machine...function makesandwich(bread, meat) {.alert(bread + meat + bread);.}.var mysandwich = makesandwich('rye', 'tofu');.alert(mysandwich);"
