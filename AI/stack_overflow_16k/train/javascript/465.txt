"""requestanimationframe()"" fps = display refresh rate? is this affect the performance? i tested the ""requestanimationframe()"" method speed and i noticed that it fires exactly at the speed of my monitor refresh rate (60 / 100 / 144)...i suppose the browser keeps track of the refresh rate of the display and applies it to the ""requestanimationframe"" method.i believe it does not affect the performance because it stacks multiple functions and executes them in the same frame. .am i right, can you please confirm these?"
