"method to clone image object in js without a request to a server i am trying to make a chess board. i have managed to load all the images into an image array. so that i don't have to repeatedly request the server for the images. .(you would say browser cache would manage that,(if at all it will) but lets assume, it won't)..so the problem i face now is that each image that has to be repeated for example: the pawns, the blank spaces, rooks and knights,.after adding to a table cell, and then re-adding to another table cell, doesn't give me two pawns. but only one. i guess that is because it is a single image object. ..so i thought i'd clone the image object every time i have to use it. so what are the different ways to clone it. ..i haven't use jquery at all, ever. so i tried including this code in my script ..function cloneblank(blank,c) {.    var img = jquery.extend({},blank[c]);.    return img;.}...error: uncaught referenceerror: jquery is not defined..(read about the exted method here :cloning a blank object?)..i have also read about the .clone() method, but have no idea how it is used..moreover, does any of these methods ensure that the images would not be re-requested from the server and just copied as objects in memory (else what is the point of having a image buffer). ..secondly are there any methods that do ensure such behaviour."
