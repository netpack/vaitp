"blank- print out options from select menus i am currently working on a blank project that requires me to dynamically generate three drop down menus. i currently have everything working, but their is one last feature i don't know how to implement. ..how do i print out the user's choices of the options they made from the select menu? for example, if the user chose food, fruit, and watermelon, i would print out ""you choose food, which is a fruit, and you like watermelon."" something along those lines. how would i print out the choices the users made if the other two select menus were dynamically generated?..edit: i cannot use jquery or innerhtml for this project."
