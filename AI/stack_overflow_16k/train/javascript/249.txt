"get blank loaded content let's say i have a button on a page, if clicked it adds a div popup...how can i access the div's content through blank? is this possible? i've tried searching the page with jquery selectors but i did not find the div popup...i have a bookmarklet that is similar to what follows:..blank:(function() {.    alert($('newdivid').val());.})();......suppose that  newdivid is the id of the newly created div, if i execute that code by clicking on the bookmarklet i get an error saying that val() cannot be invoked on a null object...i do not have access to the page source; do you have any suggestion?"
