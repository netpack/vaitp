"can i modify the status value of a key within a mouse event handler? for some purpose, i need something in blank like this:..function onmousedown(e) {//mouse event handler .  e.shiftkey = true;.}...but this seems doesn't work, shiftkey still keeps it's original value after e.shiftkey = true...i am using a third party model, there is already a mouse event handler, but the function in it requires the shift key down, but i don't want it as a condition."
