"object.assign(...) attempts to set properties without setters when specifically defining a get-only property on an object, and then attempting to assign another object on top of the original, object.assign seems to not care whether or not a target property is read-only:..var myobj = {.    firstname: ""jimbo"",.  lastname: ""smythe"".};..object.defineproperty(myobj, ""fullname"", {.    get: function () {.    return this.firstname + "" "" + this.lastname;.  }.});..object.assign(myobj, {.  fullname: ""jimbo t. smythe"".});...this causes the following exception:...  typeerror: cannot set property fullname of # which has only a getter...is this not a bug in object.assign?..full example here: https://jsfiddle.net/fa8j7p5j/"
