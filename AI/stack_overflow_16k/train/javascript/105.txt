"how does the data parameter works with this function? i wanted to modify this code into typescript because i don't know how to make a type definition file for this project (@types)..jshue repo..here's the problem,.i see there's a method for example (setlightstate) where it takes in an id and calls a network request...but in the documentation, it also passes in another argument for http body request. ..in documentation: ..user.setlightstate(3, { bri: 128 })...so i was wondering where does the second argument comes from in the js lib...the function of setlightstate(), from my understanding setlightstate, takes in a method and id then returns the url function..setlightstate: _parametrize(_put, id =&gt; `${_lighturl(id)}/state`)...and the _parametrized function confused me a lot..var _parametrize = (method, url) =&gt; (p, ...rest) =&gt; method(url(p), ...rest);"
