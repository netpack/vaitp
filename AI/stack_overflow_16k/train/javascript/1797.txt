"functions within loops, why are they considered an 'error' for complex functions declared within a loop, i can see why i wouldn't want to do this, but why would it be be considered bad blank? ..we can name the function and place it outside the loop of course, but upsets the flow for something that is simple ( no async )...eg, below is a simple inline function declaration within a loop ( jshint/lint complains, why this is considered a no no ?..for (var i = 0, len=arr.length; i &lt; len; ++i) {..     dosomething(arr[i], function(returnvalue) {.         console.log(returnvalue);.     });..};"
