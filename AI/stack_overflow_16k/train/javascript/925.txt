"simultaneous text editing with ajax? i am using a text editor called tinymce. what i'd like to do is set up a way where two or more users can edit the same blog at the same time. if one user updates a portion of the blog, this should update for all users. the simplest approach in building a system like this is to just set up an ajax query that will update for all users every second. this will create many calls to the database and possibly slow down performance. is there a better way to accomplish something like this?..currently, my database is very small. less than 10 records. it will be less than that for a long time (> 1 year)."
