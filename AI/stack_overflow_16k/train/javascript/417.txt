"why blank converts numbers in strings to numbers? i'm a complete beginner to coding. i was learning blank and came across a problem which i couldn't figure out. hope someone could explain this to me (much appreciated)...the function isnan is supposed to check whether a variable let's say is not a number. the problem is when you code like this,.. var b = ""44"" //this is  a string. if ( isnan(b) ) {. alert(""b is not a number"");  // does not give me the alert. }. //but if you put an else statement to this. else {. alert(""b is a number""); //alerts as b is a number when it's a string. }...i would really appreciate if someone could explain why this particular piece of code alerts as ""b is a number"" when it's a string. many thanks."
