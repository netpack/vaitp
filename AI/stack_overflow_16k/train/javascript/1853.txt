what advantages are gained by using constructors in blank? i'm working to refactor a large and undocumented blank library.  one of the proposed refactorings is to implement constructors in the code as opposed to dynamically constructing an object.  example below:..instead of:..var mylibobj = new object();.mylibobj.someproperty =.{.   foofunction: function(){/*do something cool*/}.}...the proposed change:..function mylibobjconstructor(){.  this.someproperty = {foofunction: function(){/*do something cool*/}}.  return this;.}..var mylibobj = new mylibobjconstructor();...is there any advantage to changing the code?
