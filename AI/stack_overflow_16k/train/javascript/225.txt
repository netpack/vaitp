"what is the full form of an expressionless statement in blank? there's a syntax that blank adopted from c where you can perform a logical check, without checking anything:..if (foo) { .}...what is this equivalent to? is it:..if (foo != null) { }.if (foo !== null) { }.if (typeof(foo) != 'undefined') { }.if (typeof(foo) !== 'undefined') { }.if (typeof(foo) != 'object') { }.if (typeof(foo) !== 'object') { }...my actual motivation for asking is wanting to ensure that a member ""exists"" (that is to say, if it is null or undefined then it doesn't exist):..if (window.devicepixelratio !== null).if (window.devicepixelratio != null).if (!(window.devicepixelratio == null)).if (!(window.devicepixelratio === null)).if (!(window.devicepixelratio == undefined)).if (!(window.devicepixelratio === undefined)).if ((window.devicepixelratio !== undefined))...my concern is if the member is defined, but defined to be null, in which case (as far as i'm concerned) it's not assigned. ..i know that the expressionless syntax returns true for a ""truthy"" value. i'm less interested in a ""truthy"" value, as an actual value."
