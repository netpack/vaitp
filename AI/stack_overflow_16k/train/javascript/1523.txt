"keep asking for a number until a even number is entered in this assignment we are to prompt for a box and type in a number. if it is  even an alert comes back and says it is even, if odd and alert comes back and says odd. i got that working, but the part that i am stuck on is we need the prompt box to keep coming back until an even number is entered. here is the code that i have used so far:..&lt;script&gt;..    var number = parseint(prompt(""please put a number between 1 and 50""));... if (number % 2 == 0) {.     alert(""your number is even!"");.}.. else {.      alert(""your number is odd!"");.  }.. &lt;/script&gt;"
