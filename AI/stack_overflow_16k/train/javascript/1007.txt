"turning an array of values and strings into an if statement in blank i have an array like this:..[true, ""&amp;&amp;"", false]..the true and false statements are generated by previous conditions and pushed onto an array (i'm trying to provide users with a way to create basic logic themselves within my web project)...what i can't figure out is how to turn this array into an actual if statement that runs like this:..if(true &amp;&amp; false) {. // run code.}...note that depending on what the user setup the array could look like this:..[true, ""||"", false]..if(true || false) {.  // run code.}...i want to allow the array to also allow parentheses:..[""("", true, ""&amp;&amp;"", false, "")"", ""||"", true]..should become:..if( (true &amp;&amp; false) || true) {.  // run code.}"
