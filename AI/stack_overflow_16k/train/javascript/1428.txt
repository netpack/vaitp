"js date too much clever behavior i encounter problem when parsing date via native js date object...new date(""i'm really clever date 8745"")...this expression returns valid date which was pretty shocking for me. how to prevent this special behavior ?..edit: date interprets last number as year .....edit: chrome, version (48.0.2564.116)..edit: expected format is ""2016-03-20t18:05:53.485z"" (json stringify)"
