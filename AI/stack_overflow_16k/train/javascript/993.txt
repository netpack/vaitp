"blank function using objects i am designing a sort of game where there are team bases that surround a hexagonal board. the idea is that when a team base is clicked, it will be that team's turn. i have:..    $('.team').click(function(){.        var teamid=$(this).attr('id');.        explore(teamid);.    });...i then use the teamid to find the index of the team that was clicked, which is stored as an object from a json file with attributes such as teamname, score, etc...    function explore(index){         // the game portion.        var turn=file[index];        // finds the team's info from json file.        $('.hex').click(function(){  // when a hex is clicked.... play the game.            alert(turn.teamname);       .            // game elements .    }...this always works the first time around, however if i click on a different team box and then a hex, oftentimes it thinks that it is the turn of the box i clicked before. i added the alert(turn.teamname) to try to debug. if i'm clicking a different box, it will always alert the first box, and then send a second alert with the different box. i can't figure out why there would be two alerts? so it will always alert 'team1' and then 'team1','team2'. as i click more boxes it keeps alerting until it just alerts all of them. additionally, if i have clicked more than two boxes before, even if i keep clicking the same hex it seems like it alternates between alerting me that it is 'team1' and 'team2'...this is my first stackoverflow post so i hope it makes sense! thanks!"
