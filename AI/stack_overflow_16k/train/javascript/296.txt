"how can i handle daylight savings time when trying to pull the first day of a month? if i try to pull first day number from november, this works fine:..var d = new date(2013, 10, 1);    // 1st of november 2013.d.toisostring();                  // 2013-11-01t00:00:00.000z (november).d.getday();                      // 5 (correct, 1st of november = friday = 5)...however due to daylight savings time in the uk (the clocks going forward by one hour at the end of october), if i try to pull the first day of october, the date ends up being set to 23:00 on the previous day:..var d = new date(2013, 9, 1);     // 1st of october 2013.d.toisostring();                  // 2013-09-30t23:00:00.000z (september).d.getday();                      // 2 (last day number of september)...how can i handle this so that i always get 00:00:00 on the 1st of the month, regardless of daylight savings time (and any other clock adjustments wherever a user may be in the world)?"
