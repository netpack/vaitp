"how to write blank with factory functions i'm reading this article about perils of trying to mimic oop in blank and there's the following:...  in blank, factory functions are simply constructor functions.  minus the new requirement, global pollution danger and awkward.  limitations (including that annoying initial capitalized letter.  convention). .  .  blank doesn’t need constructor functions because any.  function can return a new object. with dynamic object extension,.  object literals and object.create(), we have everything we.  need — with none of the mess. and this behaves just like it does in.  any other function. hurray!...am i right to assume that given this approach we should replace this code:..function rabbit() {.    this.speed = 3;.}..rabbit.prototype = {.    this.getspeed = function() {.        return this.speed;.    }.}..var rabbit = new rabbit();...with this:..function rabbitfactory() {.    var rabbit = {.        speed: 3.    };..    object.setprototypeof(rabbit, {.        getspeed: function() {.            return this.speed;.        }.    })..    return rabbit;.}..var rabbit = rabbitfactory();"
