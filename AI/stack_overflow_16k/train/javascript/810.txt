scope at let to a if statement lots of times i am needing to delcare a variable just for a truthy if statement. .for example:..let entry;.entry = entries.find(....);.if (entry) {.   // use entry.}..// i dont need entry here...i tried combintations similar to for (let i=0; ...) like this:..if (let entry = entries.find(....)) {.   // user entry.}...but it's not working. if i use var instead of let it works but the variable it hoisted so its not limited to that if statement block.
