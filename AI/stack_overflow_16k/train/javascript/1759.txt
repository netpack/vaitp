"translate algebraic expressions into programming i am looking at algebra and trying to find methods to translate expressions into programming loops.....the simple version of this center of gravity equation (as i understand) would be to find a single value from a data set...sudo code:..var price=[];//array of imaginary numbers..var i=price.length;..var s1     = 0.0,.    s2     = 0.0,.    answer = 0.0;..while(i--){..   s1 += (i+1) * price[i];..   s2 += price[i];..   if(!i){answer = s2/s1;}.   }...in the expression Ïƒ (sigma) is the instruction to sum up where n would be the number of times and i is the iteration...why is the i in (i+1) shown as an x in the expression?"
