"js get length of words separated by comma + last word i have an input with this string ..one, two, three...i'm getting the total number of words separated by comma:..val = $(""input"").val().replace("" "", """");.words = val.split("","");.count = words.length;...it returns 2 but there is one more word three. there is no comma after it so it is not being split/counted...how can i include the last word in the length?..also what if i have a single word with no comma after it?..one...it should return 1. ..note: i'm getting the word length live from the input as i type, using keyup, keypress. not sure if that matters or not."
