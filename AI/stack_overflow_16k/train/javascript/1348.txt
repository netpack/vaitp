"is it possible to resize an image in the browser without adding it to the dom i read an image using the filereader api, then i store the image as a blob in indexeddb for later synchronization with a server. until then i want to display a thumbnail of the image. it seems suboptimal to add the image ie. to a canvas element in full resolution and then resize it. it seems a better solution would be to resize it before adding it...after synchronization i want to delete the full resolution image and only show the thumbnail. (my main concern is storage limits in a web app, on a mobile device)..is it possible? and how?"
