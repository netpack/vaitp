"i am trying to figure out how to make my functions run one after another... but it is not working i am trying to create a very simple text based adventure game using blank. i am very new and i feel this would be a great was to work with some of the functions, variables, and if-else statements. i have written some code to prompt the screen to ask for age, and give a result. ..confirm(""ready to play?"");.var age = prompt(""how old are you?"");.if (age &gt;= 18) {.    document.write("" ""); .} else {.    document.write(""you're less than 18? you better just stay home."");.}..document.write(""&lt;button&gt; sounds like you're ready.&lt;/button&gt;"");..var gender = prompt(""male"",""female"");.if(gender = ""male"") {.    document.write(""sounds good!"");.} else if(gender = ""female"") {.    document.write(""sounds good!"");.} else if {.    document.write(""you're a damn liar"");.    };.}; ...if i run just the top half of the code, everything will run just fine. but if i try to run the gender prompt, alongside the original code, it will run nothing. any suggestions?"
