"for-loop setting length variable when converting from nodelist phew! that was a long title...i'm reading wrox' book on professional blank for web developers and i came across this sample code, and i was just wondering if that was best practice:..function converttoarray(nodes) {.   array = new array();.   for (var i=0, len=nodes.length; i &lt; len; i++) {.      array.push(nodes[i]);.   }.   return array;.}...the thing that's got me scratching my head is the ""len=nodes.length"". am i wrong in thinking that the first sentence in a for-loop is only run once? is there a reason you'd want to set a variable (len) to the length of the nodelist before running through it? would you do that to a normal array as well?..thanks"
