"how to target an option from pull down with js to apply more code a friend asked me to help him with a form, a client of his wants to make a form a bit more dynamic...my blank is minimal at best since i just started learning...he asked me something along the lines of "" how can i make a form show another pull down only when a certain option is selected ""..in the example he gave me, by default when page loads,he has a pull down menu which has 2 options, manhattan and option two is brooklyn...if manhattan is chose, that reveals another pull down with zips for manhattan, if brooklyn is chosen the same for bk...in sample html, something along the lines like this:..&lt;div&gt;..&lt;form&gt;.    &lt;select name=""boro"" id=""boro""&gt;.        &lt;option value=""manhattan"" id=""manh""&gt;manhattan&lt;/option&gt;.        &lt;option value=""brooklyn"" id=""brook""&gt;brooklyn&lt;/option&gt;.    &lt;/select&gt;.&lt;/form&gt;..&lt;br/&gt;..&lt;div id=""empty2fill""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- for showing chosen results --&gt;..&lt;/div&gt;...i want to target/capture the option chosen by the user above on the pull down menu, to then activate this function(below)...according to his request what i guess id do is,(as a newbie), then as far as the .js goes (pseudo code):..&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;.function valboro (){.    if( brook is chosen){ document.getelementbyid('empty2fill').innerhtml="" new dropdown code here"")..    }..}..&lt;/script&gt;...aside from not knowing, my main problem is i dont know how to target the option chosen in the menu to thereafter, apply the function (which will be written later)..any ideas, tips etc are greately appreciated..thanks in advance"
