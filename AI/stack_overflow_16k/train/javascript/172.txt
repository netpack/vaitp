"default parseint radix to 10 one of the bad parts of blank is that if you use parseint with something that begins with 0, then it could see the number as a octal...i = parseint(014); // answer: 12...q: how can i redefine parseint so that it defaults to radix 10?  i'm assuming you would use the prototype method...edit:..maybe i should do this:..$.fn.extend({.    parseint:function(x) {.        return parseint(x,10);.    }.});"
