determing the type of the return value i get a return value from a function which is always string. i used typeof(obj) which turns out to be string always...date.functionname=date.prototype.functionname=function(dataobj) {.        //the dataobj is always string. .            // how can i differentiate between the values... .};...i have three things coming as strings.....date.string... .integer values... ...all the three are of type string....how can i differentiate these three values..is it correct to use date.mycustomfunction... or should i use some.other class...
