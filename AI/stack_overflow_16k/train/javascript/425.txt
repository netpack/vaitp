"multiple redirects for multiple alerts let me start by saying that i'm not an expert when it comes to blank, but i've done my research and can't quite figure out what i'm doing wrong with my code. for my webpage, i've been editing a reflex related game that basically has four different alerts, based off of how quickly they press the stop button...here's part of my code, which will show my redirect pages, which i'm not currently being redirected to. no matter which alert you receive, it takes you to the very last one which makes me wonder where i went wrong...function remark(responsetime) {.    var responsestring = """";.    if (responsetime &lt; 0.20) responsestring = ""well done!."";.    window.location.href = ""dfgr454.php"";.    if (responsetime &gt;= 0.20 &amp;&amp; responsetime &lt; 0.40) responsestring = ""nice."";.    window.location.href = ""fdkjgtry5.php"";.    if (responsetime &gt;= 0.40 &amp;&amp; responsetime &lt; 0.60) responsestring = ""could be better. "";.    window.location.href = ""dfg5654f.php"";.    if (responsetime &gt;= 0.60 &amp;&amp; responsetime &lt; 0.80) responsestring = ""that's no good."";.    window.location.href = ""bvcb56.php"";.    if (responsetime &gt;= 0.80 &amp;&amp; responsetime &lt; 1) responsestring = ""have you been drinking?"";.    window.location.href = ""dfgf643re.php"";.    if (responsetime &gt;= 1) responsestring = ""did you fall asleep?"";.    return responsestring;.}...if it helps (and i'm no entirely sure it will, since it didn't help me), when i edited my code to try window.open instead, all of them opened at once. is there any way to stop this from happening? the alerts are coming up fine, but i want them to redirect to the specific window.location i'm trying to pair with them. please and thank you, any suggestions would be perfect!"
