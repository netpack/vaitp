"how to convert an undetermined number of input strings? i'm writing some code to convert some input names(ex: john doe -> j. doe) without knowing the length of the inputted name(could be john williams roger fred doe, that would be j. w. r. f. doe).  ..i figured out the algorithm for the 2 names input but i can't find an efficient way to cover the rest of the cases. the only way that comes to my mind is wrapping the rest of the cases up to 10 names in some if statements. is there any other efficient way to do it? thanks in advance!..function convertname(name) {.    var [a, b] = name.split("" "");.    var c = `${a[0]}${"". ""}${b}`;.    return c;.    }"
