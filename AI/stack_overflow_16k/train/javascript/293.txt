"blank will not load after dom i'm having trouble getting my js to run after all my content has loaded. right now on the site im working on: http://hsvgridproject.com, the grid will not load the first time a user visit the site and needs a hard refresh before it will work. i believe i need to use a window.onload function of some sort but as i am still learning java i'm not sure how to implement it into my project without breaking the code. ..the script for the grid on homepage has a window tag surrounding it already (credit codrops):..(function(window) {...please let me know if you need more info. thank you!"
