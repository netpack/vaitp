"generate a list of all possible variations of an array of objects in blank note: this question is different than other permutation questions because it's an array of objects and not an array of integers...i have an array of objects like this:..var options = .[.    {.        name: ""size"",.        choices: [.            {.                label: ""small"",.                price: 0.            },.            {.                label: ""medium"",.                price: 10.            }.        ].    },.    {.        name: ""color"",.        choices: [.            {.                label: ""yellow"",.                price: 0.            },.            {.                label: ""purple"",.                price: 10.            }.        ].    }.]...i want to make a function that generates all possible variations into an object like this:..{.    ""size-small--color-yellow"": {.        label: ""size: small, color: yellow"",.        choices: {.            size: {.                label: ""small"",.                price: 0.            },.            color: {.                label: ""yellow"",.                price: 0,.            }.        },.    },.    ""size-small--color-purple"": {.        label: ""size: small, color: purple"",.        choices: {.            size: {.                label: ""small"",.                price: 0.            },.            color: {.                label: ""purple"",.                price: 10,.            }.        },.    },.    ""size-medium--color-yellow"": {.        label: ""size: medium, color: yellow"",.        choices: {.            size: {.                label: ""medium"",.                price: 10.            },.            color: {.                label: ""yellow"",.                price: 0,.            }.        },.    },.    ""size-medium--color-purple"": {.        label: ""size: medium, color: purple"",.        choices: {.            size: {.                label: ""medium"",.                price: 10.            },.            color: {.                label: ""purple"",.                price: 10,.            }.        },.    }.}...the real array of objects is much larger which a lot more options and choices, so the solution would need to work with various array sizes, from small like this to very large sets of options...here is what i tried so far:..function generatevariations() {.    var variations = {};..    for(var i in options) {.      var option = options[i];.      var key = '';.      var keyarray = [];.      for(var j in option.choices) {.        var choice = option.choices[j];.        console.log(choice, 'choice value');..        keyarray.push(option.name + '-' + choice.label).      }..      key = keyarray.join('--');..      console.log(key, 'key made for object');..      variations[key] = {}; // todo: after generating all of the keys, assign them correct values..    }..    return variations;.}...i'm having trouble wrapping my head around the recursive aspect of this, since there could potentially be unlimited numbers of variations, not sure if it needs recursion or not."
