"check if document.getelementbyid does not exist? i've been looking at the tutorial here:..https://www.detectadblock.com/..this is the blank they use to detect is adblock is enabled:..if(document.getelementbyid('apvpifbtxbcq')){.  alert('blocking ads: no');.} else {.  alert('blocking ads: yes');.}...i don't have any code that needs to be run if someone is not blocking ads...so, this line is basically useless to me:..alert('blocking ads: no');...what would i need to change to remove that part and basically do this?..if(document.getelementbyid('apvpifbtxbcq') is not set){.  alert('ads are being blocked.');.}"
