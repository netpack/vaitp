"a tiny ""guess the number"" game doesn't work as intended i tried to make a silly little game in blank where you're prompted to guess a number between 1-10. the computer then randomly picks a number and if it's the same as you guessed it says ""you guessed right!"", else ""try again!""...however, the computer input and the user input is never the same!.what am i doing wrong?..var userchoice = prompt(""make a guess from 1 to 10"");.var computerchoice = math.random();..if (computerchoice &lt; 0.1) {.    computerchoice = 1;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.2){.    computerchoice = 2;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.3){.    computerchoice = 3;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.4){.    computerchoice = 4;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.5){.   computerchoice = 5;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.6){.    computerchoice = 6;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.7){.    computerchoice = 7;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.8){.    computerchoice = 8;.}.else if (computerchoice &lt; 0.9){.    computerchoice = 9;.}.else {.    computerchoice = 10;.}..var compare = function(choice1, choice2){.    if (choice1 === choice2){.        console.log(""you guessed right!"");.    }.    else{.        console.log(""try again!"");.    }.};..compare(userchoice, computerchoice);"
