"can two people work on the same blank project simultaneously? me and my friend have this develop a game in 18 hour competition on friday, and we have to use blank (i don't know why) and it isn't very pleasant to work on the same project from two computers and exchange code over a network share folder, is there any way to have a sort of google docs for blank coding? where we can both edit the same document in real time from two different computers? any time appreciated."
