"how to change element text on mouse click so, i'm new to this kind of stuff, and i have a question. i found this code for picking a random word, but not picking it again until all the word have been picked...function shuffle(array).{.  var m = array.length, t, i;.  while (m &gt; 0) .  {.    i = math.floor(math.random() * m--);.    t = array[m];.    array[m] = array[i];.    array[i] = t;.  }.  return array;.}..var keywords = [""cheese"", ""apples"", ""grapes"", ""chicken"", ""potatoes"", ""beef"", ""bananas""];..shuffle(keywords); // shuffles the array..alert(keywords);...and that brought up a question. how can i trigger this when a white box, posing as a card, has been clicked? i would like a box to display only one of the values at any one time, and randomly pick another word when clicked, using this code...any help is super very much appreciated."
