"blank array index test if i have an array myarray which i am looping through:..for(var i=0;i&lt;myarray.length;i++) {.   if(myarray[i] == myarray[i+1]).      //do something.}...clearly, myarray[i+1] will fail on the last iteration.  short of testing if i == (myarray.length - 1), is there a clean way to not fail on that if statement and just have it evaluate to false (if myarray[i+1] is out of bounds)?"
