"is there a better way to return an object if it exists in blank? i have a function that searches for images in different ways, one by one, and for each trial, if it finds one, the function returns that image. ..the code becomes quite clunky if i search for various images, is there a more elegant way of trying to find an object and returning it if it exists?..var image = $('a.jqzoom')[0].getattribute('href');.if (image).    return image;...then, i keep trying other ways to find images one after the other, for example:..var image = $('a.asdf')[0].getattribute('href');.if (image).    return image;"
