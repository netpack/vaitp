"is this the correct way to wrap readfilesync in a promise the reason for the below code is to get rid of callback hell/pyramid of doom. i don't fully understand i/o blocking though yet...'use strict';..var fs = require('fs');.var co = require('co');..co(function* () {..    var filename = 'readme.txt';..    var str =.        yield new promise(function (resolve, reject) {.            var result;.            try {.                result = fs.readfilesync(filename, 'utf8');.            } catch (err) {.                reject(err);.            }.            resolve(result);.        });.    console.log('result readfilesync: ' + str);..});...all i'm expecting is a yes or no answer to be honest. hope fully if no could someone give some details as i'm trying to learn properly about blank sync/async and how to harness the power of promises."
