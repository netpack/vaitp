"how are blank objects converted to strings when using string addition? when i log something like console.log('' + {}); the console would print [object object] in chrome, but something different ({}) in node. at this point i would have thought that the console output depends on the execution environment...however, recently i discovered that, given some not-null object foo, i somehow had chrome print null instead of the expected output above. so using console.log('' + foo); resulted in null in the console. how is that possible? my first guess was that i must have overridden something important accidentally, like some tostring() method. otherwise i could not explain why chrome would interpret some not-null object as null when it is added to a string...does anyone know how that implicit object-to-string conversion actually works? it is not that this is a show-stopper, but it really makes me wonder...edit: i did not include a jsfiddle because this occurs in some quite dependency-heavy class, so there is no proper minimal working example i could offer you. the question does not refer to my code anyway, it is rather basic and technical...another edit: for the sake of completeness, i am adding the screenshot i posted in the comments."
