"blank use constructor parameters in methods, which way is valid? i have js object like this:..var dog = function(dogname) {.  this.bark = function() {.    console.log(dogname + "" is barking"");.  }.}...and ..var dog = function(dogname) {.  this.dogname = dogname;.  this.bark = function() {.    console.log(this.dogname + "" is barking"");.  }.}...i can use both the same way:..var puppy = new dog(""ringo"");.puppy.bark();...my question is is there any practical difference between those two approaches? is it better to assign constructor parameters to this.&lt;field&gt;, or i can just utilize those parameters straight away as they are accessible to inner functions? are there any special cases for both?"
