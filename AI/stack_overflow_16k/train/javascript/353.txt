"reference a website within blank is there any way that i can reference a given website without physically loading it? for example, if i wanted to search yahoo's front page for the text “bananas”…..var site = (location.href =""http://yahoo.com"");.var arraycontainsturtles = (site.indexof(""bananas"") &gt; -1);.window.prompt(arraycontainsturtles)...this will load yahoo, and then pop up with a prompt saying true or false. how would i acquire this behavior without physically loading yahoo, and instead just having the prompt say true or false?"
