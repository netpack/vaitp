"blank date comparison oddity i have an issue with blank date comparison.  i create a date object for 31st oct, and another for 1st nov, yet gettime() for each returns the same figure, and the greater-than / less-than operators also consider the dates equal.  here is my code:..d1 = new date(2012, 10, 31, 0, 0, 0, 0);.d2 = new date(2012, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);.document.write(d1.gettime() + ""&lt;br /&gt;"");.document.write(d2.gettime() + ""&lt;br /&gt;"");.document.write((d1 &lt; d2) + ""&lt;br /&gt;"");.document.write((d1 &gt; d2) + ""&lt;br /&gt;"");...and here is the output:..1354320000000.1354320000000.false.false...the same code works fine around other month endings, it seems to be just these two dates that cause an issue...any help appreciated!"
