"what's substantive difference between function and object in blank? when i learn js at first i get a voice which say everything is an object, so i think maybe function is an object and object is an object too...but when i learn prototype, some thing different to my thought...function helloworld(){                                                                       .    this.hi = 'world';.}.var foo = { .    'sth':'happend'.};...function bar(){};..bar.prototype = foo;.console.log(new bar().sth);..bar.prototype = helloworld;.console.log(new bar().hi);...and i get print..happend.undefined...then i replace bar.prototype = helloworld; to bar.prototype = new helloworld();  i get correct result...happend.world...i'm a newbie, maybe it's a stupid question, but i really want to know what's wrong in my mind?  is function not an object?  could anybody help me?  thanks a lot.."
