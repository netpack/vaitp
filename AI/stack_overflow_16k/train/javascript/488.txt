"blank, prototype and inherit i've this code:..var parent = function(){};.var child = function(){};..function inherit(c, p){.    c.prototype = new p();//received a pointer to parent.    c.prototype.test = function(){};.}..inherit(child, parent);.console.log(new parent);//object {}.console.log(new child);//object {test=function()}...now i've a question, if c.prototype received a pointer to parent in my inherit function, why my ""console.log(new parent)"" doesn't show like this: ""object {test=function()}"" to parent and ""object {}"" to child?"
