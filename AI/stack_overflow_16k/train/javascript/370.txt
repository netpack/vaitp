"how to use a named function with for each and this i have found that not using anonymous functions has made my code more readable and self-documenting by flattening the code into more understandable, standalone functions.  so i'd like to break out the following construct from:..function save() {.   myval = 3.14 // some arbitrary value.   $('#myid').each(function(index,element) {.      if ($(this).val() === myval) {}.   });.}...into:..function save() {.   myval = 3.14 // some arbitrary value.   $('#myid').each(myfunction);.}..function myfunction(index,element) {.   if ($(this).val() === myval) {}.}...the problem with using .bind here, is that you lose the value of $(this) inside the each method, so (i don't think) i can bind myval to myfunction...maybe i could use element instead of this?..edit 1: i should have used .myclass instead of #myid for an example selector...edit 2: i'm not using bind in the proposed solution because i don't think bind would work...edit 3: i appreciate everyone saying that the first example is more readable.  i'm just exploring the language and trying out different thoughts."
