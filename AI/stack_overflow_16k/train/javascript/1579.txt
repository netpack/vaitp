"accessing sub-elements of an array (blank) i have an array called shopping list with elements containing the name of the product and its amount. using the method .map i want to make a new array called product that only includes the product names from these elements. so that the new array would look like ['milk', 'coffee', 'bananas', 'bread']...let shoppinglist = [ ['milk', 1], ['coffee', 2], ['bananas'], ['bread', 1] ];..const product = shoppinglist.map();...what do i put in after shoppinglist.map?"
