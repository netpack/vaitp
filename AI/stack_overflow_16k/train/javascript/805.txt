"how to get multiple strings into one case in java script? so i've been using switch statements, and was wondering if there is a way to get several strings into one case, instead of only one string per case...for example:..switch(fruits) {.case 'apples','bananas','oranges','strawberries':..//i'd like to get those four  fruits into one case, instead of doing this:   .switch (fruits) {.    case 'apples':.    break;.    case 'bananas':.    break;.    case 'oranges':.     break;.     case 'strawberries':...if this can be done it will save me a lot of time."
