"why are these loops different? i was working on my site at work, when i encountered  something strange, i'm fetching data from a database via ajax, and then i uses some loops to update the data in a table. here is my first attempt at the loop..for(var id in data){.    for(var key in data[id]).        for(var e in document.getelementsbyname(key+id)).            e.innerhtml = data[id][key] !== null ? data[id][key] : """";...i expected that to work without a problem, but it doesn't. none of the fields in the table gets updated, and i have no idea why. then i decided to test with something more traditional, and ended up with this...for(var id in data){.    for(var key in data[id]){.        var temp = document.getelementsbyname(key+id);.        for(var i=0; i&lt;temp.length; i++).            temp[i].innerhtml = data[id][key] !== null ? data[id][key] : """";.    }...that worked prefect, but i don't understand why, since from what i can see, the loops should do the same thing. so i wonder, why are they different, and how can i fix it. i like consistencies in my codes, and don't want to use the for(var i=0; i&lt;temp.length; i++) since i used the other types of loops earlier."
