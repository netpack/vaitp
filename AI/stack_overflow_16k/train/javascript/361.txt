"i can't make these few simple line of code work correctly and have no idea why i tried to this simple exercise , i did get it to work but not correctly. it's supposed to give you a random number between 0 and 1000 as you click a button. when you click the button again , it creates another random number , if its bigger than the last one , it displays it. if it is not , it does nothing. and while it does this , it counts how many times it had run the function..the one i made did give me random numbers but sometimes , it displayed smaller numbers than the last one and sometimes it didn't. i can't figure out why. i suspect it might be because of the line of code where i tried to change what the button does...&lt;!doctype html&gt;.&lt;html&gt;.&lt;head&gt;.&lt;input id=""btn"" type=""button"" onclick=""initiate(1)"" value=""click me!""&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;script&gt;.function geid(id) {.    return document.getelementbyid(id);.}.var count = 0;..function initiate(n) {.    var x = n;.    n = math.floor(math.random() * 1000);.    document.getelementbyid(""btn"").onclick = function () {.        initiate(n);.    }..    if (n &gt; x) {.        geid(""fid"").innerhtml = n;.        count += 1;.        geid(""fid2"").innerhtml = count + "" times"";..    } else {.        count += 1;.        geid(""fid2"").innerhtml = count + "" times"";..    }.}.&lt;/script&gt;..&lt;/head&gt;..&lt;body&gt;.number : &lt;div id=""fid""&gt;0&lt;/div&gt;.tried &lt;div id=""fid2""&gt;0&lt;/div&gt;..&lt;/body&gt;..&lt;/html&gt;"
