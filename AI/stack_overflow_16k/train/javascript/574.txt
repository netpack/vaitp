"date difference in blank i am developing a system which requires that you should be at least 18 years old to register. ..for doing this validation i have implemented date difference in blank in following way, but it is not accurate, is there any blank function or other way to do this?..var d1=new date(1985,1,28);.var d2=new date();.var milli=d2-d1;.var milliperyear=1000*60*60*24*365.26;.var years_old=milli/milliperyear;"
