"order mouseup event this is a theoretical question... i have two mouseup events. one of them is fired from a external jquery plugin developed by other people that i'm using, this event is bound in this way:..//add events for mouse drag / touch swipe action.$(document).bind(self.event_up + self.id, { self: self }, self.mouseup);...the other mouse up event, it's fired by me, using the standard code, something like this:..$(document).mouseup(function (e) {..}..});...my question is easy, sometimes one event is fired before the other, and sometimes the other event is fired before the other one...can somebody explain me if i have any options to bind the mouseup event in some order?"
