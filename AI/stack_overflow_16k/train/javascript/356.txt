"refresh all images on page i'm using the following script to update images on a page displaying webcams. the webcam images are pulled by ftp. because i want to implement a filtering interface, using mixitup, i don't want the whole page to refresh as this will clear any filters...so the above script does work... kind of. the problem here is that eventually the image url will become too long and won't display...does any one have a suggestion on how this can be resolved?..cheers!..function imgrefresh() {.  var now = new date();.  for (i = 0; i &lt; document.images.length; i++) {.    document.images[i].src = document.images[i].src + ""?"" + now.gettime();.  }.  settimeout('imgrefresh()', 5 * 1000);.}"
