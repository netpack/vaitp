"jquery perform another function in last ""for"" run i have js objects and a function as follow:..function my_function(data){.    var cont = []; .    for (var i = 0; i &lt; (data.length); i++) {                   .       var info     = data[i];  .       var r_id     = info['id'];.       cont.unshift(r_id);  //example: [12,158,125,126,126].    };  .    //i need to save the last id (in this case, 126) as `saved_id` to be used in another function                   .};  ..var saved_id;...now, i need to save the last number (in this case, 126) as a separate variable (as saved_id) to be used in another function.      ..how would i do this so that when the for function runs and if it is the last run, then it performs another function (in this case, updates the saved_id variable with the last id number)?"
