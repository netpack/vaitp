"is placing blank directly on html document deprecated? i am shocked to read the following from quirksmode:...  deprecated: direct blanks.  .  do not use direct blanks for the reasons explained in section 2c.  of the book. this section is only maintained for historical reasons..  .  the simplest method is to place your scripts directly in the page. how.  to place..&lt;script language=""blank"" type=""text/blank""&gt;.&lt;!--..script goes here..// --&gt;.&lt;/script&gt;....based on my understanding reading the article, blanks are to be included using the src attribute on &lt;script&gt; tags instead. i don't have the book and can't find further references online that says this. does anyone know whether this is correct or did i misinterpret what it is trying to say?"
