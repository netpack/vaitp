"how to declare global variables when using the strict mode pragma it's considered good practice to use a self-invoking function to wrap strict mode compliant code, often called the strict mode pragma:..(function(){.  ""use strict"";.  // strict code here.}());...my question is how to declare global variables in this case? three alternatives that i know of today:..alternative 1:..var glob = {};..(function(){.  ""use strict"";.}());...alternative 2:..(function(){.  ""use strict"";.  window.glob = {};.}());...alternative 3:..(function(win){.  ""use strict"";.  win.glob = {};.}(window));...any preferences and motivations? other options?"
