"passing objects and id as parameters in a function working on some code and i'm running into an issue i don't know how to fix using blank...i have days that is a collection of objects that look like:..day: 1.a: 10.b: 5.c: 9.d: 6 ...and so forth...what i want to do is have a function that i can pass days and one of the id's for a, b, c, d and have it do 'something'. (by something, i'm not sure yet)...i'm just struggling to figure out how to pass the identifier...function returnall(data, id){.   for (var day in data){.    console.log('on day' + day + ' , ' + id + ' has a value of ' data[day].id).   }.}...which would ideally put something like this into the console:.    on day 1 , a has a value of ....    on day 2,  a has a value of .....when returnall(days, a) is called,  i just can't get the id to link up properly inside of the function. i'll need to call this function for either a, b, c...the days can be dynamic so i need a function that operates just on the values of the id passed as the parameter...any thoughts?"
