"how would you make it so a parent's values wouldn't for an inherited object so i have this code which inherits :..enemy = new object(hawk);...the parent is this:..function createenemy(name, health, damage){.    this.name = name;.    this.health = health;.    this.damage = damage;.}..var hawk = new createenemy(""hawk"", 200, 20);...whenever i do ..enemy.health -= 10;...it changes the value of hawk.health as well, and i don't want it to do that."
