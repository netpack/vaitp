"script for browser detection and url linking i'm new... i'm looking for a script that detects the browser and then a function that links to a specific url based on the browser being used. i'm stuck on how to combine two functions into one js file. using the onclick method to call one of the two functions. does this make sense? what are my options. i know useragent is frowned upon, what are the work arounds?"
