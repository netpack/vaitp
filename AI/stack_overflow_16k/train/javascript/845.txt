"can anyone tell me why this loop isn't working as it should? this is for an exercise on codewars.com. the idea is to make a function that takes an array as the first parameter, then deletes each item in sequence defined by the second parameter, so if the second parameter is 3, it'll delete 3 first(counting for this one is supposed to be 1 based, not 0 based), then 6, then 9, then back around to 2, as though all the items were in a circle, then 7 (because 3 and 6 are gone), etc, then return the items in the order in which they were deleted (this pattern is referred to as a josephus permutation)...so here's my code:....function josephus(items, k) {.  var arr = [];.  var l = items.length;.  var a = k - 1;.  for (var i = 0; i &lt; l; i++) {.    arr.push(items[a]);.    items.splice(a, 1);.    a += k - 1 ;.    if (a &gt;= items.length) { a = a - items.length; }.  }.  return arr;.}.....it works sometimes. it worked right with josephus([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 1), but then with josephus([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 2), it worked until the last number(5, in this case), then returned null. in fact, most times, it returns null in the place of the last item. can anyone tell me why it's doing this? if you have a codewars account, you can try it out in its context here: http://www.codewars.com/kata/5550d638a99ddb113e0000a2/train/blank"
