"what syntax error am i getting in writing a simple for loop in the blank console? i am trying to practice some blank on the chrome blank console. .i read up on the the syntax of blank's for loop http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp and saw that it was nearly identical to java's. .here is the simple for loop i tried running on the console. ..for(int count = 0; count &lt; 10; count ++ ) { alert(""hi""); }...and the syntax error i am getting..uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected identifier...does anyone know why this syntax error is occuring. it can't be because of alert because i tested that and read that that was the function to use to pop up an alert box. alert blank..and nothing on here https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console suggests that you can't run for loops in the console."
