"should you use ""this"" or refer directly to the parent object in blank? there are some cases in my program where you could either use ""this"" or just directly refer to the parent object (let's call this parent) to carry out the same function...let parent = {};..parent.func = function (foo) {.  this.bar = foo; // option 1.  parent.bar = foo; // option 2.}...is there any reason, perhaps efficiency or just code convention, to use one of the options over the other?..for example, does the ""this"" keyword take more/less time to reference than parent, or is this negligible? or do people generally see using ""this"" in an example like the one given as bad practice or harder to read (or the opposite)?"
