"i want one button to switch between two functions based on time? what i have is a simple website where you input a number and when you click a button it divdes it by 16 and the answer pops up. but what i want to do is divide it by either 16 or 11 based on the time the button is clicked like if its earlier than 10:00 then it would divded it by 11 and anything later it would divide by 16...button.addeventlistener('click', (e) =&gt; {.    if (!hassubmitted) {.      hassubmitted = true.      result.classlist.remove('hidden').    }.    value.value = number(input.value / 16).}) ...how do i make both functions work on the same button. i have no idea what to try since im totally new to blank."
