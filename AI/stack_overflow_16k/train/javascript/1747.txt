"settimeout in for-loop prints unexpected garbage value for the first time when run in console window ..for (let i=1; i&lt;=5; i++) {.      settimeout( function timer(){.        console.log( i );.      }, i*1000 );.    }.....the above works in this snippet, but when ran in the console window i get unexpected results. the first value is garbage. what is the reason behind the first garbage value that gets printed?"
