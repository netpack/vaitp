"blank controllers new audio tag so i have the blank code working so it plays the first file then second. however the issue is i now can't pause the second file without the first file replying?..i am wondering how do you correctly set controllers to the following code.. var audio = new audio(""file 1"");.          audio.play();.          audio.addeventlistener('ended',function(){.               audio.id = ""stream"";.               audio.src = ""file2"";.               audio.load();.               audio.play();.               //alert(""it should be playing"");.         });"
