"removing duplicate elements in two arrays while assigning a greater score i have 2 arrays which contains objects as follows. ..var arrayl = {. 1: {url:google.com, score:0},. 2: {url:bing.com, score: 2},. 3: {url:yahoo.com, score: 0},. 4: {url:facebook.com, score: 5},. 5: {url:dopgile.com, score: 1},. 6: {url:ask.com, score: 10}, . 7: {url:duckduckgo.com, score: 10}.},..array2 = {. 1: {url:google.com, score: 2},. 2: {url:facebook.com, score: 3}, . 3: {url:twitter.com, score: 0},. 4: {url:duckduckgo.com, score: 0},. 5: {url:mamma.com, score: 4},. 6: {url:myspace.com, score: 5}.}; ...array 1 and array 2 both have unique elements within themselves. however there are duplicates among them. ..i want to merge array 2 with array 1 in such a way as to increase the score of the duplicate element in array 1 by 1 when it occurs...for example, google.com is present in array 2 and array 1. when the merging process begins, it increases the score of the first element of array 1 which is google.com to 1 instead of 0. it shouldn't add the first element of array2 to it since it is a duplicate. ..similarly, the elements 2,3,5,6 will be merged without increasing any scores as there isn't a duplicate in the array1. howevever, duckduckgo is a duplicate and will increase the score of duckduckgo.com in array1[7] to 11 and not add it to the array...finally, the array should be:..var arrayl = {. 1: {url:google.com, score:1},. 2: {url:bing.com, score: 2},. 3: {url:yahoo.com, score: 0},. 4: {url:facebook.com, score: 5},. 5: {url:dopgile.com, score: 1},. 6: {url:ask.com, score: 10}, . 7: {url:duckduckgo.com, score: 11}. 8: {url:facebook.com, score: 3}, . 9: {url:twitter.com, score: 0},. 10: {url:mamma.com, score: 4},. 11: {url:myspace.com, score: 5}...},..i have tried going through the array with the following loops. ..for(var j=0; j&lt;10;j++) {. for(var k=0; k&lt;10; k++) {.  if(array1[k].url==array2[j].url){..   array1[k].changerankscore(array1[k].score+1);..  }else{.   //this is the case where it is not the same. ideally i should just push it to array1    but since it's a double loops, finally all the items will be added from array2 to array1 with several duplicates. .  }. }.}...help please."
