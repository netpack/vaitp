"string and uncaught error: syntax error, unrecognized expression i have this code, where geturlparamter returns the value of a url parameter and i use that value to select on an input. ..var urlparam   = geturlparameter('a'),.    selectedinput   = $('input[id=""custom-156[' + urlparam + ']""');...this has worked without problem through many rounds of cross-browser testing. however, there have been sporadic error reports from users including, finally, a co-worker. chrome's console showed this error:..uncaught error: syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[id=""custom-156[1]""...my coworker uses the same model computer and the same version of chrome. i don't have this error but he does. why would this be and what is the cause of the error? i think it is a problem with the single double quotes within the pair of single quotes. what is a better way to write this?"
