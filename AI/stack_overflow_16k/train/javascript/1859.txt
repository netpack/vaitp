"for debugging, is there a way to track all types of events in an addeventlistener? i was wondering if there is a way to wildcard the type of event and then console log the event type that is fired in blank's addeventlistener..something like..window.addeventlistener(*, function(evt){.  console.log(evt.target, evt.type, evt.which);.}, false);...i inherited a web project and i'm trying to debug a form event in ios. the classic ""done button event"". the way it was built, they want me to capture the ""done"" click, but it doesn't appear to register as anything. so i will need to rewrite what i was given to make the focus/blur work correctly, which is probably the best approach either way. but i was just curious about wildcarding the addeventlistener..more info...i want it to be cross browser (hoping to test in ios simulator).i don't want to list out all event types, unless i have to."
