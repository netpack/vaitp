"blank reserved words eng i have a div element in my page with id ""eng"". i then use a blank function to restyle it onclick. (specifically, hide) the function used the getelementbyid method. for some reason, it wouldn't work with id ""eng"" but when i changed it to ""english"" (this was the only change i made) it started working. any idea why? i presume it's a reserved keyword, but couldn't find an reference to it...thanks!"
