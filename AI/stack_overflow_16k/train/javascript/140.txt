"why can we access window.document property without specifying window object? as a blank newcomer i see a lot of magic which isn't explained in books. for example, why can i write..document.getelementbyid('one');...when document is a property of window? from what i've read in books, we need to write..window.document.getelementbyid('one');...if document would be regular object like any object we would create by ourselves.....what allows us to omit window parent object while working with document property?..i googled this, but i couldn't find an explanation."
