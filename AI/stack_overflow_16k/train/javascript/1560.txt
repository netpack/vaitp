"blank - how can i find the name of a variable instead of the value it holds i have this function to set the movement of cubes on the canvas (random), everyvar is the variables that will be used and a,b,c,d are functions for +,-,*,/ (sorry if its confusing). is there a way to find the name of the variable instead of the value it holds; i have ""user.s = a(b(c(d(r, 2), e), w), q);"" and i need a way to put that in a repeating function so that the variables stay the same but the information updates, but if i put it somewhere else as it is it will have different variables. i cant just set another variable like myvariable = q because it will save the number not the variable itself (i need it to say user.y instead of 300 for example). please make your answer as simple as possible as i am a beginner as you can probably tell...function setmovement(user){.    var everyvar = [user.x, user.y, user.direction, user.distance]..    var q = everyvar[math.floor(math.random()*everyvar.length)];.    var w = everyvar[math.floor(math.random()*everyvar.length)];.    var e = everyvar[math.floor(math.random()*everyvar.length)];.    var r = everyvar[math.floor(math.random()*everyvar.length)];..    user.s = a(b(c(d(r, 2), e), w), q);..    a = operators[math.floor(math.random()*operators.length)].    b = operators[math.floor(math.random()*operators.length)].    c = operators[math.floor(math.random()*operators.length)].    d = operators[math.floor(math.random()*operators.length)].}"
