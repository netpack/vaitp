not understanding the concept of local and global variables ok so just a quick one... i reaaaaaalllly am not understanding scope at all. do some reason whenever i put a variable inside of a function it's undefined. it seems the only way it works it to declare it outside of a function. so what gives? am i simply misunderstanding the concept of local and global variables? because it seems global variables are the only ones that work.....edit:..simple example.....let a = 'something';.function myfunction() {.    // code block.};...this works ..but the following gives me undefined variables:..function myfunction() {..    let a = 'something';..    // code block.};
