"how to randomize an array with objects i have a simple div that should play random sounds onclick. i store my sounds inside an array of objects like this:..var sounds = [.  {.    animaltype: 'horse',.    sound: new audio('../sounds/horse-neigh.mp3').  },.  {.    animaltype: 'bear',.    sound: new audio('../sounds/grizzlybear.mp3').  },.  {.    animaltype: 'goat',.    sound: new audio('../sounds/goat-noise.mp3'),.  }.]...then when i randomize it it gives me this error: sound.play is not a function..here is my attempt at randomizing it:.. var player = document.getelementbyid('player');.. player.addeventlistener('click', function() . var sound = sounds.sort( () =&gt; math.random() - 0.5). sound.play().})...why is it giving me this error and how can i make it work? it works when it's only an array, but when using an array with objects it doesn't work."
