"blank declaring number in different ways? var a = 1;.var b = number(1);.var c = new number(1);...i was wondering what is the difference between these three statements..i understand that first and second statements are same, as if(a===b) gives true, but the third one will create a object of type number...what i want to know is how these methods are different, and any advantages one will give over the other?"
