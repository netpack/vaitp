"blank detect url the user is leaving to my website, as most websites today, uses the same template for most of its pages and i am building a system that allows for ajax to load only page content without reloading the whole template. for the purpose i'm looking for a method that fires before the browser is redirected to another page. something like onbeforeunload but i also need to know the location of the redirect, is there such a thing?..i need to catch link clicks, back button clicks, forward button clicks as well as manual redirects like window.location = url"
