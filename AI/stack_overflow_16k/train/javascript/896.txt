"i cannot append a child element to a list i used to be able to append a child to a list dynamical but now for some reason the blank functions stop working. also the error console does not throw any errors and i have place several alert('') methods in between the code to make sure that the method is actually running. this is what i used to have and it used to work perfectly fine:..var o = document.getelementbyid('searchresults');..var li = document.createelement('li'); //creates a list item tag..//if counter is even then highlight the cell different than an odd one.if ((counter) % 2 == 0) {.    li.setattribute('class', 'par');.} else {.    li.setattribute('class', 'non');.}..// i copied the inner html from a row that was displaying. i got rid of the dynamic variables.// just so it is a little easier to understand..li.innerhtml = ""&lt;label class='list3p1'&gt;testing&lt;/label&gt;&lt;label class='list3p2'&gt;testing2&lt;/label&gt;&lt;label class='list3p3'&gt;2:23&lt;/label&gt;"";.o.appendchild(li);...this function was working but as i added other tables to index.php this functions stopped working. moreover i have used this similar method in other pages. also other methods are working and that is the only function that does not seem to work."
