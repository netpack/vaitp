"cannot access value of object property i am looping though an object to retrieve some properties but for some reason i cannot access the value of a nested object property...this is my looping function:..  parsecontacts = (contacts) =&gt; {.    return contacts.map(contact =&gt; {.      let parsedcontact = {};.      object.keys(contact).foreach(key =&gt; {.        if (key === 'givenname') {.          parsedcontact.firstname = contact[key];.        } if (key === 'familyname') {.          parsedcontact.surname = contact[key];.        } if (key === 'phonenumbers') {.          parsedcontact.phonenumber = contact[key][0].number;.        }.      }).      return parsedcontact;.    }).  }...firstname and surname work fine, but in the last if statement i get undefined. the property with key phonenumbers it is an array of objects, and this is item 0 in the array:..{id: ""302"", label: ""mobile"", number: ""+44 7x7x 50xx72""}...when i use this code instead:..} if (key === 'phonenumbers') {.          parsedcontact.phonenumber = contact[key][0];.        }...without .number on the end i get the whole object back fine, i just can't get back only the number property from the object...update..on closer inspection, the array which has over 800 large objects in, some of the lengths of the phonenumbers arrays were 0 so the property did not exist. this was causing the whole function to fail. thanks for the comments below...my solution was to add to the if statement:..if (key === 'phonenumbers' &amp;&amp; contact[key].length)"
