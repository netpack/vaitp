"objects do not appear on the screen when i put them in a loop yesterday i started using blank p5 library. my problem is that when i write objects manually in draw() function - they appear on the screen and everything is fine, but when i put them in a loop, they do not appear...function draw() {.   object[0].show();.   object[1].show();.   object[2].show();.   object[3].show();.}...this works fine...for(var i = 0; i &lt; objectscreated; i++) {.    object[i].show();.}...this does not work...this.show = function() {.    fill(this.color);.    rect(this.x, this.y, this.sizex, this.sizey);.}...this is my function for showing it."
