"blank - fading from one item to another pops up with both briefly i have a testimonials area on my website that fades from one testimonial to another. i'm having an issue where it will fade out too slowly before the next item fades in causing both to come up making a large div making it look ugly...i want it to fade from one testimonial to another without jumping and flashing with both...you can see an example here: http://ledragonvert.com/index_test.php..here is my blank code:..function rotate_p() {.if (p_current == p_count) {.p_current = 1;.} else {.p_current++;.}.var $container = $('#container');.$container.find('p').fadeout();.$container.find('p:nth-child(' + p_current + ')').fadein();.}..var p_count;.var p_current = 0;.var p_interval;.$(document).ready(function () {.rotate_p();.p_count = $('#container').find('p').length;.p_interval = setinterval(function () {rotate_p();}, 7000);.});...thanks you very much for taking your time out to help me."
