"creating indexof function i am trying to create the indexof function but it is not working. i am a noob programmer and started learning blank a few days ago. ..i tried using loops but i don't think the concept of loops was clear with me. can anyone please check the below code and help me understand what i did wrong and the correct usage of loops?   ....function index(arr, srchvlu) {.  for (srchvlu = 0; srchvlu &lt; arr.length; srchvlu = srchvlu + 1) {.    result = srchvlu;.  }.  return result;.}..var ans = (index(""hello"", ""l""));..console.log(ans);.....i expect the output to be 2 but the actual output is 4."
