"i can't figure this out, my script has an issue my issue..   window.onkeydown = function(e) {.     var code = e.keycode ? e.keycode : e.which;.     if (code === 71) {.       alert(""hi"");.     }.   };....   window.onkeyup = function(e) {.     var code = e.keycode ? e.keycode : e.which;.     if (code === 69) {.       alert(""hi"");.     }.   };...dont mind the following text!! i thought this would be answered somewhere on so, but i can't find it...if i'm listening for a keypress event, should i be using .keycode or .which to determine if the enter key was pressed?..i've always done something like the following:dont mind this text!!"
