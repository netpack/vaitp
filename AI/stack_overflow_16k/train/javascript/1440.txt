"blank: expected identifier i am creating an html document and using blank to create an image element..here is my code (create is already defined):..create=document.createelement(""img"");.create.src = 'data/1.png';.create.alt = 'image1';.create.style.magin = '1px';.eval(""create.id = 'image"" + count + ""'"");.create.class = 'block'; // line that breaks the code.document.body.appendchild(create);...i don't know what's going wrong here, but it's probably something obvious. does anyone have any ideas?"
