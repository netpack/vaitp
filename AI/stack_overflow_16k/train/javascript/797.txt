"if i get a site using client-side blank, what will the site see as the requesting ip? my server or the client's? i'm building an app where the user may occasionally make a search.  i'd like to run the search through google, but i'm unsure in the event i have many users if i will hit  google's search quota.  any individual user will not make more than one or two searches a day on the app.  but cumulatively, it could potentially be much more...will doing client side retrival of a google query avoid this problem and not identify my server as the origin ip?"
