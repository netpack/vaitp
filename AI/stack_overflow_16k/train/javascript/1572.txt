"why all objects properties are printed when we assign only one to a variable and print it i am new blank while practicing i came across a point as ..i have object with some properties and their values,though i have assigned only one property to var x as below, why and how come it prints all  property values instead of only one as ""new york city"" in output.. var city= {.    fullname: ""new york city"",.    mayor: ""bill de blasio"",.    population: 8000000,.    boroughs: 5.};..    // write a for-in loop to print the value of city's properties.    var x= ""fullname"";.    for(var x in city){.    console.log(city[x]);.    }...actual output is :.new york city.bill de blasio.8000000.5..rather than ""new york city"" only"
