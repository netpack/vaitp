"can i get an arithmetic expression as a string computed with the blank math object? if i have an arithmetic expression as a string (""2+3*4/5""), is there a way to get this computed with the blank math object without parsing that entire string to separate everything out?..edit: for now, i'm just concerned about supporting +-*/ with order of operations. i'm open to eval if we can piece together a regular expression to address security."
