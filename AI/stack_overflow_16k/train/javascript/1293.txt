"how reliable is this way of sorting arrays of objects by multiple properties? i need to sort an array of object literals and i need to compare 2 of the object's properties. i found an example online of how to do it but i couldn't find any supporting documentation in the spec. can anyone confirm that you can do the following in blank and possibly point me to some documentation:..users.sort(function(a, b){ .    return [a.name, a.company] &gt; [b.name, b.company] ? 1:-1; .});...edit: i now get why this is working, it's because it's simply concatenating and then comparing the strings. i don't think the intention is very clear so i'll probably write something a little less hacky...also, i wasn't simply asking if you could create a custom sort function, that you can easily find in the docs. i was asking if the way i was doing it in this particular case is valid."
