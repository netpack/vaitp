"what is the best way to convert from csv to json when commas and quotations may be in the fields? i want to be able to convert a csv to json. the csv comes in as free text like this (with the newlines):..name,age,booktitle.john,2,hello world.mary,3,""""alas, what can i do?"""".joseph,5,""waiting, waiting, waiting""...my problem as you can tell is the file......has got some interior commas in some fields, though they are wrapped in at least one double quote..there could be double quotes within the file....i would like the output to not have any leading and trailing quotes for each field... how can i correctly create a json object parsed out from the csv string that represents this csv accurately? (without the leading and trailing quotes). ..i usually use:..var mycsvstring;.var finalconvertedjson = {};.var headerfields = // get headers here.var lines = mycsvstring.split('n');...for(var i = 0; i &lt; lines.length; i++) {.// loop through each line and set a key for each header field that corresponds to the appropriate lines[i]    .}"
