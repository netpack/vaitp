"google places api why does it returns lat and lon under a different variable each time? this is driving me nuts, for some reason the api used to return the lat and lon like this:.(i think it was like this):..place.geometry.location.y as latitude.   place.geometry.location.z as longitude..then it started returning it like this:..place.geometry.location.ya as latitude.   place.geometry.location.za as longitude..and today my app wasn't working and i discovered that it was because the google api was returning the lat and lon like this:..place.geometry.location.$a as latitude.   place.geometry.location.ab as longitude..wtf? how am i supposed to work with this? i'm thinking on simply reading the first variable inside locations as latitude and the second as longitude regardless their names. but i'm afraid the api might return a completely different object next time and mess up my blank...anyone experienced this? what am i supposed to do?"
