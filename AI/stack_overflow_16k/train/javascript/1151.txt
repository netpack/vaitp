"blank: travel to another page to get specific info that's not on the current page? lets say i have blank that runs on page a.  ..page b contains some specific piece of info that i would like to display,  as an example:..&lt;script tye=""text/blank""&gt;.  var specificpieceofinfo = ""the secret number is 10"".&lt;/script&gt;...page a knows the url to page b (let's just say its www.pageb.com)..is there a way for page a to get access to specificpieceofinfo from page b? i know in python i could use something like the requests library, but i'm not sure what i can do with blank."
