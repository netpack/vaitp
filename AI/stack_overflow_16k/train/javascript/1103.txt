"blank ""then""ing of a member function doesn't trigger '15 i'm trying to wrap my head around blank's then structure (supposably an easy way to implement promises if i understand correctly). almost all answers i find are from years ago, and things seem to have updated significantly since then. honestly, i am also having difficulty understanding documentation on promises and then, so i could easily be making a basic mistake. ..i've got some test code as such:..function foo(){.   this.start = function(){.       return {.           then: function(callback){.               alert(""waiting for this to finish."");.           }.      }.   }.}.var makeitso = new foo();.makeitso.start().then( function() {.    alert(""i waited!"");.});...although the ""waiting for this to finish"" fires, the ""i waited!"" never does. what do i need to change in my foo function so that this works?"
