"how can i replace words in a sentence while still keeping punctuation in blank? i want to search through a message's contents and replace certain words with ones that match the ones that have translations. ..example input:.'i took a selfie with my bae next to a tardis. yolo!'..filtered output:.'i took a self-portrait with my loved one next to a tardis. carpe diem!'..my code is translating the words, but only the words that do not have extra punctuation attached to the words like '.' and '!'. i.e. it translates to: 'i took a self-portrait with my bae. yolo!'..i am starting with an object of the words and their translations:..let blacklist = {.  'selfie': 'self-portrait',.  'yummers': 'delicious',.  'outchea': 'are out here',.  'bruh': 'wow',.  'doge': 'pug',.  'cilantro': 'soap',.  'bae': 'loved one',.  'swag': 'style',.  'yolo': 'carpe diem'.};...here is my code to translate the words:..const message = 'i took a selfie with my bae next to a tardis. yolo!'..translate(message) =&gt; {.  let wordarray = message.split(' ');.  for(let i = 0; i &lt; wordarray.length; i++) {.    if(blacklist.hasownproperty(wordarray[i])){.      wordarray[i] = blacklist[wordarray[i]];.    }.  }.  console.log(wordarray.join(' '));.};"
