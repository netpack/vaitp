"how do i split an array by the characters in an array in blank? i have an array of characters:..var separators = ['a', 'b', 'c'];...i want to split a string by any of the characters in this array. for instance,..var str = 'adbasscdabda';...should become..var splituparray = ['d', 'ss', 'd', 'd'];...how do i achieve this? i have tried splitting the string by one character at a time and then concatenating the subarrays together, but this seems unwieldy."
