"is there a standalone blank compiler / interpreter with a console that i can use to practice blank outside of the browser? i would like to practice blank and am looking for a stand-alone compiler or interpreter that i can run on my desktop as an exe so i do not have to create html pages and run them in a browser just to test the blank code. that would be a lot of boilerplate. i am looking for something that does for blank what linqpad does for linq...i am pretty sure i saw something online but can't remember its name. you would type things and run them and test them out online...i am aware that most browsers today provide some kind of a blank editor or sandbox or console where you can do the same thing. i was just curious if i could do something similar as a stand-alone process...and if there isn't, even if i can be reminded of that online thing where you tried your code snippets, that would be great. i think it was called gist or something else that usually i used to know like the back of my hand but it desperately escapes me now."
