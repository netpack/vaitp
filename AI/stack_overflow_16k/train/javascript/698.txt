"run a loop n times i'm writing a program that will calculate a number entered by the user multiplied by 2...i realised i need a for loop so that the value will increment by 1 and multiple by 2..the problem is i want to know how to run this loop only 10 times.- at the current moment it will run for ever and i had to place an if statement to break out of the loop if the value reaches 50.....//prompt user to enter number.let value = prompt(""enter a number"");.//user entered number will loop through while output will show multiples //of 2.for (value;; value++) {.  value2 = value * 2;.  document.write(`${value} multiply 2 -&gt; ${value2}`);.  document.write('&lt;br&gt;');.  //i placed this if statement to break out of the for loop as it //will run forever.  if (value &gt; 50) {.    break;.  }.}"
