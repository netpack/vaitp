"run function again after x amount seconds i would like to re run a the same function after x amount of seconds..the x changes every time the function is ran like the example i have provided below but the code below does not wait half a second before fireing the function again, it just instantly runs the function in an infinite loop ..test();.var interval = 500.function test() {.    interval = interval + 500;.    console.log(""1"");.    settimeout(test(), interval);.}"
