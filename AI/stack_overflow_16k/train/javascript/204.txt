"more than one arguments passing for event listener if we have a function foo, and bar is a random variable, what would be the difference between invoking it as this.foo and foo(bar)?..how could we invoke the function after an event with two parameters?..for example:..var div1 = document.getelementbyid(""id1"");.div1.addeventlistener('onevent', this.foo);...i tried to do the following:..var bar = ""382"";.div1.addeventlistener('onevent', function(event) { baz(event, bar) } );...but it was not successful. any ideas?.thanks!"
