"solve max height of up to 20 objects i have 1 to 20 objects inside a canvas..the objects have left, width, top and height attributes...i divided my canvas into 12 sections. each objects width can be 1/12th of the canvas width (month) or 3/12th (quarter)...now i need to get the sum of the heights of all objects inside each of the 12 grid sections...for example..in section 1 is 1 month-object with the height 12 --> result 12.in section 2 are 2 month-objects. heights 10 and 14 --> result 24.in section 4 are 1 month-object and one quarter object: heights 12 and 14 -->result 26.in section 5 are 1 month-object and the same quarter object: heights 4 and 14 --> result 18  ..hope this was understandable. solution is needed in blank..what i have is an array with all the beginning sections and all the ending sections.  ..for example:..startingsections = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5].endingsections = [1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 5]...my desired output is the following:..var sectionsmax = [];.sectiosnmax = getmonthlytops();..function getmonthlytops(){.  var monthlytops = [];..  /* code here */..  return monthlytops;.}...results could be:..sectionsmax = [12, 24, 0, 26, 18, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]...example picture:"
