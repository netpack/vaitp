"snapshot of a variable blank i'm trying to keep a record array of a certain variable, but whenever i push that variable it doesn't push an instance of that variable, but the variable itself...var array = [0,0,0];.var record = [];..record.push(array);.for(var i=0;i&lt;array.length;i++) {.    array[i]++;.}.record.push(array);.console.log(record);.//i need record to be [[0,0,0],[1,1,1]], but it gives two copies of the latter"
