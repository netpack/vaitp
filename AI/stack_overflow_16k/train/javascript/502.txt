"how to create new object based on object properties i'm trying to figure out a way to create a new object that summarizes a collection of statistics...the info for this new object comes from an array of the following form....now, i would need to store this data in a new object, something like:..{.   blocks: [41, 22, 3, 4],.   delivered: [23, 11, 2, 1].}...and access it like object.blocks[0], object.delivered[0], object.blocks1, object.delivered1... etc..where 'blocks', 'delivered' should be created automatically...is this even possible?"
