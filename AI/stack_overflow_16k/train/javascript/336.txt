"efficiency of calling array.length in blank most looping examples i see in blank use the array.length property in the for loop itself, like so:..var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];.for (var i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {.  // do something.}...however, sometimes i see the array.length property being written to a variable, and then the variable value is used in the loop, instead:..var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];.var len = numbers.length;.for (var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {.  // do something.}...coming from a c# background, i've never had to worry about this. however, in blank is the second method more efficient and why?"
