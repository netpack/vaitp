"create date object that is same for everyone from same timestamp on my site i am getting the current time via ajax function that returns the servers current timestamp and then creating a date object...$.post(flipcountdownobj.ajax_url, data, function(response) {..        var currenttime = new date(parseint(response) * 1000);.        alert(""server says the time is "" + currenttime.tolocaletimestring());..        // code to create my countdown here.....}...my logic then goes on to compare that date to various other dates to provide countdowns and event status...my problem is though that everyone is getting different times...i am in gmt.  the server is in est.  for me it says the correct time but people in est are saying that it is 4 hours out...i don't understand why this is happening as the timestamp should be the same for everyone...i saw a post saying about setting utc time but not sure exactly what i am meant to do.  can anyone shed some light on what i am doing wrong?"
