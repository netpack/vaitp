"how to redefine js function keeping previous in chain this is common task coming from object oriented programming, i would like to change behavior of blank program by overriding existing function with possible calling it as well. i remember windows introduced that as writing hooks and chaining them. so what i want, i have a web page which calls some onload hook which finally calls function initfields. i want to redefine this function however keep previous implementation. if i simply define my js function as ..function initfields() {.  // do some stuff ....   // i do not know how to call super.initfields() here.}...i read something like you can write..initfields.prototype = function() {.     // do some stuff ....     // but still have no idea how to call the original one. };...can somebody help?"
