"adding onclick event to dynamically created links by id and scrollintoview after page has loaded looking to use scrollintoview for id's of links that are created dynamically. after the link is clicked the same page is loaded but user information is filled in. i am able to scroll to where i want but then the page loads and it starts back at the top. i want this scrollintoview to happen after the page is loaded and not before. i have tried creating a global variable and window.onload function that scrolls to that variable. the variable is then changed to the respective link id when it is clicked. that did not seem to work...const buttons = document.queryselectorall('[id^=pc10269_ev2wiz_step2_ctlregs_rptperevent_rptreggroups]').for (const button of buttons){.   button.addeventlistener('click', function(){.     button.scrollintoview();.   }.)}...this did not work : ..let mybtn = window.top;.window.onload = function() {.    mybtn.scrollintoview();.};..const buttons = document.queryselectorall('[id^=pc10269_ev2wiz_step2_ctlregs_rptperevent_rptreggroups]').for (const button of buttons){.   button.addeventlistener('click', function(){.     mybtn = button;.   }.)}"
