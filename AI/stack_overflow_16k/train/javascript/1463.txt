"in blank how can i detect if a browser will display or download a pdf? say i have...a webpage with an iframe: .an url pointing to a pdf document: http://www.example.com.some blank that will do iframe.src=pdfurl.a button that will trigger such blank...if the browser is going to display the pdf inline, the button will.say ""view pdf"" and when clicked will make the iframe visible.otherwise it will say ""download pdf""....i found a way to detect wether the pdf has been loaded in the iframe: reading iframe.contentdocument.contenttype after onload has fired, but ...this won't allow me to display the correct button.onload does not fire if the file is being downloaded...thanks :)"
