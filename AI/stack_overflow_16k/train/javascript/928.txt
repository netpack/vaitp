"how to know if window.opener comes from my webpage? i have a login popup that modifies its parent page with window.opener.location.href = xxx. the code goes something like this...  if (window.opener) {.      window.opener.location.href = window.location.href;.      self.close();.  } ...the problem with this, is that if someone has a link to my webpage, like lets say, a link from an email, this code will be executed and the parent is the email client. this will throw a blank error cause i'm trying to alter a webpage that is not mine.(in chrome, it says ""unsafe blank attempt to access frame with url"")..i want to know if there is a way i can find out if the window.opener comes from my webpage."
