"js form: mixed textarea and input types causes wrong focus on click i have a working an in-house form that generates some html code when users enter field data...problem is i have a single 'textarea' object mixed in with 20 or so other 'input type' objects, and focus is always sent to the text area when any form object below it is clicked...i have tried with and without tabindex values. but, really the tab order is not the issue (tab order works fine). the problem is when a user manually clicks any field on the form, the cursor is taken to the 'textarea' field...so, to replicate the issue, load the form below. try to click on any form element below the text area. when an element is clicked focus is put on the textarea field...here's the full form:..http://devtest.host.org/testing/test-form.html..thanks."
