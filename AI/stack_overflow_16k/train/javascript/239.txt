write a program that will form a matrix it should look like this:..0 1 2 3 4.1 0 1 2 3.2 1 0 1 2.3 2 1 0 1.4 3 2 1 0...i am using for loop with another nested loop but with no success. here are my lame attempts to figure it out. ......for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {.       for (var j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {.              document.write(j);.        }.document.write(“&lt;br&gt;” + (i + 1));.}
