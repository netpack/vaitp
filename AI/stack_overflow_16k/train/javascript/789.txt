"why foreach array method is not a function on looping over document.getelementsbyclassname in order to get the matched elements &amp; loop over it , i am using  queryselectorall &amp; foreach array method. according to this,queryselectorall will return a nodelist...i can also use getelementsbyclassname by get the matched elements but cannot directly use foreach. but this link tell us that it also return an nodelist object..on using foreach on return of getelementsbyclassname it throws an error ,foreach is not a function..can you please let me know why foreach does not directly work on return of getelementsbyclassname, when return of both getelementsbyclassname &amp; queryselectorall is nodelist"
