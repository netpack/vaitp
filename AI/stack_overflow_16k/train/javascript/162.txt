"a question about a little gusess the age game i made with js in my udemy course, we just got introduced to js! .i love this language, and right now i'm pretty much a novice. .i hope you can help me, i want my code to keep asking the user to guess the age that i've set as the sercretnumber...i got 2 problems :..1) i think my code can and need to be shorter maybe with some or and and...2) i can't get it to tell the user that if the number is negative or above 100, to prompt the user again for input by saying - your number needs to be from 1-100.. i get it to work once and it's gone!..here's the js code :..var secretnumber=98;.var numbgues=number(prompt(""can you guses my age? (hint - its 1-100"")).....    while (numbgues!=secretnumber){..    // here i want this message to keep repeating if the user enters a non-valid input such as: -987 , or 54564654//..      if (numbgues&lt;0 || numbgues&gt;100 ){.        var numbgues=number(prompt(""pleae choose a valid number between 1-100"")).      }....      if (numbgues&lt;secretnumber){.        var numbgues=number(prompt(""too low! try again"")).      }....     else  if (numbgues&gt;secretnumber) {.        var numbgues=number(prompt(""too high! try again!"")).      }..      if (numbgues==secretnumber) {.        alert(""you guessed it!"").      }..    }"
