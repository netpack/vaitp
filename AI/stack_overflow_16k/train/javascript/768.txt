"doing math in multiple blank functions i'm new to the blank world and trying to figure out this assignment my teacher assigned. here is his description of what is expected:...build a function that will start the program. please call it start().from the start() function, call a function called getvalue().the getvalue() function will get a number from the user that will be squared..also from the start function, call a function called makesquare().the makesquare() function will square the number that was received by the user in the getvalue() function..make sure that you display the results of squaring the number inside of the makesquare() function....here is what i have so far:..function start() {..    getvalue();.    getsquare();.}..function getvalue() {..    var a = prompt(""number please"").}..function getsquare() {..    var b = math.pow(a).    document.write(b).}..start()...this assignment doesn't have to be working with any html tags. i've only got the prompt box to work, nothing else does though. am i using variables in a way that can't be used?"
