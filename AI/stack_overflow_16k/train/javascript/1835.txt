"blank: how to pass object by value? .when passing objects as parameters, blank passes them by reference and makes it hard to create local copies of the objects...var o = {};.(function(x){.    var obj = x;.    obj.foo = 'foo';.    obj.bar = 'bar';.})(o)...o will have .foo and .bar..it's possible to get around this by cloning; simple example:..var o = {};..function clone(x) {.   for(p in x).   this[p] = (typeof(x[p]) == 'object')? new clone(x[p]) : x[p];.}..(function(x){.    var obj = new clone(x);.    obj.foo = 'foo';.    obj.bar = 'bar';.})(o)...o will not have .foo or .bar......question...is there a better way to pass objects by value, other than creating a local copy/clone?"
