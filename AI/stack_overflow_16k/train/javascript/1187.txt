"show/hide green tick upon input field change i wont put the whole code, since i think it doesnt matter, because the problem is js related. i have a form and input fields(2 password fields). with css i made a ""green tick"" next to these fields. i want these green ticks to appear when both fields are equal, and re-appear when i delete one ""character"" from one of the fields - when they are not equal. ..pswd1/pswd2 - my input pass fields..i want the green ticks to show when they are equal and when the length of the second field(the confirmation one) is greater than 6..$('#pswd1').on('change', function(){.   pass = $('#pswd1').val();.   pass1 = $(""#pswd2"").val();.   if(pass = pass1 &amp;&amp; pass1.length &gt; 6){.       $(""#gtick1"").show();``.       $(""#gtick2"").show();.     }.});"
