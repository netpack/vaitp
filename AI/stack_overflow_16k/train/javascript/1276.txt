"namespace constants i'm looking for an ideal way to namespace some constants to access later in my code. ideally the constants will be two layers deep where the first layer is the namespace for the entire project. let's call that foo. the second layer is the class which the constants are representing, let's call it bar. is the best way to implement something like this using the following?..var foo = foo || {};.foo.bar = {.  const_a: 1,.  const_b: 220130324,.  ....}...is the best way to retrieve the value of const_a the following:..foo.bar.const_a? is there a way to write a helper method so i don't have to use the fully qualified namespace in order to access the constant? what's the best way to do this in blank?"
