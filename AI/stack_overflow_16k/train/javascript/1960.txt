"total height of the page i'm trying to get the total height of a page using blank so i can check if the page is long enough to display something, however in my testing i am unable to get the total height of a page...i've looked around on the internet but things like this don't seem to be well documented, as all i can find is scrollheight, which, as i might mention, doesn't work. ..any way to use blank to find it?"
