"blank calculating mileage rates i'm creating a hr mileage and expenses system but am struggling to come up with a way of calculating the rates correctly...there are 2 rates for car, motorbike, and bicycle. one rate for upto 10,000 miles one rate for over 10,000 miles..lets just take car rates as an example. currently it's 45pence per mile up to 10,000 miles and 25pence per mile there after...so i have the variables to hold the business mileage and keep it adding but how can i handle the change over of rates?.for example: businessmiles = 9990, mileage claimed = 100..so i need to check the business miles are less than 10,000 then the difference between the business miles and the limit. which is 10 miles @ 0.45 and 90 miles @ 0.25...with chris's pointers here's my output:..//calculate mileage.var businessmilesclaimed = ""100"";.var currentmilesclaimed = ""12110"";..if (currentmilesclaimed &lt; 10000).    {.        var claimedamount = +businessmilesclaimed + +currentmilesclaimed;..        if (claimedamount &gt; 10000).            {.                var claimcalc1 = (claimedamount - 10000) * 0.25;.                var claimcalc2 = (10000 - currentmilesclaimed) * 0.45;.                var claimresult = +claimcalc1 + +claimcalc2;.            }.        else.            {.            var claimresult = businessmilesclaimed * 0.45;.            }.    }.else.    {.        var claimresult = businessmilesclaimed * 0.25;.    }"
