"body not set with correct content height i'm using object oriÃ«nted blank and handlebars as templating system. .today i discovered a problem which i can't solve. when you use templates, they are loaded after the full dom structure, a result is that the window and body don't get the right height. concluding that my content is cut off at the bottom of the window and i don't get a scrollbar..all elements (divs, forms, ...) are added via blank. anyone knows how to solve this issue?"
