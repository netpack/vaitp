"would you ever implement a linked list in blank? i'm learning about data structures formally for the first time. to me, some of the benefits traditionally described of linked lists (easier memory allocation and faster input and deletion to the body of the list) seem moot in js given the way arrays work (like objects with numbered keys)...can anyone give an example of why i'd want to use a linked list in blank?"
