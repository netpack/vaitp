"how to use blank regexp to resolve relative paths? i want to implement a utility method, which can be used to resolve relative paths..the method should be implemented using blank regexp, and the algorithm is required as follows:..1) all occurrences of ""segment/../"", where segment is a.              complete path segment not equal to "".."", are removed..              removal of these path segments is performed iteratively,.              removing the leftmost matching pattern on each iteration,.              until no matching pattern remains...2) if the path ends with ""/.."", where  is a.              complete path segment not equal to "".."", that.              ""/.."" is removed...examples:..a/b/css/../../d  ==&gt; a/d.a/b/c.ss/../../d ==&gt; a/d.a/b/css/../..    ==&gt; a/.a/bss/../../../  ==&gt; ../.../../../        ==&gt; ../../../...i have tried to implement this method:..var result = ""a/b/c.ss/../../d"";..while(result.indexof('..') &gt;= 0).{.   var temp = result.replace(/([^./]*)/../?/,'');.   if (temp == result){.       break;.   }.   result = temp;.}...but it can't deal with ""a/b/c.ss/../../d"", so how can i correct it?..please help me out!"
