"why does only one of these lines of blank fire upon page load? i am trying to really understand the details of how a browser loads a webpage. ...load and execution sequence of a web page?.window.onload vs $(document).ready()...i have two blank statements in a .js file attached to an html file:..d3.select(""body"").append(""span"").text(""hello, world!"");.alert(""huh?""); ...when i load the page, i see an alert ""huh."" so the ""huh"" statement fires. ..however ""hello, world"" is not appended to the document body. ..if i then go and run d3.select(""body"").append(""span"").text(""hello, world!"") in the console then it executes as expected--i.e. it adds ""hello, world"" to the body...what's going on here?  alert(""huh?"")fires after the window.onload event in the dom, correct? but d3.select... does not fire?..why the discrepancy?"
