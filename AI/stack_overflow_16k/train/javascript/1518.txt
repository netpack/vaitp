keep the all the elements at the same place i'm wondering because i am coding through multiple screen sizes and making a game that requires event.pagex and smaller screen sizes mean squishing everything as well as bigger screen sizes that push everything outwards. is there a way to keep everything all positioned into one place so if you change screen sizes it is still positioned the same?
