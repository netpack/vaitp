"how do i use inversed tan in blank? i need to calculate an angle of a triangle by using the tan^-1 function. on my calculator i can do this: ..tan^-1(3/4) // 3 and 4 are triangle side lengths ..and it outputs 36 degrees. what is the alternative to this function in blank? i tried math.tan(3/4), math.atan(3/4) and all of the other tan functions i saw in the list, but none of them outputs the result in degrees i need (36)..thank you."
