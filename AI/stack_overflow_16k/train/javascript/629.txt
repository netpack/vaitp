"how to make ""case 3"" into some sort of ""case random"" i'm completing something for an assignment in my coding course, but i am stuck on a part of trying to set a number to random. also, there are 3 blocks that have this, except the last block does not have an event.stoppropagation();...i have tried setting ""case 3"" (which needs to be edited to something else) to ""case random"" but that did not work. it would only make it so that anything you would type in the prompt() would display the ""you got it!"" message.......alert( ""guess the number i'm thinking. it's between 1 and 5. you have 3 tries."" )   ..var min = 1;.var max = 5;.var random = math.floor(math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;.prompt( ""you have 3 tries remaning."" );.switch ( random ).{.    case 3:     alert( ""you got it!"");.    event.stoppropagation();..    break;..    default:    alert( ""that is incorrect. try again."" );..    break;.}.......i expect it to set a random (whole) number and have the user able to guess it, and have it validate properly..also, if there is anything else wrong with this block of code, could you please help me?"
