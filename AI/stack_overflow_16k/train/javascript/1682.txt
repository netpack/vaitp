"how to create an array as such using blank using blank, i want to create an array that has the structure so that it can have all states within the country array. each state would be an array consisting all the regions within it. and each region would contain all the health clubs within it. something like this:..[australia]=&gt;array([nsw]=&gt;array([sydney]=&gt;array(element1, element2, ...)));...so far i have tried many things including the code below:..$('#search-widget-data li').each(function(){.var dataelement = $(this);.searchwidgetdata.push(dataelement.text());.alldata.push([dataelement.prevall("".state:first"").text(),             .dataelement.prevall("".region:first"").text());.});"
