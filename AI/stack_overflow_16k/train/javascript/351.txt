"is there ever a reason to not use ""var"" when initially declaring a blank variable? i already know the difference between using ""var"" and not using ""var"" to declare a blank variable.  using ""var"" ensures that the variable exists as a distinct entity strictly within the local scope of the code block, whereas not using ""var"" would effectively make the variable global.  i also know that if you declare a variable at the global level, it doesn't matter whether you use ""var"" or not...so my question is, is there ever a situation where it would be better to not declare a variable using ""var""?  ..so far, i'm under the impression that it never hurts to always use ""var"" to declare a variable.  are there exceptions to this?"
