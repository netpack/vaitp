"how to use a function multiple times to dump text to the console.log i have literally just started started looking at js in the past couple of days. i have been reading up on variables and functions and the problem i am trying to solve is creating a very simple getweather app...the goal of the app is the following:...  create a function called getweather that will have 2 parameters. one >called country and one called weathertype. call the getweather >function with 2 arguments. the first should be “scotland”, the second >should be “sunny”. your function should return the string “the weather >in scotland is sunny”. wrap the call to getweather in a console.log() >to print out the string. call the getweather function two more times >with countries and weathertypes of your choice....this is the code that i have come up with so far:..// function to store both parameteres..const getweather = (country, weathertype);..var country = 'scotland';.var weathertype = 'sunny';..// dumps the weather results to the console..{console.log(`the weather in ${country} is ${weathertype}.`)};...so far i have it dumping ""the weather in scotland is sunny.""..but i need to be able to dump multiple statements to the console, for example:..the weather in scotland is sunny..the weather in england is raining..the weather in wales is overcast..the weather in ireland is thunder...i have tried using code like:..let getweather = ('scotland, sunny').let getweather = ('england, raining')...but this throws an error, can anyone point in the right direction?"
