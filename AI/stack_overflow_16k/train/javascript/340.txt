"why doesn't this code loop through all properties of an object? here is a little code snippet:..cards = [ 4, 10, 3, 12, 10, 13, 12  ];.suits = [ 1, 64, 8, 8, 1, 1, 32 ];..var o = {}, keycount = 0, j;..for (i = 0; i &lt; cards.length; i++) {.    e = cards[i] + suits[i];.    o[e] = 1.}..for (j in o) {.    if (o.hasownproperty(j)) {.        keycount++;.    }.}...after some debugging i found out that when i iterate through all the properties in the 'o' object (the second loop) the loop only executes 6 times instead of 7...this is despite adding 7 properties to the 'o' object in the first loop. ..why is this? i have added 7 properties in the first loop so why does the second loop only execute 6 times?"
