"blank object.create() method if you look in the docs it says that object.create():...  the object.create() method creates a new object with the specified.  prototype object and properties....i think this is ambiguous, because it doesn't say which prototype property is modified (internal [[prototype]] or publicly available prototype all functions have). should it be fixed in the docs or maybe i'm not aware of the terminology?"
