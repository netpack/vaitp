"adding results to objects i have a small function which adds a returned result to a list of objects but the problem i have is if there is a certain duplicate it will not allow it - but there are some aspects where duplication occurs and other aspects which do not.....i'll explain better with example:..var data = {""24"":{""16"":[""172""],""15"":[""160""]}}...this list of data translates to :..var data = {""x"":{""y"":[""id""],""y"":[""id""]}};...now im trying to insert new data like this:..    for(var key in result){              .      if(result.hasownproperty(key)){  .      data[key] = result[key];     .        }.    }...if you consider grid co-ordinates,  in my list of objects, y cannot be duplicated in the same x and x can not be duplicated at all...this is example data of ""result"" that im trying to insert:..{24: {13:[187]}}...thus turning var data to :..var data = {""24"":{""16"":[""172""],""15"":[""160""],""13"":[""187""]}};...does any one know how i can implement a duplication check for my loop ?"
