"read an string array as property name? newdesign = {.    color: 'blue',.    shape: 'round'.}..olddesign = {.    color: 'yellow',.    shape: 'triangle'.}...i want to compare this two design to see if their field is changed, so i write these:..fields = [ 'color', 'shape' ].for (let field in fields) {.    if (olddesign.field !== newdesign.field).        console.log('changed').}...however, looks like i can't read the value of fields by using olddesign.field...is there a way to to this? thank you."
