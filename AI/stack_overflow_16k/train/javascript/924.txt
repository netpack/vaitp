"adding attributes to array key value pairs i am trying to add attributes to existing key-value pairs of an array in blank. specifically adding ""id"" to key, and ""quantity"" to values...i have tried to use object.keys(array) and object.values(array) to separate and tried to rebuild a new array with object.entries(array). have no idea how to add the required attributes into the array. any assistance is greatly appreciated...the array is as follows:..{.    1: ""1"",.    2: ""1"",.    3: ""1"".}...this is the actual result i am looking to achieve:..[.    {.        id: ""1"",.        quantity: ""1"".    },.    {.        id: ""2"",.        quantity: ""1"".    },.    {.        id: ""3"",.        quantity: ""1"".    }.]"
