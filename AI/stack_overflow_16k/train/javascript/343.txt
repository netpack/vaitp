(in safari/chrome), a claimed clever solution is made on how to figure out the actual size of an image. ..var t = new image();.t.src = (img_element.getattribute ? img_element.getattribute(""src"") : false) || img_element.src;...i'm trying to figure out what the second row does. i know the source that i want to use and thus simply declared it. this did not result in any other attributes, such as t.width."
