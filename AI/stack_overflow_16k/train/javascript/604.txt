"pass relative files into function using blank file constructor i'm trying to load in a relative file address into a function previously used by a file reader. on the site, i had a button that would let you pick local files to be loaded into a graphics renderer. i want to use a url to access these files relatively instead, but i can't figure out how to bind them to a file object. i have been using this mozilla documentation to try and figure it out...here is the code that was used originally:..// function that takes file input and renders the image.function readfiles(){.  // deal with file input.  if (window.file &amp;&amp; window.filereader &amp;&amp; window.filelist &amp;&amp; window.blob) {.    var file1 = document.getelementbyid('fileinput').files[0];.    var file2 = document.getelementbyid('fileinput').files[1];..    // call the file analyzer.    fileanalyzer( file1, file2 );..  } else {.    alert('the file apis are not fully supported by your browser.');.  }.}...here is the code that i want to update:..// load cube button.  var loadcube = document.getelementbyid('loadcube');.  loadcube.onclick = function(evt) {.    var file1 = new file([], ""object files/cube3.coor"" );.    var file2 = new file([], ""object files/cube3.poly"" );.    fileanalyzer( file1, file2);.  }"
