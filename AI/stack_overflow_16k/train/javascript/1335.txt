"why return undefined in simple condition even variabes already assigned in browser console i know undefined is a property of the global object....  a variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined....but i wonder why i get undefined of assigned values in a if else condition..here is my code..var a;.var b;..a =5.b =10;..if((b&gt;a)).  console.log(""a is greater than b"").else  .  console.log(""b is greater than a"") ...and i get..undefined.b is greater than a ...why it return undefined first even both variable is already assigned"
