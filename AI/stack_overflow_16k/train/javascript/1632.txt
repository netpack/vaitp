"replace a value at the end of a string converted to an array in one line? is there a way to replace the last item in array with one line of code? ..what i receive:..return ""my.long.string"";...what i want: ..return ""my.long.output"";...code so far:  ..var value = ""my.long.string"";.var newvalue = value.split(""."").pop().join(""."") + ""output"";...error: ..syntaxerror: unexpected string...update: ..nina answered it. i also had a case where i need to insert a value at the end of the string (add in a name to a file path). it's the same as above but replaces everything right before the last dot...var value = ""my.long.string"";.var result = value.split(""."").slice(0, -1).join(""."") + ""_stats."" + ""output"";"
