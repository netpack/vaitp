"why use (function(){}).call(this);? i've been studying some js libraries lately that were written by people who really knew what they were doing, and i keep seeing this pattern, and i can't find information about it. i read the docs on the .call() method, but it didn't really make sense to me. i'm hoping to get one of those good old classic in-depth so explanations with examples...(function(undefined){.   /*(insert entire library here)*/.}).call(this);...what is this about? why is this a good way to write a library?..note, sometimes the undefined is omitted, though i have no idea what difference it makes to put it there or not. i don't even know where the arguments are coming from, or who the caller is."
