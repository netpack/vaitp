"load scripts on chrome console i want to load external script on chrome console, all works fine with this code if i use it on site like google after that i click on ""load unsafe script""...for better understand..but when i use it on facebook i am getting the below error, how can avoid it?..the error..my code:..var script = document.createelement('script');.script.type = 'text/blank';.script.src = 'http://127.0.0.1/java_2.js';.document.head.appendchild(script);...and the script that i've been trying to load is really harmless....something like alert(""hello""), just for test!"
