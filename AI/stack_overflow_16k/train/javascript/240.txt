"blank click counter not going beyond 1 i have some very basic blank that is supposed to show how many times a link has been clicked and on the 5th click re-direct to a new page. it looks like this:....function counter() {.  var countercount = 0;.  var amount = document.getelementbyid(""amount"");.  countercount += 1;.  amount.innerhtml = countercount;.  if (counter === 5) {.   document.location.replace('https://developer.mozilla.org');.  }.}.&lt;a onclick=""counter()"" href=""#""&gt;i need to be clicked 5 times before i redirect&lt;/a&gt;..&lt;p id=""amount""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.....what am i doing wrong here?...why is my counter not going beyond 1?.why isn't the re-direct working?"
