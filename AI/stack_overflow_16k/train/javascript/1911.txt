"closure alternatives i run into many cases where i find myself needing to do something akin to the following..function main() {.    var x = ""something"";..    foo('do stuff', function bar(stuffresponse) {.        var y = x + stuffresponse;.    });.}...i.e. a closure where my callback function needs the variable x i defined previously. this bugs me however as i don't like that my bar function depends a variable outside of itself, but most of all because i much prefer writing my code like this instead.....function main() {.    var x = ""something"";..    foo('do stuff', bar);.}..function bar(stuffresponse) {.    var y = x + stuffresponse;.}...but obviously if i do this bar has no idea what x is anymore. is there a clean way to achieve the latter style whilst retaining the former's functionality?"
