"calling function from prototype function i have a prototype function in blank...  i'd like to be able to call another function from that prototyped function.  ..var objmap = new map(500,500);.var mycities = objmap.genvalues(5);..function map(sizex, sizey) {.    this.sizex = sizex;.    this.sizey = sizey;.}.map.prototype = {.    genvalues: function (number) {.        validatevalues(number);.    }.}..function validatevalues(num){.    alert(num);.}...in my console i get the following error:...  script438: object doesn't support property or method 'genvalues'...when i don't add the function call to validatevalues i don't get the error..is there a way to do this?  i'd like to be able to call functions in a recursive manner as well...update!..i fixed my code in the following fiddle:  i still get the same error..it sounds like i'm using the prototype functionality/methodology incorrectly as i can't call functions from within that?  is that right?"
