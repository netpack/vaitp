"blank suggesting dot notation? i've seen numerous threads about bracket vs dot notation when accessing objects....however i'm going through freecodecamp and when i'm accessing an object with a syntax such as someonesname['online'] it will suggest i should use dot notation instead?..besides being quicker.....what exactly is the benefit? everything i've seen minus ""speed"" seems to imply bracket notation is better?..is there something i'm missing? perhaps another thing that the ""dot"" operator does better?"
