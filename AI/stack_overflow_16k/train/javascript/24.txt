"how to read two shorthand if statements connected with an equal strict? i was looking through moment.min.js when i ran into an expression that looked like this:..return a ? b : c === d ? e : f...literally, i would read that as when this function is called, return the result of if a then b, else c, must strictly equal if d then e, else f, but even if that's correct, i am not sure exactly what that does...how is that read and what would the expression do?"
