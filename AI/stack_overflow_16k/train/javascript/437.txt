"help needed with blank objects i need some help with blank objects.  this is what i've got: .._genre_id = {politics:'1',sport:'2',celeb:'3',gossip:'4',busi:'5'};.var genre = 'politics';...what i want to accomplish would be to simply get the value stored for politics, in this case 1 by doing something like this: ..var genreid = _genre_id.genre;...but this of course doesn't work because the genre property doesn't exist.  i want it to relate to _genre_id.politics.  ..any ideas would be welcome."
