"how to get key of random chosen object in blank? i'm choosing a random element from an array of objects and i don't know how to get the key of that returned value. my object looks like this: ....{.    ""location"": ""la"",.    ""id"": ""34"",.    ""prizes"": {.        ""1"": {.            ""prize"": ""prize 1"",.            ""quantity"": ""6"",.            ""extracted"": """".        },.        ""3"": {.            ""prize"": ""prize 3"",.            ""quantity"": ""10"",.            ""extracted"": """".        },.        ""4"": {.            ""prize"": ""prize 4"",.            ""quantity"": ""10"",.            ""extracted"": """".        }.    }.}.....an my code where i choose random is this:....var prizes_by_locations = locations[id_prizes].prizes;.var final_prizes = [];..for(var x in prizes_by_locations){.  final_prizes.push(prizes_by_locations[x]);.}..var prize = final_prizes[math.floor(math.random()*final_prizes.length)];..//here is the random chosen prize but i need to get the key too.var chosen_prize = prize.prize;.....i also have to say that i first remove some elements, that's why the keys are 1, 3, 4."
