"blank console output issue i am trying to make a very basic ""create your own adventure"" in blank and cannot get the output that i am wanting. ..my code: ....var enter = confirm(""you are outside a forest cabin. press ok to enter."");..if (enter) {.  //go into the cabin.  var bowl = prompt(""you see three bowls of porridge. eat bowl 1, 2, or 3?"").  if (bowl == 1) {.    console.log(""it's too hot! the end"");.  } else if (bowl == 2) {.    console.log(""it's too cold! the end"");.  } else {.    console.log(""it's delicious."");..    var hours = ""the porridge makes you sleepy. nap for how many hours?"";.    var sleep = prompt(hours);.    sleep = number(sleep);..    if (sleep &lt;= 2) {.      console.log(""you wake just in time, and scamper away!"");.    } else {.      console.log(""you sleep to late, and are eaten by hungry bears."");.    }.    console.log(""the end."");..  }.} else {.  //didn't go in.  console.log(""and that's the world's shortest fable. the end."").}.....the code works when i run it however the issue is with the output. when i type in 1 for the porridge question, when prompted, it stops the code and doesn't say ""it's too hot! the end"". .is there something that i need to add that will display ""it's too hot! the end"" or any of the console.log() output in the browser? ..edit: i was expecting it to pop up like it was doing with prompt. .thank you for those that told me about alert! it is working great!"
