"how to compare 2 strings with similar characters? the below code is a minimal representation of my problem. what should be done to make the if condition true so that it prints ip addresses match!?..i know there's a problem with encoding of both strings. i am looking for an answer that converts both strings to some uniform encoding that passes the if condition.....var ip1=""127.0.0.1"";.var ip2=""127․0․0․1"";  //127%u20240%u20240%u20241.if(ip1 === ip2){. console.log(""ip addresses match!"");.}else{. console.log(""ip addresses do not match!"");.}"
