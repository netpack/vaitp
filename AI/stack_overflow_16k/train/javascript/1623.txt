"blank: value assignment to undefined case 1..say i have:..a = {}.a.x         // would return ""undefined""...however i could have..b = a.x...and the console would only return an undefined...case 2..however, if i have:..a           // would throw an error saying ""referenceerror: a is not defined""...and i can't have..b = a       // console throws tantrum insisting ""referenceerror: a is not defined""...question..what's the difference? both are undefined after all. why doesn't the first one throw an error?"
