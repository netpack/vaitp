"blank srcelement property on ie9 i have some images in a div object, when mousedown event fired i use n.srcelement to catch the image object...in firefox it would be n.target..however ie9 doesn't work on both n.target and n.srcelement because ie9 will return div object rather than image object when use n.target and n.srcelement...question is what property can be use on ie9 in order to get image object when click a image in  div object."
