"what's the difference between assigning a variable as object and assigning a variable as object literal notation/object constructor notation? i just happened to notice that when assigning a variable as an object, the typeof the variable is a 'function' whereas if i assign it as an empty object using object literal notation {} or instantiate as a new object, the typeof variable is an object..what's the difference here?  ..please note, i'm not asking the difference between object literal notation and constructor notation."
