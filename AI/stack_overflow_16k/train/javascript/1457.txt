"why is [[],[],[]] different than new array(3).fill([])? so my question is the same as in the title. i saw that someone initiated a similar thing here (if we create an array of objects using new array(len).fil({}); and then add a key in any of the objects, it gets reflected in all the 3 objects) but while everyone accused the improper method of questioning nobody gave a clear answer."
