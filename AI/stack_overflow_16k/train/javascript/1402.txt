"validate creditcard number and checked radio button blank i have radio buttons radiovisa, and radiomaster. if either one is checked, i need to first check to see which one is selected and then validate that the card number entered is valid. i also need to make sure that only numbers are entered.... i am not allowed to use any regular expression techniques.... if the radiovisa is checked, it seems to work but when i added the code for the radiomaster, if it is checked it does't work.... can someone tell me what i am doing wrong please......function isvalidcardnumber(num, isvisa, ismaster){.var card = new array();..    if (document.getelementbyid('radiovisa').checked){.        card  = isvisa;.        }.         if (num[0] != '4' ||  num.length != 16 ){..                return false;.            } else {.                return true;..            } else if (document.getelementbyid('radiomaster').checked){.        card = ismaster;.        }..         if (num[0] != '51' || num[0] != '52' ||  num[0] != '53' ||. num[0] != '54' || num[0] != '55' || num.length != 16 ){.            return false;.        } else {.            return true;.        }"
