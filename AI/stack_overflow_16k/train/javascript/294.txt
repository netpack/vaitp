"why changing input value manually can't emit input event? code is defined in attachment..i have a situation, where i have an input field and input event attached to the field...when i'm writing, removing etc. from this field, the event is emitted properly and i can react to this event...input.addeventlistener('input', () =&gt; {.    changecountervalue(charscounter, input);.});...but when i submit a form with the input, i reset the value of the input, but it actually doesn't trigger my input event...document.queryselector('form').addeventlistener('submit', (e) =&gt; {.    e.preventdefault();.    input.value = """";.  // i don't want to integrate here with charscounter module, to reset his value to 0.});...my goal is to reset the value charscounter without integreating in charscounter module, because in this moment when i submit the form, charscounter doesn't reset to 0."
