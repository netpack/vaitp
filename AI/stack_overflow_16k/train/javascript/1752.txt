"blank - using if statement for multiple conditions vs switch case i have a situation where i want to write something along the lines of this to check the page urls for a string...url example 1 - http://something.com/else/apples.url example 2 - http://something.com/else/oranges.url example 3 - http://something.com/else/bananas.....url example 10 - http://something.com/else/kiwis...pseudo code:..if(window.location.href.indexof('apples')&gt;-1).{.    alert('apples');.}.if(window.location.href.indexof('oranges')&gt;-1).{.    alert('oranges');.}........as you can see it looks rather ugly to have multiple if statements so i'm looking for some advice on how to achieve this using a single if statement or possible a switch case. i had an idea about an if statement with several 'or' statements, but i'm not sure if that's the best way of going about with this...thank you"
