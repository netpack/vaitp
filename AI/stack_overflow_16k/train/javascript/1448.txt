"how would i concatenate this variable? i'm trying to insert text data into my sqlite database. i want to use a variable to store the text that i want stored in my database. i apologize if i haven't provided enough information. i'm unaware if more information is required to solve this problem or not. here's what i have so far:..var myvar = 'the text';.tx.executesql('insert into test_table (data1) values (?)', [myvar]);...this produces an ""undefined"" for me when i query my database doing this..tx.executesql('insert into test_table (data1) values (?)', ['text here']);...when querying the database, i alert the results and the ""text here"" string is shown, so it is properly stored."
