"default value for function parameter? so i've been doing this for as long as i can remember, but i'm curious if this is really what i should be doing.  you write a function that takes a parameter, so you anticipate it to have a value, but if it doesn't, you have a good reason to default it, to say zero.  what i currently do is write a helper function:..function foo() { return foo(0); };.function foo(bar) { ... };...i just ran across an instance where i did this and i looked at it oddly for a few seconds before understanding my logic behind it.  i come from php where it's trivial:..function foo(bar=0) { ... }...is there a blank alternative that i'm not aware of?"
