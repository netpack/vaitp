"fill array with pixel location i have a logo in a header/nav tag, and when the user scrolls down, the header logo changes to a smaller image in order to shrink down the header size. the intent is to have the image load with the first class, and then changes class on scroll down, and then changes class again on scroll up. i currently have this code:..function logochange() {.    var logoimg = document.getelementbyid(""logoimg"");.    var scrolltop = document.documentelement.scrolltop || document.body.scrolltop;.    var img = document.getelementbyid(""logoimg"");..    if (scrolltop &gt; 20) {.        logoimg.setattribute(""src"", ""images/logos/ico_curve.png"");.        img.setattribute(""class"", ""favicon"");.    } else {.        logoimg.setattribute(""src"", ""images/logos/m&amp;a_logo.png"");.        img.setattribute(""class"", ""logorevert"");.    }.}..window.addeventlistener(""scroll"", logochange);...it works with the exception that as soon as the user begins to scroll, the function runs and changes the image class before i want the else block of code to execute. i only want the else clause to execute after the if clause is true...so i though about making an array populated with pixel count, but new array(21).fill(window.scrolly); populates the entire array immediately, as it should. and let pixelarray = [window.scrolly]; only populates the array with one array item...i only want the else clause to execute after the if clause is true, which is when the user has scrolled down more than 20 pixels. if there's a better way to do it than an array, let me know...thanks."
