"object comparisons in blank i would like to understand the weird behaviour of blank identity and equality operator as given below...var a = {};.var b = {};.a === b; //false.a == b;  //false..var c = '';.var d = '';.c === d; //true.c == d;  //true...all four variables a ,b ,c and d are objects. but when comparing them, first case yields false whereas second one true...i studied comparison from the following source: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d53a7bd4(v=vs.94).aspx..according to the above article, except number and boolean everything is compared by reference instead of value. so how the first case returns false and second one true."
