"blank comparison operator not evaluating user input correctly disclaimer: i'm an idiot...this is extremely simple. i must be doing something very basic wrong, but i've spent a ton of time trying to figure it out, and i'm stumped...for reference, the entire code:..&lt;html&gt;.&lt;head&gt;.&lt;meta http-equiv=""content-type"" content=""text/html; charset=iso-8859-1""&gt;.&lt;title&gt;not comparing correctly&lt;/title&gt;.&lt;/head&gt;.&lt;script&gt;..//this is the main function. it creates a new game and plays it..function playthegame() {.    ""use strict"";.    //create the game object.    var currentgame = new game();.    //play the game.    currentgame.play(document.getelementbyid(""ecurrentstake"").value, document.getelementbyid(""egoalamount"").value);.}..// this is the game object..function game(){.    //properties.    this.goalamount = 0;.    this.currentstake = 0;..    //play method plays the game and stores the results in properties.    this.play=play;.    function play(currentstake,goalamount){.        //set the relevant properties to values passed to the object.        this.goalamount = goalamount;.        this.currentstake = currentstake;.        alert(this.currentstake+"" &lt; ""+this.goalamount+"" :""+(this.currentstake &lt; this.goalamount));.    };.}.&lt;/script&gt;..&lt;body&gt;.    enter current stake: &lt;input type=""text"" id=""ecurrentstake""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br&gt;.    enter goal amount: &lt;input type=""text"" id=""egoalamount""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br&gt;..    &lt;button type=""button"" onclick=""playthegame()""&gt;let's play!&lt;/button&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;...the part of the code that's giving me trouble:..alert(this.currentstake+"" &lt; ""+this.goalamount+"" :""+(this.currentstake &lt; this.goalamount));...when i put 9 and 10 into the input text fields, i get a, ""false,"" output..but 10 and 50 does return true. in short: the result is unpredictable. i think it might be evaluating as a string, but when i researched it, all i can find is that blank has dynamic data types and will compare variables as numbers if they are numbers. ie :..http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp..so, where am i going wrong?"
