"document.head and document.getelementsbytagname(""head"")[0] strange behavior i can't figure out what's wrong with this code.  after defining a script like this:..var script = document.createelement('script');.script.src = 'http://example.com/file.js';.script.type = 'text/blank';.script.onload = function(){.    //code to execute after script loads.}...i then have the following line:..(document.head || document.getelementsbytagname(""head"")[0]).appendchild(script);...for some reason, i am getting very odd inconsistent behavior where it seems that the onload function is being called before the file.js is actually loaded. there are variables contained in file.js that i use in the onload function, and every so often, the function executes before those variables are defined according to the error console...if i change the last line to:..document.head.appendchild(script);...or..document.getelementsbytagname(""head"")[0].appendchild(script);...the problem seems to go away. ..the problem also goes away if i assign it to a variable before appending:..var head = document.head || document.getelementsbytagname(""head"")[0];.head.appendchild(script);...why is this happening?"
