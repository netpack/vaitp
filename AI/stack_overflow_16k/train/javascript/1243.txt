"createelement + createtextnode oneliner? i'm adding a few thousand rows to a table so i need the speed of native blank for this one...currently i'm using:..nthname = document.createelement(""th"");.nthname.appendchild(document.createtextnode(workers[i].name));.ntr.appendchild(nthname);...is there a way to do this in one line (without losing any performance?) so i don't need the nthname variable? ..there are over 50 cells on each row so i would prefer:..ntr.appendchild(document.createelement(""th"").appendchild(document.createtextnode(workers[i].name)));...but that don't work.. obviously"
