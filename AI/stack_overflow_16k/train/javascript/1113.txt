"does setting an item in a weakmap modify the key itself? in blank, does setting an item in a weakmap alter the object used as the key?..the reason i ask is that, if i were to implement a weakmap, then i might stick a symbol on the key, and then use this to key into the value. in this way no memory reference would be maintained from the weakmap to the value......and i can't think of any other way of doing it...the following works, indicating that if the key is modified, it is not modified in a normal userland fashion?....const o= object.freeze({}).const m = new weakmap..m.set(o, 'this is o')..console.log(m.has(o)) // true"
