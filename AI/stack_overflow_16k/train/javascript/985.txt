"extract object from object array i need to split an object array into two variables. the first variable (main) should get the object with a title..the second one (content) should get all other objects...sample data..[.  { _id: '1', title: 'main' },.  { _id: '2', foo: 'bar' },.  { _id: '2', foo: 'bar' }.]...i did it withfind()/filter() commands, but is it really necessary to find twice?..const main = data.find(doc =&gt; doc.title).const content = data.filter(doc =&gt; !doc.title)...is it possible to extract the main object instead of finding it?"
