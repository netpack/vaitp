"add quotations to a key in blank let's say i have this code:..var testobjs = ['this is one test', 'a sapphire road', 'ragon done 12'];.var sampleanswer = ['hello', 'world', '123'];..var complexobj = {};..for (var i = 0; i &lt; testobjs.length; i++) {.  complexobj[testobjs[i]] = sampleanswer[i];.}..console.log(complexobj);...this creates an object with a value. both are dynamically created and thus, we have this object:..{.    a sapphire road: ""world"".    ragon done 12: ""123"".    this is one test: ""hello"".}...as you can see, the problem is that there is no double quotations. i want it to be like this (so it is valid): ..{.    ""a sapphire road"": ""world"".    ""ragon done 12"": ""123"".    ""this is one test"": ""hello"".}...how would i go about doing it?"
