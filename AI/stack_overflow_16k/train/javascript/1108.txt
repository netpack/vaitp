"are functions defined regardless of the order? i'm not really a blank noob at all, although in my whole life i've never came across this, but am i right in assuming that blank must assign functions before running anything or something?..in all my experience, i expected this to return 'undefined', but obviously it returns 'function'...function bar() {.    return foo;.    foo = 10;.    function foo() {}.    var foo = '11';.}.alert(typeof bar());...is someone able to explain this for me?"
