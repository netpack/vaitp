mismatch between system's time and date.tolocaletimestring update: the issue existed on android chrome 58. upgrading chrome resolved it. i'd still like to know what was causing this issue...i'm browsing this link on my android phone and it shows:..date: ... 00:55:23.date.tolocaletimestring(): 11:55:23 pm ...my locale is de_de and correct time showing at the top of my phone is indeed 00:55...how is this possible? isn't 00:55 just 12:55 ?
