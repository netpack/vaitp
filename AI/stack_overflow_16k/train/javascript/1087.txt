"setinterval function is not creating delay in blank code hi everyone i am having trouble using the setinterval function. i have it set to 10 seconds in each of the situations below, however the functions inside are executing as fast as they normally would. i am new to blank could someone tell me what i am doing wrong?..setinterval(function() {.  if (temparray.length == 4) {..    var counter = 0;.    var sum = 0;.    //console.log(""counting average..."");..    for (var i = 0; i &lt; temparray.length; i++) {.      sum += temparray[i]; //add each temperature together .      counter++;.    }.  }..  var average = (sum / counter).tofixed(2);.  setinterval(function() {.    var avgstring = ""data reveived, the average temperature is "" + average + ""*c"";...    console.log(avgstring);.    io.emit('chat message', avgstring);.  }, 10000);.}, 10000);"
