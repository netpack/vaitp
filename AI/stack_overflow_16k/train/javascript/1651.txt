"blank pull down menu i would like to create three pull down menus..... this is how they would look. continents would be the first pull down menu, the second would be countries, so if one picks from the first say africa, the second would have only the countries in africa. and when one clicks the second one, that is picking a country ... say sudan, then the third pull down will have states/provinces in sudan...how do i do this? i want something that is simple and basic?..i will store it in blank data type ... {""north america"":[the usa, canada] , ""africa"":[""kenya"", ""tunsia"", ""morroco""]}"
