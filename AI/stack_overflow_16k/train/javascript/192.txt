"get records for a particular hour and an average of corresponding data i call a webservice and get data. the data is in the format - ..mail: ""xyz@xyz.com"".price: ""9.5"".name: ""xyz"".receiveddate: ""1374484561920""...i convert the date in millis to date and find the hour in which price was something. so eachentrydate has the hour i.e 11, 12, 13 etc...for(var l=0; l&lt;data.length; l++){.    var datadate = recs[l].receiveddate;.    datadate = +datadate;.    var eachentrydate = new date(+datadate.tostring());.    eachentrydate = eachentrydate.tostring();.    eachentrydate = parseint(eachentrydate.substr(16, 2));.    hourlyrecs[l] = {hour:eachentrydate, price:recs[l].price};.}...now i want to get the average of the price for each hour. i.e. the average of the price where the hour is 11,12 etc. the data is in a random order. what is the best way to do this?"
