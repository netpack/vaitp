"how can i pass function's return value as parameter? i have lots of functions similar to functionone. difference in these is five = this.methodtwo(two, three, four, five). i don't want to repeat code. for doing that, how can i pass function's return value as parameter?..class myclass {.    functionone(one, two, three, four, five) {.        //some code here.        one = ""my one"";.        two = ""my two"";.        five = this.functiontwo(two, three, four, five); //how can i pass this as parameter.        one[five] = ""something"";.        return one;.    }.    functionthree(one, two, three, four, five) {.        //some code here.        one = ""my one"";.        two = ""my two"";.        five = this.functionfour(two, three, four, five); //everything in functionthree is same as functionone except this statement.        one[five] = ""something"";.        return one;.    }..    functiontwo(two, three, four, five) {.        //some code.        return five;.    }.}"
