"calling blank function with the syntax (0, myfunction)() i'm very new in the blank, but i found the syntax (0, myfunction)() to call anonymous functions on blank, but i don't know what means the 0 before the anonymous function, also i don't know if instead of 0 i can use 1 or 2, etc...basically my question is what is the difference between call a function myfuntion() or (0, myfunction)(). the function is in a global context...here is an example...var object = {}.object.foo = function(){}...the difference between call the function..(0,object.foo)();...or..object.foo();"
