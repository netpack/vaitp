"get member of global object using string i have a global blank object which has submembers and i need to access it's members by a provided string. the object looks like:..var student = {.    0 : {.        name : ""a"",.        level : 2.      }.    1 : {.        name : ""b"",.        level : 3.      }.      ......and i want to access it like when using the top level as a string:..   this[""student[0]['name']""];   // returns undefined.   window[""student[0]['name']""]; // same here...but this is only working for the variable names:..  this[""student""];    // returns the student object.  window[""student""];  // same...can this be done? or what is the correct way to get the member defined with ..var accesskey = 'student[0][""name""]';...thank you."
