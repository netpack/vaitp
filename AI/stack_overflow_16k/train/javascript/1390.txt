"js - setinterval runs for a single instance i am sorry i know this is a repetitive question, but i cant seem to get this right for some reason. ....function timer() {.  console.log(""over here"").};..window.setinterval(timer, 5000);.....i believe this is a fairly easy example im trying to implement but it only runs once. sorry again if i am missing an obvious detail or something...this is the results it generates after the 6th second"
