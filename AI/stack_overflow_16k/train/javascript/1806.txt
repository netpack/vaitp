"full conversion of object to array of keys and values: better solution? although the topic of converting js objects to js arrays as long been dealt with here, my question is about algorithm optimization...let my object be..   myobject = {.        ""key q"": ""value q"",.        ""key p"": ""value p"",.        ""key g"": ""value g"" };...to be converted into an js array, including both keys and values..so far, i have devised this:..var myarr = [];.var astring = json.stringify(myobject);.astring = astring.substring (1, (astring.length-1)); // let's get rid of the braces.myarr = astring.replace (/:/gi, ',');...it all works smoothly, but is there some faster way than undergoing these (allegedly) slow string methods?"
