"blank: how to have value in string represented by %s and then replaced with a value i know this a really stupid question...i've had a good few years experience with blank but this one thing seems to have skipped my mind, my head has gone blank and i can't remember what it's called and how i would go about doing it...basically what i'm looking for is when you have a string variable such as:..var error_message = ""an account already exists with the email: %s""...and you then pass a string somehow into this and it replaces the %s...i probably sound really idiotic, but i'd really appreciate the help / reminding!..thanks guys."
