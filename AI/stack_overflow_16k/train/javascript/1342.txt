"blank handles $ key and end key , as code --> 36. how to differentiate? i have written a java-script function, in which i'm checking which key is pressed for the ""onkeypress"" event of a text-box...if (key==35 || key==36).       return true; // return true only if the key pressed is home or end.......but, if a user enters key # or $, then also the above function returns true. as # stands for 35 and &amp; stands for 36. which is incorrect as per my requirement...my question, is how can i differentiate between these two types in java-script...please help...here is the entire code:-..aspx:- ..&lt;telerik:radtextbox id=""txtempname"" runat=""server"" maxlength=""255""&gt;.     &lt;clientevents onkeypress=""alphabetonly"" /&gt;.&lt;/telerik:radtextbox&gt;...blank:-..&lt;script language=""blank"" type=""text/blank""&gt;.function alphabetonly(sender, eventargs).{.    if (key==35 || key==36).           return true;.}.&lt;/script&gt;"
