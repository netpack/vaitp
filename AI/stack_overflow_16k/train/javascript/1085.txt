"why isprototypeof returning false, yet i can go up the prototype chain? maybe my understanding of prototype inheritance is off.  its interesting that i am inheriting from my object, but still returns false.  sorry if this is a dumb question to those that are going to thumbs down me.  ..yes, i purposely spelled out my variables and or objects for demonstration purposes and yes i purposely am attempting to use .create as oppose to new ().    ..var vehicleprototype = {.   type: ""car"".};..var carprototype = object.create(vehicleprototype);..carprototype.wheels = null;.carprototype.make = null;.carprototype.model = null;..var jamescar = object.create(carprototype);..var x = jamescar.type.alert(x);..alert(object.isprototypeof(jamescar, vehicleprototype));  //false"
