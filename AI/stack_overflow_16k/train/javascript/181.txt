"blank to search for unique objects and pull sum from values i'm very familiar with powershell but now i'm trying to tackle learning blank. ..so in powershell, i have a variable that i'm doing a where-object -eq value and doing a measure to get the total sum of all the values with that object name..(($marketplacecharges | where-object {$_.ordernumber -eq ""cf322da4-ddba-48e0-84a7-61cc7663d012""})).extendedcost | measure-object -sum...within blank i have an each which is presenting me with all the objects, not the ones that are unique only to that ordernumber.._.each(azure_resources, function(ar){.    result.push({.      subscriptionguid: ar[""subscriptionguid""],.      subscriptionname: ar[""subscriptionname""],.      usagestartdate: ar[""usagestartdate""],.      usageenddate: ar[""usageenddate""].      costcenter: ar[""costcenter""],.      accountname: ar[""accountname""],.      departmentname: ar[""departmentname""],.      publishername: ar[""publishername""].      planname: ar[""planname""].      instanceid: ar[""instanceid""].      consumedquantity: ar[""consumedquantity""].      resourcerate: ar[""resourcerate""].      extendedcost: ar[""extendedcost""].    }).})...how would i go about creating a filter that finds all unique order numbers then does a filter for everyone regardless of how many of the same order and sum up the extendedcost?..thanks for your help in advance!"
