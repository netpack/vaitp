"evaluation of bitwise operator i don't really get why a * 51 &amp; 52 evaluates to false for 9, 14, 19, 24 in the code beneath. i understand that the interval is 5 but why is 51 and 52 used and what numbers would i use for e.g. an interval of 6?..for(               // loop :).      b=a='';        // b - result , a - numeric variable.      a++&lt;36;        // .      b+=a*51&amp;52  // if ""a"" is not 9 or 14 or 19 or 24.                  ?  //  return a random number or 4.         (.           a^15      // if ""a"" is not 15.              ?      // genetate a random number from 0 to 15.           8^math.random()*.           (a^20?16:4)  // unless ""a"" is 20, in which case a random number from 8 to 11.              :.           4            //  otherwise 4.           ).tostring(16).                  :.         '-'            //  in other cases (if ""a"" is 9,14,19,24) insert ""-"".      );.return b...update 25/08/2014 at 15:35: sorry, maybe my question was a bit unclear. i wanted a logical or mathematical explanation why the bitwise comparison only evaluates to false for 9, 14, 19, 24. i'm aware of what the bitwise operator does and how it works but i really don't get the logic of the used pattern above. the code is actually taken from a gist to generate random v4 uuids (see https://gist.github.com/leverone/1308368) and i would name it size optimised code rather than obfuscated code."
