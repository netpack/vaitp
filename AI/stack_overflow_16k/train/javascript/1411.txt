"why don't nested objects in blank preserve their values? i am running two tests to check how objects worked in blank:..tests one:....//method 1.var player = {..  name: """",.  id: """",.  action: {.    action1: """",.    action2: """",.    action3: """".  }.}..var player1 = object.create(player);.player1.name = "" hack"";.player1.id = 1;.player1.action.action1 = ""aaa"";.player1.action.action2 = ""aaa"";.player1.action.action3 = ""aaa"";.console.log(json.stringify(player1.action));..var player2 = object.create(player);.player2.name = "" jason"";.player2.id = 2;.player2.action.action1 = ""bbb"";.player2.action.action2 = ""bbb"";.player2.action.action3 = ""bbb"";..console.log(json.stringify(player2.action));.console.log(json.stringify(player1.action));.....the result is:..          {""action1"":""aaa"",""action2"":""aaa"",""action3"":""aaa""}. vm174:29 {""action1"":""bbb"",""action2"":""bbb"",""action3"":""bbb""}. vm174:30 {""action1"":""bbb"",""action2"":""bbb"",""action3"":""bbb""}...you can see the action object of player1 had been changed by creating player2...what if i want the action object preserve it's value?..the only way i can think about is following:....//medthod 2 .var actionmanager = {..  action1: """",.  action2: """",.  action3: """"..}.var player = {..  name: """",.  id: """",.  action: null.}..var player1 = object.create(player);.var actions1 = object.create(actionmanager);.actions1.action1 = ""aaa"";.actions1.action2 = ""aaa"";.actions1.action3 = ""aaa"";..player1.name = "" hack"";.player1.id = 1;.player1.action = actions1;.console.log(json.stringify(player1));.var player2 = object.create(player);.player2.name = "" jason"";.player2.id = 2;..var actions2 = object.create(actionmanager);.actions2.action1 = ""bbb"";.actions2.action2 = ""bbb"";.actions2.action3 = ""bbb"";..player2.action = actions2;.console.log(json.stringify(player2));.console.log(json.stringify(player1));.....in this case the output is:..{""name"":""hack"",""id"":1,""action:{""action1"":""aaa"",""action2"":""aaa"",""action3"":""aaa""}} ..{""name"":"" jason"",""id"":2,""action:{""action1"":""bbb"",""action2"":""bbb"",""action3"":""bbb""}}..{""name"":"" hack"",""id"":1,""action"":{""action1"":""aaa"",""action2"":""aaa"",""action3"":""aaa""}}...is there any better way to use method 1 but make the action object not being changed?"
