"blank: nesting objects, and accessing the parent(s) i'm trying to nest blank objects:..manager (singleton).    tab group.        tab.            trigger (button).            target (panel).        tab.            trigger.            target.        tab.            trigger.            target.    tab group.        ......in the trigger and target objects, i need to have access to the parent tab, grandparent tab group, and root manager...one option: navigate 1 level at a time:..// in a trigger.this.tab.this.tab.group.this.tab.group.manager..// in a tab.this.group.this.group.manager..// and group.this.manager...another option:  i could make them all accessible directly:..// in a trigger.this.tab.this.group.this.manager...do either of these make sense?  it seems like this would be a common problem.  do any libraries like underscore or backbone have a better solution?  is it common practice to pass the parent to the child in the constructor??..edit:  after posting, and rethinking, option 1 seems acceptable.  can anyone confirm?"
