"blank replace part with part of part in string? i have a string something like..http://string.com/__11_22__/stuff...and i need to take this string and replace it with part of it so i end up with..http://string.com/11/stuff...or..http://string.com/22/stuff...depending upon a if statement (is country blah or blah2). so if country is blah i would end up with ...11/... if country is blah2 i would end up with ...22/.....but i am a little confused with how to do it, the format will always be the same, two _ followed by two digits followed by a _ and 2 more digits then 2 more _"
