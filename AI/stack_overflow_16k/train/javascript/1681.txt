"blank always run a function on the longest array, and use the shortest inside that function the following function should always compare all the items in the longest array and see if they exist in the shorter one...now the following code works, but it's a bit verbose. ..const findsimilar = (arr1, arr2) =&gt; {.  const arrlongest = (arr1.length &lt; arr2.length) ? arr2 : arr1;.  const arrshortest = (arr1.length &lt; arr2.length) ? arr1 : arr2;.  return arrlongest.filter((arrlongestitem) =&gt; arrshortest.includes(arrlongestitem));.};..console.log(findsimilar([1,2,3,4,3], [1,2,3])); // (3) [1, 2, 3, 3].console.log(findsimilar([1,2,3], [1,2,3,4,3])); // (4) [1, 2, 3, 3]...is it necessary to have the two variables arrlongest and arrshortest? or is there another way."
