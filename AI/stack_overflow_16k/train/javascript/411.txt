"blank string parser calculator i am working on a blank where i have the string:..var raw = ""123 + 32 − 65"";...i am trying to build a calculator, but i'm trying to figure out the best place to start. should i split this into an array?..var split = raw.split("" "");.// ['123', '+', '32', '−', '65']...but then that's going to be a ton of if statements...what is the best logical way to create a calculator parser given this string?"
