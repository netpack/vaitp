"blank promise - one of my promises function returns undefined, however other similar function works and payload is returned i'm working on promise. i have constated than one of my promise - the () =&gt; console.log(""first callback"")  returns undefined on nodejs  console and browser's console. i wonder why since there is a value to return and their payload. ..here my snippet :....var promise1 = new promise(function(resolve, reject) {.  settimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo', .             () =&gt; console.log(""first callback""), // returns undefined.             console.log(""second callback""),.             console.log(""...n callback""));.});..promise1.then((data) =&gt; console.log(""promise data: "", data));.....if someone have any hint on why it returns undefined, would be great,..thanks"
