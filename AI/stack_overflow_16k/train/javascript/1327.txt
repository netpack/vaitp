"why do people use settimeout(""func()"", ... ) instead of settimeout(func, ... ) i see this used a lot and i was told putting the function reference between quotes was bad because settimeout/setinterval evals the reference. what is the actual difference between these two such that one is used over the other and why do i see this used so frequently even though it should be common knowledge that this one way is bad?"
