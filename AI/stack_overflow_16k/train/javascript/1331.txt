"make object's properties available inside function i would like to do the following.i have a code like this:..var obj = {.    method : function() {}.};...var func = function() {.    return method(); //method is undefined here.};..func(); // what to do here?...is it possible to call func in a way that it will see the method inside from obj as it was given for example as a parameter. i want to use obj.method inside func, without writing 'obj.' before and without modifying func itself. is there any hack possible to achieve this?.in other words, is it possible to force obj as a closure into func?.i tried:..with(obj) {.    func();.}...but it doesn't work. anyone, any ideas? or is it the only option to get the body of the function as string, put 'with(obj)' inside it and then create a new function out of it?..clarification:.because this code will be in a helper class 'eval' is ok. which i don't want is the modification of the function through .tostring(), because browsers implement it differently."
