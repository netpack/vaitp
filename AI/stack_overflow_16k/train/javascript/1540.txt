"read text file on server into array blank here's the situation. on the apache box there's a text file that contains numbers with new lines:.eg:..25.34.76...etc......what i'm wanting to do it grab the values from that file and use them to ""set"" some sliders i have which are partially yoinked from http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/slider/slider.html..once done i'll have a ""commit"" button which writes out the altered values to that text file...but i'm getting stuck at the bit where you read from the text file on the apache box which this runs in..everything i've read seems to refer to file uploading via an api but this isn't what i want as the file is server side...i guess i could use php but as i'm not up on that either (and especially not on how to move variables between the two) ..any ideas? if you need clarification i can give it to you."
