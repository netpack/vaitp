"error using clienty when vertical scrollbar exists i am trying to popup a div whenever a span with id toolpopup is clicked (div should appear at those coordinates) and it works fine for the spans which are at the top of the page. but when i scroll down and click the span the div is created but not at the desired coordinates. what could be possibly wrong? i am trying it on firefox 7.0.1..$(""#toolpopup"").live(""click"", function(event) {.    var x = event.clientx;.    var y = event.clienty;.    $(""#popup"").css('position', 'absolute');.    $(""#popup"").css(""top"", y);.    $(""#popup"").css(""left"", x);.    $(""#popup"").css(""display"",""block"");.});"
