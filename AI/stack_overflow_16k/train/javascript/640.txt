"why is the apply() function needed in the constructor function set() {          // this is the constructor.    this.values = {};     .    this.n = 0;          .    this.add.apply(this, arguments);  // all arguments are values to add.}..// add each of the arguments to the set..set.prototype.add = function() {.    /* code to add properties to the object's values property */.    return this;.};...this is the beginning of the code used in ""blank: the definitive guide"" to create a 'set' class.  i've tried to rationalize the necessity of the apply() function in the constructor but can not figure it out for the life of me...this.add.apply(this, arguments);...if the add() function is already a method called by 'this' then what purpose or use is the core apply() function fulfilling.  thanks in advance to anyone who attempts to explain this to me..http://jsfiddle.net/marlin/ydwgv/ - full example from blank: the definitive guide"
