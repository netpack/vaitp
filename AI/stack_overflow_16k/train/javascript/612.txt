"passing parameters to the function in settimeout i want to call a function in a cycle with settimeout(), and also pass the counter as a parameter. here's what i tried:..&lt;!doctype html&gt;.&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;..&lt;button onclick=""timed1()""&gt;display alerts&lt;/button&gt;..&lt;script&gt;.function timed1() {. for (i=1; i&lt;4; i++){.  settimeout(.     (function(i){ alert(i) })(i), 1000*i.   );. }.}.&lt;/script&gt;..&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;...function calls are done with correct values, but immediately instead of the intervals i wanted. i have read this and this so questions but unfortunately don't see yet what should i change in my case."
