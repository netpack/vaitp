"using an image as as fill in js instead of color (without displaying it upon load) i'm building a brick-breaker type game in blank where i want to use images as a fill instead of colors, and the only info i can find about how to do that involves displaying the image first, and then using it in a js method call, which is not what i want to do. basically, i want all of the images i choose to display as 'bricks' upon page load. here is my working code for colors. just want to replace it with images. thanks!..function drawbricks() {.for(c=0; c&lt;brickcolumncount; c++) {.    for(r=0; r&lt;brickrowcount; r++) {.        if(bricks[c][r].status == 1) {       .            var brickx = (c*(brickwidth+brickpadding))+brickoffsetleft;.            var bricky = (r*(brickheight+brickpadding))+brickoffsettop;.            bricks[c][r].x = brickx;.            bricks[c][r].y = bricky;.            ctx.beginpath();.            ctx.rect(brickx, bricky, brickwidth, brickheight);.            ctx.fillstyle = ""#0095dd"";.            ctx.fill();.            ctx.closepath();.        }.    }.}...}"
