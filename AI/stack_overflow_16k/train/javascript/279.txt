"am i assigning a reference to a function or a function in string form? assigning a function handler to a variable leads me to believe that my variable is now a reference to my function.  while this all seems fine and dandy, why can i concatenate a string with my ""reference"" and why is this concatenation reflected when i write my ""reference"" to the screen?..why is my function reference being both handled and written as a string?..what is going on behind the scenes with references and type?    ....var x = tester;..document.getelementbyid(""test_button"").onclick = x;..document.getelementbyid(""test_p"").innerhtml += (x + ""&lt;br&gt;"");.x += ""did i just concatenate a string?"";.document.getelementbyid(""test_p"").innerhtml += (x);..function tester() {.  document.write(""hello world!"");.}.&lt;button id=""test_button""&gt;press me&lt;/button&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;p id=""test_p""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.....i assign the reference as an onclick for a button, and the function still executes as expected...[press me] .function tester() { document.write(""hello world!""); }.function tester() { document.write(""hello world!""); }did i just concatenate .a string?...above is output, and when the button is pressed ""hello world!"" is written to the screen."
