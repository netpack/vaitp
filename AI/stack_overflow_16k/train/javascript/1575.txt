"regex for replacing mailto links (blank) i want to write a blank function to replace href tags that contain a mailto link...&lt;a href=""mailto:foo@bar.com""&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;!...should become:..&lt;a href=""&amp;lt;%='mailto:foo@bar.com'%&amp;gt;""&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;!...this is for an application that feeds html into a third-party service, and the service is broken in that it won't accept mailto urls, but if we mask it as a variable, it will accept it. i'm just having a hard time wrapping my non-regex-friendly brain around only replacing the inner part of the href tags...thanks so much for your help!"
