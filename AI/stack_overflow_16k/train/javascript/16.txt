"onclick firing on page load, need to call function with parameters sorry if this may be deemed a slight duplicate, however i couldn't find an answer that helped me understand why myfunc() is firing on page load and not when i click el1 or el2.  how can i make the following code behave as expected?..function myfunc(param){.    //yadayada.}..el1.onclick = myfunc('string1');.el2.onclick = myfunc('string2');...thanks."
