"is it possible to control programs with blank? i am making an html/blank browser homepage, that could be downloaded to any computer - you simply run the *.html file from your computer and it opens in your default browser; in it you have a compact homepage, with several options - you can make a bookmark list, write notes etc. you can leave it opened as it is just a separate tab...i'm wondering whether it's possible to use blank in order to open, for example, windows media player or make it possible for the user to set a default music player. or even close the previously opened program? could this be done?..i think it would be best if the user could just set the default programs. getting the file location is not the problem, is anything else needed?"
