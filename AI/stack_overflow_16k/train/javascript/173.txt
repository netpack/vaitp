"blank function not always firing i have a blank function which fires towards the end of a page load.  it looks like this.....&lt;script language=""blank"" type=""text/blank""&gt;.    showadverts();.&lt;/script&gt;...so in other words it fires without the user interaction...i've never had any problem with this but recently a few of our customers are not seeing the results of this function which leads me to bleive that on some browsers it's sometimes blocked.  the prob has now occurred on ff, chrome and ie and would therfore appear to be browser independent...any ideas as to the random nature of this problem ?..thanks in advance"
