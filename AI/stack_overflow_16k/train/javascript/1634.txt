"blank:history.back() or homepage i would like to add a button that will take a user back a page or if a user used direct url to get to that page (so, .back() would take them back to google for example) - a user will be redirected to my homepage...looks like blank:history:back() or history.go accept step attributes only (how many pages we can go back) and that is it. will i have to tap into session or is there a way to do it with history object?"
