"understanding nested if statements in the rock, paper, scissors codeacademy blank excercise so i've moved on to 6/9 in the codeacademy blank rock paper scissors excercise and although i've passed it i don't feel 100% confident on nested if statements. i'm starting to log the possible outcomes and this is the code which i passed with:.. var compare = function (choice1, choice2) {.    if (choice1 == choice2) {.        return (""the result is a tie!""); .    }.    if (choice1 == ""rock"") {.       if (choice2 == ""scissors"") {.           return(""rock wins""); .       } else {.          return(""paper wins""); }.    }. }...my main query is why? could you not replace all the nested if statements with just elseif statements instead? i don't feel like i'd know when to use nested if statements."
