"return an array with the following format: [lowestkey, highestkey] i am trying to return an array with the following format: [lowestkey, highestkey]. what would be the easiest way to go about doing this? i went with a for loop (that is not finished yet), and am kind of at a loss as to what to do next?..for clarity: the function is supposed to accept an object and return an array of lowest and highest key...here is what i have so far:....function minmaxkeyinobject(arr) {.  let min = arr[0].y, max = arr[0].y;..  for (let i = 1, len=arr.length; i &lt; len; i++) {.    let v = arr[i].y;.    min = (v &lt; min) ? v : min;.    max = (v &gt; max) ? v : max;.  }..  return [min, max];.}..console.log(.  minmaxkeyinobject({ 2: 'a', 7: 'b', 1: 'c', 10: 'd', 4: 'e' }),.  minmaxkeyinobject({ 1: 'elie', 4: 'matt', 2: 'tim' }).  );.....i am trying to return [1, 10] and [1, 4]"
