"clarification on filter() function; how it works so, i am self-learning html, css, blank. i was going through arrow functions and found the following code on mdn website but i am not sure if i understand it clearly how the filter() function works. this is how i understand it: the ""word"" is the parameter of testfunct() and the arguments are the elements of wrds array and they are passed to testfunct(word). is it like filter function loops through each elements of the array(arguments) and assesses the requirement(word.length > 6)? like with normal(to me that's normal as i am a beginner) argument/parameter pair, let's say you pass 2 arguments and there are 2 parameters to receive them. thank you...var wrds = ['spray', 'limit', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];..//const result = words.filter(word =&gt; word.length &gt; 6);..//write the arrow function as full function to see if you understood how it works. ..const result = wrds.filter(function testfunct(word) {return word.length &gt; 6;});..console.log(result); .... prints 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present"
