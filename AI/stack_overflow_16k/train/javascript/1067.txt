"elements moving to randomly move to pre-established positions on a list for a computer science class, i’m making a simple 4 screen game (home, game, win, lose screen). i went with “whack a mole” because it seemed pretty simple but i’ve been stuck for the past day. i have 6 holes and a mole and i would for the mole to move randomly to one of the other holes. i have no idea how to make it possible. is it possible to make a list with 6 positions (6holes) and then make the program choose one of the positions randomly for the mole to move to??"
