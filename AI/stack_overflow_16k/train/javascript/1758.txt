check odd numbers without modulo operator i am creating a function that returns whether the passed in number is odd without the modulo operator. the tricky part is that it should work for negative numbers and zero...here's my codes so far:..function testodd(num) {.  return (num/2)*2==num;.}..var output = testodd(17);.console.log(output); // --&gt; true...am i making some mistakes here? or is there a better way to do this?
