"how do you use blank to populate a text field with data based on a select box? i know a good amount of php, but know very little of blank...basically, what i want is:..if a user selects item x from an html form select box, then the descriptive text for item x will auto populate an html form input text box below it...does anyone have a working sample that i can use or edit to be able to do what i need?"
