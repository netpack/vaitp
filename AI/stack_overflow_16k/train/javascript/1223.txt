"adding and removing event listeners with argument bearing functions alright, first time posting here. i have been looking at posts regarding this issue for days now and i can't find a fix...i have a matrix of images (basically arranged spheres) with unique id's. i want to add different functionalities to said spheres. so i proceed to add event listeners. all good so far. after the first event is triggered  i want all the spheres to change their event listener, so i proceed to remove all event listeners and add new ones. i cannot remove the event listeners...adding event:..for (let i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++) {.    for (let j = 0; j &lt; 11; j++) {.        if ((i &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; i &lt; 9 &amp;&amp; j &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 9) &amp;&amp; checkcorners(i, j) === true) {.            let ball = document.getelementbyid(i.tostring() + j.tostring());.            ball.addeventlistener('click', removeball(i, j));.        }.    }.}...removeball():..var removeball = function(i, j) {.    return function curried_func(ii, jj) {.        let ball = document.getelementbyid(i.tostring() + j.tostring());.        ball.src = ""./public/assets/ball_empty.png"";.    }.}...i'm using the curried function method because it's the last method i have tried, besides retrieving object data from the e (event) argument, which did not seem to work as e was undefined. or using a handler. or  using binding...removing event:..for (let i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++) {.    for (let j = 0; j &lt; 11; j++) {.        if ((i &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; i &lt; 9 &amp;&amp; j &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 9) &amp;&amp; checkcorners(i, j) === true) {.            let ball = document.getelementbyid(i.tostring() + j.tostring());.            // ball.somethingtorevmoveevent?.        }.    }.}...i do feel the need to mention it's also my first blank serious project so if anyone has a better solution or workaround (instead of adding and removing events 100 times for functionalities) please do share...matrix for reference.-the user should remove 1 ball , at which point the spot turns black, and then any ball can jump over another to fill the empty spot (the ""jumped over ball"" gets removed). i think it's a chinese checker puzzle of some kind."
