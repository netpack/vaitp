"time complexity of blank es6 backtick operator var1 = ""string1"".var2 = ""string2"".....varn = ""stringn""..var str = `${var1}${var2}${var3}${var4}...${varn}`;...1.what is the time complexity of getting str in above expression, given vari is an string? ..2.how fast is it in comparison with concatenating strings using for loop?..edit1: added wiki link..edit2: another example as said by  @patrickroberts. it is my actual use case as well:..i am using node and i need to respond to client with an xml payload. they have already given me the format of xml and respective xsds. these are big and nested  xmls. i have data (in json) which i will ""fill"" in xml template (as string) using backtick operator. i want to avoid blocking node thread as much as i can. ..as a dummy example:..let response = .`&lt;catalog&gt;.    &lt;cd&gt;.        &lt;title&gt;${data.title}&lt;/title&gt;.        &lt;artist&gt;${data.artist}&lt;/artist&gt;.        &lt;country&gt;${data.country}&lt;/country&gt;.        &lt;company&gt;${data.company}&lt;/company&gt;.        &lt;price&gt;${data.price}&lt;/price&gt;.        &lt;year&gt;${data.year}&lt;/year&gt;.    &lt;/cd&gt;.&lt;catalog&gt;.`"
