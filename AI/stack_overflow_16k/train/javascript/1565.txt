"references & scope in anonymous functions i'm new to object oriented blank. i have a simple class, what seems to be in blank a function. my class has two members and some methods:..function webapp() {.  //members.  this.websocket = null;.  this.workdata = null;..  //constructor.  $( 'document' ).ready(function() {.    $('#wait').show();.    this.initializewebsocket();.  });..  this.geturlparameter = function(sparam).  {.    //retrieves get-parameter.  }..  this.initializewebsocket = function() {.        //websocket connection.      }.}.var app = new webapp();...when the anonymous function for document.ready runs i get the following error:.uncaught referenceerror: initializewebsocket is not defined..i understand the exception because this is in this scope document. i am able to call the function on this way:..app.initializewebsocket();...but on this way i cannot instantiate more than one object of webapp. .is it possible to pass the this- webappinstance as a reference into the anonymous function?"
