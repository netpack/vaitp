"incrementing a for loop by decimal value i'm trying to implement a for loop that increments by 0.1. i have one that seems to work just fine for an increment of 0.5. although this may be a 'false positive' since the one for 0.1 gives me some strange values for i?   ..function thisisi() {.    var x = 1;..    for (var i = (x+0.1); i &lt; 2; i += 0.1) {.        console.log('i', i);.    }..};...seems to yield:..i 1.1.i 1.2000000000000002.i 1.3000000000000003.i 1.4000000000000004.i 1.5000000000000004.i 1.6000000000000005.i 1.7000000000000006.i 1.8000000000000007.i 1.9000000000000008...instead of what i need which is 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc. ..can someone please point out the root of my idiocy?"
