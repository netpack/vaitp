"two conditions in if statement in blank does not appear to work correctly i am unable to get a multiple if statement to work properly...this is an extract of code from tileboard for homeassistant...here's what i have:..   title: function (item, entity) {.       var start = entity.attributes.next_activity_start;.       var hold_state = entity.attributes.hold_state;.       var hold_until = entity.attributes.hold_until;.       if ( hold_state == ""on"" &amp;&amp; hold_until == ""null"" ); { return 'n/a - hold'; } return timeago(start);.   }, ...hold_state gets populated with ""on"" and hold_until gets populated with ""null"" which is exactly what i am expecting in this code. but, then the if clause seems to only really work properly by looking at the first condition, and not properly taking into account the second condition (hold_until == ""null""). am i using an incorrect syntax in this if statement? i'm wanting it to return ""n/a - hold"" if hold_state is on and hold_until is null."
