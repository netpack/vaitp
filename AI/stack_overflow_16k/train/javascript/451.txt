"blank - iterate over string and drop words from the end say i have a string user.schedule.template.edit and i want to iterate backwards through the string, separated by the . and so get the following results:..user.schedule.template.edit.user.schedule.template.user.schedule.user...what's the best way to do it? is there a specific function for this, or should i just .split() and merge the strings?"
