"prototype based function in blank i just interviewed at a company where they asked me to implement something like  xyz.odd()...it should be like this:..let arr=[1,2,1,2];.arr=arr.odd();// this array will contain all odd numbers [1,1]...i tried, but ended up writing a function where i passed the array but that was not expected.i was not asked to pass any values or array in function."
