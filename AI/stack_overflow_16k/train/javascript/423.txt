"how does operator < or > work when comparing two strings? i used &lt; to compare two strings like this:..console.log('ca'&lt;'bb'); //false...i already know that it compares unicode number of the character.because c is not less than b...however when i do this:..console.log('ba'&lt;'bb');//true...makes me confused, as b is not less than b itself, seems it just skipped it and compared the next character...anyway, i wonder what's the rule here when &lt; or &gt; is used to compare two strings, and for some complicated situations what if when the two strings have different lengths?"
