"access parent element within href so... this is a simple question with a simple answer, but somehow my rtfming isn't proving any results...i have a link within a div, like so:..&lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=''&gt;close&lt;/a&gt;..i'd like to close that div with that link, and i've been trying the following code:..&lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=""blank:this.parentnode.style.display='none'""&gt;close&lt;/a&gt;..however, it still hasn't worked... any suggestions are greatly appreciated."
