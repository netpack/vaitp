blank: real resizing for images i wrote a module where you can perform image manipulation. .there is also always a preview of different filters and so on...the prolbem is that it should all pictures fast. there also can .be a picture with like 3000 x 3000 pixels. for the previews that.would take too much time. ..is there a way to resize the pictures to for example 200 x 200?.i mean a real resizing of the image.
