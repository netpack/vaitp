"blank if statement and && operator not working when using twice same variable in the following code, it looks if the time is below 8:30 am. it's working fine (tested when time was 2:26 am):..function workingschedule() {.    var h = new date().gethours();.    var m = new date().getminutes();.    if (h &lt; 8 &amp;&amp; m &lt; 30) {.        window.alert(""sorry, we're not working at these hours."");.    }.}...however, if i want the code to check if 1) it's earlier than 8:30am; 2) it's later than 12:00 midday, it won't work...function workingschedule() {.    var h = new date().gethours();.    var m = new date().getminutes();.    if ((h &lt; 8 &amp;&amp; m &lt; 30) &amp;&amp; h &gt; 12) {.        window.alert(""sorry, we're not working at these hours."");.    }.}...basically, i have a working schedule from 8:30 am to 12:00, and from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm. i want to display the alert window text ""sorry, we're not working at these hours"" whenever the time of the machine (computer, laptop, cellphone) is not between these hours...is it a problem with &amp;&amp; operators, or with if statement, or both?"
