"playing a sound file has side effects i added this to a condition on my site:..$(""body"").append('&lt;embed src=""sound.wav"" autostart=""true"" hidden=""true""&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;');...and it worked, but the page stopped accepting input after the sound played..this is for an in-house application, so i can specify which browser and version the person has to use...q: why did the page stop accepting input into the text input field?"
