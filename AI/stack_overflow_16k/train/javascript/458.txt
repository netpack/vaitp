"how to get property values from same object in blank? if i have this in blank..var x = {.    ""a"" : function(q) { return q+1; },.    ""b"" : function(w) { return (this[""a""])(1); } .};...i want to do something, like access functions from the same object but different properties..for example, in the above code, property a should be fine, but in property b, i want to use the function stored in a. currently for fun i just have this[""a""] which probably doesn't work. but is there a way i can get that function?..thanks"
