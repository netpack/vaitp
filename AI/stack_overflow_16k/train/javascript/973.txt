"can i remove spaces from a property name inside a reduce function? i came up with the following way to reduce my data:..data = [{ id: 99991, name: ""nodata1"", title: ""no data"" },.        { id: 99992, name: ""nodata2"", title: ""no data"" },.        { id: 99993, name: ""nodata3"", title: ""no data"" }];...var datamapname = data.reduce((rv, v) =&gt; {.    rv[v.name] = v;.    return rv;.}, {}) : null...now if i want to access the id i can enter the following:..var nodata1id = datamapname['nodata1'].id...or  ..var nodata1id = datamapname.nodata1.id...however some of my data has spaces in the name such as:..data = [{ id: 99991, name: ""nodata1"", title: ""no data"" },.        { id: 99992, name: ""nodata2"", title: ""no data"" },.        { id: 99993, name: ""nodata3"", title: ""no data"" },.        { id: 99994, name: ""nodata 4"", title: ""no data"" },.];...is there a way that i could change my function so that it first removed spaces from the name during the reduction so that i could still enter:..var nodata4id = datamapname.nodata4.id"
