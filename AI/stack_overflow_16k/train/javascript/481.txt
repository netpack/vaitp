"catch cannot read property of null in my application i have a code like this :..""docdecespere"": $scope.orphanfatherdocumentupload == null ?.    (.      res.candidaturesituationsociale != ""undefined"" ?.      res.candidaturesituationsociale.docdecespere :.      null.    ) :.    $scope.orphanfatherdocumentupload.name...in some scenarios res.candidaturesituationsociale my be undefined so as you can see i have tested it so if its not undefined i'll affect res.candidaturesituationsociale.docdecespere to ""docdecespere"", but i'm always getting this error :..cannot read property 'docdecespere' of null...so why i'm getting this even though i had a test on it, and how can i solve it ?"
