"cleaner way to call change event function in blank i have a working function that's embedded in select tag like so...&lt;select onchange=""myfunc()"" id=""some_id""&gt;...obviously, when the drop-down option changes, myfunc() will run and pickup the updated option value...but since i don't want to mix blank and html, so is there a much cleaner way to do this rather than embedding the function in the select tag?..i understand adding an event listener might be the option but i don't really know how to make it work to accomplish the same task...i tried using the code below but so far no luck. the value does not change...addeventlistener(""change"", myfunc, false);"
