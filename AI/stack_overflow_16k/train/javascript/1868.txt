"illustrator scripting i am writing a script for an active doc in illustrator. the active doc already has the spot swatch for ""lead"" in it. all the paths i have to set and symbols need to be set to this swatch. i have worked my way around it by deleting the swatch then re-adding it to the doc. this works for all my paths and objects created. there are 3 symbols in the active doc that are being placed by scrip, that are already set to the spot swatch. when my script deletes the swatch it resets the symbol to 100% black process. is there a way to pull the swatch from the active doc?all path items reqiure the leadspotcolor variable to set that color. the lead swatch already exist in the active doc. if i do not add the swatch remove line before hand it errors out, but the swatch remove line sets my symbols already in the active doc to 100% process black, and they also need to be set to the lead swatch...if ( app.documents.length = ""lead"" ) {..   swatchtodelete = app.activedocument.swatches[""lead""];.   swatchtodelete.remove();.   }..var leadspot = doc.spots.add();.var leadspotcolor = new cmykcolor(); .leadspotcolor.cyan = 0;.leadspotcolor.magenta = 0;.leadspotcolor.yellow = 0;.leadspotcolor.black = 100;.leadspot.name = ""lead"";.leadspot.colortype = colormodel.spot;.leadspot.color = leadspotcolor;.var leadspotcolor = new spotcolor();.leadspotcolor.spot = leadspot;"
