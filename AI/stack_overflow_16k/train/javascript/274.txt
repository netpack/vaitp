"inherit the prototype having the parent class:..function animal() {.  // do something.}..animal.prototype.walk = function() {.  alert('i am walking.');.};...and the child class:..function lion() {.  // do something.}...if i want the lion to inherit animal's prototype a common practice is this:..lion.prototype = new animal();..// set the constructor to lion, because now it points to animal.lion.prototype.constructor = lion;...is this in any way different from this (as result not as performance)?..$.extend(lion.prototype, animal.prototype);...for non jquery developers: $.extend copies all the prototype methods and attributes, one by one from animal to lion...i am not a big expert of inheritance in blank. i usually use an mvc framework for front-end development where everything just works, but now i would love to understand also how inheriting the prototype works...note!.i read many articles about the subject, i know there are many ""plugins"" that implements the class functionality. this is not what i need. please answer the question, not just link articles about the subject (except if that answers it)...thank you!"
