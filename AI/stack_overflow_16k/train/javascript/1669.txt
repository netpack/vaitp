"change a value in an object in a function so in my code i have an object:..function myobject(value1, value2, value3){.    this.value1 = value1;.    this.value2 = value2;.    this.value3 = value3;.}...then i have a function:..function myfunction(value1, value2, value3) {.    value1 += value2;.    value3 += 1;.};...how could i use something like this to change the value of the object. for example:..var object1 = new myobject(1,2,3);...so eventually, value1 would become 3, and value3 would become 4. thank you in advance, i'm new to oop"
