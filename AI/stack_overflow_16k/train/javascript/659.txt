"blank object, call on page i have one blank file that houses all the functions for my website, stored it a large object, like this:..var example = {..init : function(){.    alert('init');.},..page_one : function(){.    alert('this is page 1');.},..page_two : function(){.    alert('this is page 2');.}...}..now i like to open a simple script tag on the different pages, and on page1 do example.page_one(); and on page2 do example.page_two();..but this doesn't work. when i call those in the same file as where die example object is made, then it works, but not if i include that file in a page, and call it from there. ..the example object does show up in the window object..can someone help me?"
