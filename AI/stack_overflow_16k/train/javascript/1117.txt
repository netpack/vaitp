"blank: how to group two-dimensional array based matching fields on two input arrays? i have the following arrays a and b as shownï¼š....var a = [.  {id: 1, name: ""phone""},.  {id: 2,  name: ""nick""}.];..var b = [.  {id: 7, parentid: 1, name: ""phone_item1""},.  {id: 8, parentid: 2, name: ""phone_item2""},.  {id: 9, parentid: 1, name: ""nick_item1""},.  {id: 10, parentid: 2, name: ""nick_item2""}.];..//you want to filter by a array id.const filterids = a.map(({ id }) =&gt; id);..//my attempt.const c = object.values(b.reduce((r, c) =&gt; {.  r[c.parentid] = r[c.parentid] || [];.  r[c.parentid].push(c);.  return r;.}, {}));..console.log(c).....i am trying to obtain the following two-dimensional array:..[[.  {id: 7, parentid: 1, name: ""phone_item1""},.  {id: 9, parentid: 1, name: ""nick_item1""}.],[.  {id: 8, parentid: 2, name: ""phone_item2""},.  {id: 10, parentid: 2, name: ""nick_item2""}.]]...the resulting array should be according to the comparison between the id of array a and parentid of array b, so that this style of 2d array results. for some reason my attempt is not working - can you help me?"
