"get ""null"" when the field is empty i'm trying to submit a form and get the data stocked in it. so, in blank, i have something like :..$("".form_itk"").submit(function(event){..    var formdata = $(this).serializearray();.    //...other variables..    $.post(""/kohana-v3.3.5/ajax/nouvel_itk"",{itk : formdata, id_culture : id_culture, id_sol : id_sol, id_region : id_region}.        ).done(function(data){.            console.log(data);.        }).}...then, the variable formdata is sent with ajax to make an insert request. the problem is that i can have empty fields in my form but in that case, i want to get a ""null"" value. currently, i get nothing, even if the field doesn't exist. how can i force the value to be ""null"" ? or is there an other way to get the data of a form in blank ?..thanks in advance !..edit :..let's say i have a simple form in html :...  name : foo.  .  age : 25.  .  sex : woman.  .  hobbie : (empty)...i want to add these data into a database...so i run my blank code to get the values of this form and after the serializearray(), i get something like :...  0 : object : foo.  .  1 : object : 25.  .  2 : object : woman...and that's it ! the ""hobbie"" field doesn't exist in this array...after that, when i try to do a database request : ..insert into 'human' set('name','age','sex','hobbies') values('foo','25','woman')..this request can't work, that's why i want to have a ""null"" instead of nothing."
