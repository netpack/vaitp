"blank split string by specific character string i have a text box with a bunch of comments, all separated by a specific character string as a means of splitting them to display each comment individually...the string in question is | but i can change this to accommodate whatever will work. my only requirement is that it is not likely to be a string of characters someone will type in an everyday sentence...i believe i need to use the split method and possibly some regex but all the other questions i've seen only seem to mention splitting by one character or a number of different characters, not a specific set of characters in a row. ..can anyone point me in the right direction?"
