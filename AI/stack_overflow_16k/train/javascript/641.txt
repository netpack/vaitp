"call, bind, apply vs passing the reference object as an argument using call and bind is important when setting the value of this to the intended object. but what is the significance of using this instead of just passing the object as an argument to the function?..the question occured to me after seeing that .bind is not supported in ie9 and below, so i started passing the object as a parameter to the function i am calling. (i know i could use a shim for bind but that is not the question. the question is about the rationale behind using this.) ..what is the purpose of the this, call, apply, bind syntax in blank and what was it a solution to? wouldn't it be simpler to pass the object as a parameter both for cross-browser support and simplicity (since this is commonly misunderstood or forgotton to be set correctly in code)?"
