"process ascii codes present in string ok. this may be a dumb question but i am stuck...in my blank, i have a string variable that contains &amp;#x27; which stands for single quote. e.g. some_text_&amp;#x27;_some_text.now, i want to replace this with the actual single quote like some_text_'_some_text...obvious way would be using str.replace(/&amp;#x27;/g,""'"") but the problem is i write this blank code into a third party software that replaces &amp;#x27; by ' when i save the script. so, if i open script again, it shows str.replace(/'/g,""'""). so when the script runs, it does not do replace operation correctly...one would ask why do i need this replace to work?.the reason is that this variable is passed on to build a sql query and i don't want &amp;#x27; in my query. i want it to be ' instead which i can escape in sql...edit.so, i realized the reason for this behavior and potential answerers may want to take this into account. the software i work with stores all its files as xml including blank code i write. so, it converts all special characters to html codes while saving and parses them back when it reads it. that's the reason &amp;#x27; gets converted to '."
