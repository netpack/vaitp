"blank input type=file is there any way to define target directory? [edit] i'm working on a web ui with the following attributes:...the web server runs locally on the user's machine.the location of the csv files in question are static, and never change.the ui uses blank to communicate with a java rest controller, which then handles the heavy lifting for the file reading/editing/writing...in the ui itself the user selects a csv file, then that file gets loaded into the ui for viewing, editing, etc. i wanted to pass the path to a rest controller, then have the receiving java application read the file, etc. but it appears you can't get the path using input type file for security reasons. for my purposes though this would work just as well if i can limit the directory access since the files will always be local and always be located in the same place. basically, the user can select csv files from one of several directories:...../csvtype1/*.csv...../csvtype2/*.csv...../csvtype3/*.csv..so if the current type being edited is csvtype1 i'm trying to prevent the user from accessing the other directories in order to prevent them from trying to load the wrong type. if the path could be accessed i could do a quick check and throw up an alert if they're in the wrong directory, but limiting access would work fine too. right now i've got it so that it only accepts csv files:..&lt;input type=""file"" accept="".csv"" ng-model=""csvfileinfo.selectedfilename"" id=""csvfile"" style=""display:none"" /&gt;...but is there a way to say 'only accept csv files within this directory and its subdirectories'?"
