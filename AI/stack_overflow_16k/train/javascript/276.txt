"how to make your script easy to keep track with? i know this question is going to be...weird and...odd. i have programmed stuffs for around 4 years until now, since i was 14. i found out that i have changed my ways of writing script quite many times and i don't know which way is better, is there any standard for writing and displaying a script?..ok, this is how i write when i started [i will make an example with long, deep [whatever] so you can see how i display a script]:..$(document).ready(function().{.odd=0; even=0;.for(i=0; i&lt;10; i++).{.for(j=0; j&lt;10; j++).{.if((i+j)%2==0).{.even++;.alert(i+j);.}.else.{.odd++;.alert(i+j);.}.}.}.});...and then, when i started some more complex script, i found out that the way above is completely stupid, so i changed several times the way to write it, and about 2 years ago, i found out a way to write script for myself:..$(document).ready(function().    {.    odd=0; even=0;.    for(i=0; i&lt;10; i++).        {.        for(j=0; j&lt;10; j++).            {.            if((i+j)%2==0).                {.                even++;.                alert(i+j);.                }.            else.                {.                odd++;.                alert(i+j);.                }.            }.        }.    });...well, it looks more clearly right? but recently, i found out that many programmers write script in this way:..$(document).ready(function() {.    odd = 0;.    even = 0;.    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {.        for (j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) {.            if ((i + j) % 2 == 0) {.                even++;.                alert(i + j);.            }.            else {.                odd++;.                alert(i + j);.            }.        }.    }.});...and i am confused now. i want to have myself a way that will last forever. so i am asking if there is any standard of how to display your script so that it will be easy to keep track of for everyone else?..thanks for any idea. :p.[x]"
