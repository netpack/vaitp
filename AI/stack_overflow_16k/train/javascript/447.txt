"blank nested function ""not a function"" so, i have a blank file i'm including in my page. here's the gist of it:..var pagetransitions = (function() {..    function setcurrent(currentset) {.        alert(currentset);.    }..    function nextpage(options, direction, gotopage) {.        //some working code, not important.    }..})();...on the page, i'm using:..pagetransitions.nextpage(x, x, x);...that works fine. however, trying to use..pagetransitions.setcurrent(x);...gives me pagetransitions.setcurrent is not a function..not sure why this is happening, pretty sure the syntax is correct. unfortunately it's something for work, not allowed to share the actual page where it's occurring. had our senior dev take a look, but they said it looked like it should be working. any thoughts on why this would be happening?..i'm calling setcurrent after the blank file gets called, also tried moving it after nextpage to be sure. nextpage still worked, setcurrent still not a function...also tried renaming setcurrent, and the variable it's being passed. still no good."
