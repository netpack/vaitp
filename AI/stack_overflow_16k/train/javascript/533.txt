"dynamically and efficiently assigning today's date as string to property as the title says i want to dynamically assign today's date as string in ""dd/mm/yyyy"" format to the property. it has to be dynamically calculated and assigned right next to the objects property declaration...i figured something like this:..var obj = {.    today: `${(new date).getdate()}/${(new date).getmonth()}/${(new date).getfullyear()}`.};...which works perfect but it's obviously not efficient as it creates three new date instances..i would like to do it something like this: ..var obj = {.    today: (.        const today = new date;.        return `${today.getdate()}/${today.getmonth()}/${today.getfullyear()}`.    ).};...thanks!"
