"blank window.print() defaults to pdf a print button on a site i am working on opens a new window and populates it with some html. i call window.print() which works fine, but the default printer for myself and others who have tested it is always a pdf writer if one is available on the system. is there a way to open the print dialog box with the appropriate default printer selected so that the user does not have to select their printer every time?"
