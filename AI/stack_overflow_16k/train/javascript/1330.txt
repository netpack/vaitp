"clean way to populate content of element i need to append content (html) to an element. this is how i am currently doing it.....element.innerhtml += ""&lt;a href="""" + something[awesome] + """"&gt;"" + something[great] + ""&lt;/a&gt;"";.element.innerhtml += ""&lt;br&gt;"";...this seems very messy. are there any cleaner ways of doing this? is the createelement() method the correct way of achieving this?"
