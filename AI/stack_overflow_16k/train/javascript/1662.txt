"why var variable in blank become global when used in for loop? i have been told the variable defined by var in blank will be local...for example:..function myfunc(){var v=100; return v;}...if you access the v outside the function you will hit ..uncaught referenceerror: v is not defined...but then i found when using in for loop, the variable defined by var become global. for example..for(var i=0;i&lt;10;i++){/*do nothing*/}...after the for loop you can still access the variable i. why it becomes global? what is the difference when using in function and for loop?"
