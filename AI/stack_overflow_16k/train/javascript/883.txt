"recover reference to browser window once lost? my software allows users to chat in a new browser window:..chatwindow = window.open(url, ""chatwindow"");...i can store a reference to this window in a collection and use it as needed. the main thing i do with this reference is checking to prevent more than one chat window from being opened at a time...my question is that once the chatwindow is open, the user can navigate the original browser window to, say, www.google.com. in this case, the chatwindow is still open and chatting fine. my issue is that the user can then return to my application and open another chatwindow, since i have lost my original reference to it. is there a way to regain this reference once it has been lost? perhaps referencing the window by name?..thanks for your help."
