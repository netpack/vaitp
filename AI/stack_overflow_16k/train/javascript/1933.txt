"difference between '()' or '(othermodule)' before module close and after module close in blank i'm new in blank modules. i read many articles for that, and find modules are defined by two different ways below:..// '()' after module close.var firstmodule = (function() {.  // module defination goes here.})();..// '()' before module close.var secondmodule = (function() {.  // module definition goes here.}());...i try both and not find any difference...please reply what is the difference between both, and in which case we've to use which type of declaration?"
