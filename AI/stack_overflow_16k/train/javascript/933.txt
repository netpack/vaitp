"simple issues with setinterval so sorry for a basic qn like this. this is my simple js code to do a timer. i was hoping to print the countdown number periodically. i tested the rest of the code and it seems to work, however it gives me sth weird when i add the setinterval command. i am not sure why. i hence seek an explanation and how to correct it..also, when it works, the new reloaded number should replace the old number right. for instance when 4 appears, it simply replaces 5 during the countdown. ..code:..var x = prompt(""time till take off"");....function printtimer (){.  document.write(x).}..while (x &gt; 0) {..  setinterval(printtimer,1000).  x = x -1;.}..if (x=1){.  document.write(""rocket taken off"")}...thanks!"
