"js - fire event on midnight i am making a simple web app using blank. at one part i want an event to fire when the date changes (i.e., 4th jan becomes 5th jan)...this is what i am doing:..window.onload=function(){.var today = new date();.var tommorow = new date(today.getfullyear(),today.getmonth(),today.getdate()+1);.var timetomidnight = (tommorow-today)/60;.var timer = settimeout(function(){console.log(""this"");},timetomidnight);.}...anyhow, the problem i am facing is that the function is getting executed around 30-40 seconds before it is actually midnight. what's wrong? what should i do?"
