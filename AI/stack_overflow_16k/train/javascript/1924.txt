"blank alert number starting with 0 i have a button where in the code behind i add a onclick and i pass a unique id which will be passed to the js function. the id starts with a 0. ..it wasn't working and eventually i figured out that the number, id, it was passing was wrong.....ie. see this: js fiddle..it works with a ' at the start and end of the number. just wondering why 013 turns to 11. i did some googling and couldn't find anything... ..cheers..robin..edit:..thanks guys. yep understand now. ..as in this case the 0 at the start has a meaning, here the recipient id in a mailing list, i will use '013' instead of just 013, i.e. a string. i can then split the values in js as each of the 3 values represents a different id which will always be only 1 character long, i.e. 0-9."
