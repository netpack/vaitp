"can we define a ""function declaration"" also as a ""function statement""? this question born considering the function declarations vs function expressions...we clearly know that a function declaration have this form..function foo() { .    var a = 3;.    console.log( a );.}...while a function expression can have this form (appearing like what is known like immediately invoked function expression)..(function foo() { .    var a = 3;.    console.log( a );.})()...looking at the immediately invoked function expression i can just notice the first function (the one used in the function declaration) wrapped in parethesis...now, the point is: i know that the grouping operator (most commonly known as ""the parethesis"" () ) can only contain an expression. if this is true i can't say that the function declaration is also a function statement (because it would be like saying that i have wrapped in parenthesis a statement...)...so, can you give some help, i'm a little confused..a function declaration is also a function statement? if yes, the function wrapped in parenthesis is a statement or what?..i must clarify that i'm not asking about the difference beetwen a function declaration and a function expression. if i mention them and their differences is just to describe my question that is: a ""function declaration"" is also a ""function statement""?"
