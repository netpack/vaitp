"why does console.log return undefined after correct output? i'm writing a very simple js function and was wondering if the console returning 'undefined' after correctly logging every function call was normal or an error as a result of a badly written function...const getweather = function(country, weathertype) {.    console.log('the weather in ' + country + ' is ' + weathertype + '.');.}..console.log(getweather('scotland', 'sunny'));.console.log(getweather('japan', 'beautiful'));.console.log(getweather('germany', 'frosty'));"
