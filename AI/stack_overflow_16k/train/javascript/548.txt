"differentiating between arrays and ""hashes"" in blank in order to make the syntax for one of my functions nicer, i need to be able to tell whether a specific parameter is an array or ""hash"" (which i know are just objects)...typeof doesn't work, because they both return the same thing..typeof {foo:""bar""} // object..typeof [""foo"",""bar""] // object..so how would i differentiate between the two?..i know this works, but i'm hoping there's a nicer way..({foo:""bar""}).constructor // object()..([""foo"",""bar""]).constructor // [ undefined ]..edit.ah, it seems [ undefined ] in firebug is the same thing as array. kind of weird."
