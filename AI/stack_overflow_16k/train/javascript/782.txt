"i don't understand why my global variable isn't updating? i posted about this yesterday but i am still dumbfounded. .i can't seem to figure out this problem. i want to update the parkendpoint url with a new value for the statename variable when the user clicks on a state svg. it keeps coming up as the original value in line 1. ..i have tried looking in the console and after the function getstatename runs it does update the statename variable, but when i console log the parkendpoint variable after that function has run, it still shows the old variable, which i just set to nothing. ..var statename = """";.const alertendpoint = (""https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/alerts? .&amp;limit=400&amp;api_key="" + apikey );.var parkendpoint = (""https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/parks? .statecode="" + statename + ""&amp;limit=100&amp;api_key="" + apikey);..const elements = document.queryselectorall('path');.console.log(elements);..// add event listeners.elements.foreach(function(el) {.  el.addeventlistener(""click"",  getstatename);..});...   function getstatename(nodelist){.   statename = nodelist.path[0].id;.   outputstatename(statename);.. }..   function outputstatename(statename) {.   console.log(statename);.   console.log(parkendpoint);.  }....i just want it to update the statename variable in the url."
