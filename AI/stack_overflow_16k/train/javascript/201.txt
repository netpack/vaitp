"setting an array key value in blank this code obviously doesn't work in blank, but how do i do this in js?..it should be obvious from the code but i need to assign an array key value (so 'a', '5' and '8' in the example below) - unfortunately i do need to have a letter, so 0, 1, 2 etc. is no good...i've seen something to do with objects and 'a':'op1' but it doesn't seem to work an i'm getting errors such as "" unexpected token : "" - i bet this is easy when you know how?..var options = new array('a' =&gt; 'op1', '5' =&gt; 'op2', '8' =&gt; 'op3');..for(x in options) {..    var value = options[x];..    alert(""the key is "" + value[0]);..    alert(""the value is "" + value[1]);..}...jquery or native js, whichever is best is fine (i'm using jquery on that page anyway)"
