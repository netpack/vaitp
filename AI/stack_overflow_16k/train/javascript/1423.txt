"difference between bind, apply and call method? i was searching in stackoverflow and the web, could not get proper results or explanation siting difference between these three methods. ..as far as i understand, they all do the same executing the function/method in different context. ..var google = {  .    makebeer : function(arg1,arg2){     .         alert([arg1, arg2]);        .    }    .}..google.makebeer('water','soda');...this is my normal function of the google object. now when i make use of call and bind method here, here is the output. ..var google = {.    makebeer: function (arg1, arg2) {.        alert([arg1, arg2]);.    }.}..google.makebeer('water', 'soda');..function yahoo() {}..var yah = new yahoo();.google.makebeer.call(yah, 'pepsi', 'coke');..function msn() {..}..var msn = new msn();.google.makebeer.call(msn, 'sprite', 'limca');...i still don't see a purpose of doing this, i can go-ahead and call the google.makebeer three times with different arguments...can anyone enlighten me more over this."
