"this with addeventlistener hey guys am new to blank..and i have been learning the use of this in blank and i found that the value of this keyword depends upon how the function was called..but the code from mdn confuses me ..the code is ....var something = function(element) {..  this.name = 'something good';..    this.onclick1 = function(event) {..    console.log(this.name);..};..  this.onclick2 = function(event) {..  console.log(this.name); .. };..  element.addeventlistener('click', this.onclick2.bind(this), false); ..}...when i call the function with var b = new something(param) it works well ..i know now the value of this will be b..but when i redited the same code with window on the place of this..like window.onclick2.bind(window).it gives the same input .i dont know why they are giving me the same output..whats the actualy value of this here ??..hope you can make me understand ..."
