"quickest way to get .domain.com in blank i try to set a cookies via js using jquery.cookie for all the current subdomains like this..$.cookie('account', 'myvalue', { path: '/', domain: '.domain.com' });...the thing is that window.location.hostname will return www.domain.com or domain.com depending on its context. ..is there any method available to simply replace the subdomain if present to a ""."" and if no subdomain present still show the . at the beginning?"
