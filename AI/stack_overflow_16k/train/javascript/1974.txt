"why does re-declaring an argument inside of a try/catch throw a referenceerror? i mistakenly wrote a re-declaration of an argument as a const in a function and instead of throwing syntaxerror: identifier 'bar' has already been declared i ended up with referenceerror: bar is not defined..  ..what causes this behaviour? it wasn't the expected error, and left me confused for a few minutes. ..example code: ..function foo(bar) {.  try {.      console.log(bar);.      const bar = 123;.  } catch(err) { console.log(err) }.}.foo(456);...if i don't wrap the declaration in a try/catch, i get (what i believe to be) the expected error."
