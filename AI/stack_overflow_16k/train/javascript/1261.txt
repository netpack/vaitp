"range.surroundnode deleting textcontent of parent node i am trying to create a text editor like ckeditor so my first objective is getting a selection and adding tags to the selection. when i select text and click a button it gets the selection and then surrounds it with a paragraph element. it works for the first time but when i try to do it again, it deletes all the elements (so the first paragraph element that was made in this case) and surround the new selection with paragraph element. i tried deleting the current selection then adding the inserting a new paragraph element with the selected text as the innertext...this is my blank...var editable = document.queryselector(""button"");.var newnode = document.createelement(""p"");.newnode.textcontent = ""hey""..editable.addeventlistener(""click"", function (event) {.    var selection = window.getselection();.    var node_sel = selection.getrangeat(0);.    console.log(selection.rangecount);.    node_sel.surroundcontents(newnode).    //node_sel.insertnode(newnode);..})"
