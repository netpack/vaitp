"determining if an array contains an even number i'm new to blank and am trying to get a feel for the language. here's a function i wrote which is supposed to return true if an array contains an even number and false if it does not...var containsevennums = function(numarray) {.    numarray.foreach(function(element) {.        if(element % 2 == 0) {.            return true;.        }.    });.    return false;.};..var main = function() {.    var nums = [1,2,3,4];..    console.log(""this array contains even number(s): "" + containsevennums(nums));.};...i know that this has something to do with ajax and callback functions, but since i'm new to the language, can you explain why exactly my code is returning ""undefined""?"
