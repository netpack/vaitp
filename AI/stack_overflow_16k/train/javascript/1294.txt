"is it possible to define an event listener for every object in an array? i'm getting acquainted with blank by messing around with elevatorsaga. i've gotten to the point where i'm handed an array with four elevator objects. i'd like to define the same event listener for all of them without duplicating a lot of code. i tried to do so this way, but it doesn't seem to work:..{.    init: function(elevators, floors) {.        for(var elevator in elevators).        {.            elevator.on(""idle"", function() {.                elevator.gotofloor(3);.            }).        }      .    },.    update: function(dt, elevators, floors) {.        // we normally don't need to do anything here.    }.}...is there a way to do what i'm trying to do here?"
