"why do i not get a formated date with this blank-script? i am new with blank, so maybe i missed the obvious...i have the following script (see also some other answer):..&lt;script&gt;.var d = new date();.document.getelementbyid(""demo"").innerhtml = d.tolocaleformat(""dd.mm.yyyy"");.&lt;/script&gt;...which i want to use to create a formatted date in jacasvript. if the date is today (26 june 2015) i expect this script to produce the following string: ..26.06.2015...however, what i get is the following: ..dd.mm.yyyy...is the other answer wrong? how can i get this formatted date without some extra library?..i also tried to use parse or format instead without success."
