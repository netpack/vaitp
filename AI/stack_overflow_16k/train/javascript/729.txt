"how can i use string argument input as a variable name in blank? how can i use string argument input as a part of variable name in a blank? i want to do that because it seems to be tedious to define getter and setter for all the fields... while most of the fields have similar names...for example,..var random = {.    this.input1_field : null,.    this.input2_field : null,.    set: function(name,field){.       this.name_field = field;   .    }.}...where i want name_field to be dynamic based on the input variable 'name'. (ex, name=""input1"" or name=""input2"" etc)"
