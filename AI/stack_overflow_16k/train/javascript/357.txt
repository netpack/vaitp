"blank: open links in new tabs i would like to make a blank that would put in each link the attribute target=""_blank"", so that the link would open in a new tab. this is how i did it:..function open_links_in_new_tabs() {.    var links = document.documentelement.getelementsbytagname( ""a"" );.    for(var link in links) {.        link.setattribute(""target"", ""_blank"");.    }.}..window.onload = function() { open_links_in_new_tabs(); }...but, this doesn't work. do you see where the mistake is?..thanks,..ivan"
