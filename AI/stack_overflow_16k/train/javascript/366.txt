blank continuous function i want to write a function that continuously renders the data from a form.  i am creating a form that has a price and sales tax and it outputs total price.  upon editing information i want my function to automatically update the total price without clicking a button.  for example if something cost $10 with a 5% tax the price will be $10.50. if i change the price to $5 on the form i would want the total price to automatically update. i'm looking for some guidance to approaching this.
