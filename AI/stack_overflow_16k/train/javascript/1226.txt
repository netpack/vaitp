"js: why is my variable being assigned a function instead of calling the function? i'm trying to set some random coordinates on a map. i wrote the console.log line to see if it was successfully picking numbers, but it's telling me that everything in my destinations array is nan. ..it looks like it's assigning the math.random function to the variable instead of calling math.random and giving it the number it returns. anyone know what's up?..var nodecount = 10.var mapsize = 100;..var destinations = new array(nodecount);.for (var i = 0; i &lt; nodecount; i++) {.    destinations[i] = new array(2);.}..var generatedestinations = function(nodecount) {.    for (var i=0; i&lt;nodecount; i++) {.        destinations[i][0] = math.floor(math.random*mapsize); //sets x-coord.        destinations[i][1] = math.floor(math.random*mapsize); //sets y-coord.        console.log(destinations);.    }.};.generatedestinations(nodecount);"
