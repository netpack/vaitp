"blank code printing multiple results i'm trying to write some code that will print either ""spinning left"" or ""spinning right"" depending on whether the left or right arrow keys are pressed down. at the moment, it seems to continuously print out the statement until the other key is pressed, and then it will just print the other statement many times instead. heres my code at the moment : ..   function update () {.        if(input.getkey(keycode.leftarrow)){.            print(""spinning left"");.        }.        if(input.getkey(keycode.rightarrow)){.            print(""spinning right"");.        }.    }...i originally had ""left"" instead of keycode.leftarrow, but it didn't change the output. i'm new to blank, so is there something that i forgot to do to make the program stop registering that the button is pushed?"
