"blank: if ""object"" is a function, how it can have methods? if i check the type of the object object it says ""function"":..typeof object === ""function""...but we all know, that object has multiple methods such as:..object.create();.object.freeze();.object.seal();.object.getprototypeof();.......(check https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/blank/reference/global_objects/object)..my question: how is that possible? how a function is able to have methods? i always thought, that a method is a function that is the value of a property of an object...here we use it as an object:..object.freeze();...and here we  use it as a constructor function:..var myobj  = new object();.var myobj2 = object();...what is ""object"" now? it seems it is both: function and object. ..is it a special case because these (object, array, string, number) are the ""native constructors""?"
