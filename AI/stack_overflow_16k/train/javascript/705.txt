"what's the difference between blank timeout and timer methods js support timeout and timer. here is their definition:..timeout - repeat execution of a code within specific time and it returns an integer that can be used to cancel pending timeout...var timeout_id = settimeout(f,500);.clearttimeout(timeout_id);...timer - repeat exectuion of code at specific interval...id = setinterval(f,5000);.clearinterval(id)...i am a little confused, what is their difference?"
