"maximum and minimum difference i have written a function that return the maximum and minimum differences of numbers in n given arrays. it seems to work but i want to eliminate zero as the minimum difference. i also want to be able to concatenate more than two arrays incase input has more than two...function maxandmin(arr1,arr2){.  var maxi =0;.  var mini =0;..  var newarr = arr1.concat(arr2);..  maxi = math.max.apply(null,newarr)-math.min.apply(null,newarr);.. newarr = newarr.sort(function(a, b) {.  return a - b; });..   for (var i=0; i&lt;newarr.length; i++){.      if (newarr[i+1] - newarr[i] &lt; mini).          mini = newarr[i+1] - newarr[i];..   }.   return [maxi, mini];.}"
