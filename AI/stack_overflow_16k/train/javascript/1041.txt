"tick format to decimal format conversion can anybody suggest me how can i convert a given tick format number to decimal sing blank ?..tick format                         decimal.10-8           10+8/32              == 10.25.10-16/32       10+ 16/32            == 10.50.10-8+          10 + 8/32 + 1/64    == 10.265625...the format consists of an integer part, followed by '-' and then a fractional part specified in multiples of 1/32 (called a quote). there can be an optional '+' at the end to indicate a half-quote (1/64). as i am a beginner in js it would be a great a help if anybody can suggest basic idea ( not full length code) to get started...thanks"
