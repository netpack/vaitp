"blank foo = foo.bar = foobar i'm pretty confused by something i encountered in an application i'm working in...there is a method in my object, called move which does this (simplified) upon clicking a list item...var board = {.  move: function() {.     var unique_id = puzzle.pieces.id = 28;.     // more stuff going on with the unique_id variable..  },.}...then throughout the application, puzzle.pieces.id gets used to assign ids to other stuff like this:..$('#puzzle-piece-' + puzzle.pieces.id + '');...after thinking about it might be doing for a while, i came with the following:.upon invoking the method, unique_id assigns a temporary property to the pieces object in the puzzle namespace object. then when clicking a new list item, the the property get overwritten with a new value. ..if this is correct, is it a common practise to quickly make a temporary value available throughout an application, if not, what does it really do?"
