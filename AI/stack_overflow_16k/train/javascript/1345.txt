"blank - how does if statement realize what you enter? my if statement:..if (type = ""connect"") {.    window.open('games.html');.}...hello everyone, i am really new to blank, and i can't find that information anywhere. at the top is my if statement for example. i want it to open for me a games tab when i type and press enter the phrase ""connect"". but it works for everything that i typed. english isnâ€™t my first language, so please excuse my mistakes. thanks you."
