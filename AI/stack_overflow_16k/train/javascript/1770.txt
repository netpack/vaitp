"swapping object variables in blank without using a 3rd variable there is a well known method to swap 2 numeric variables without using a 3rd variable with simple arithmetic operations...a = 3;.b = 5;.b += a;.a = b - a;.b -= a;.console.log(a); //5.console.log(b); //3...no mystery here. but i need to swap two variables that are objects and i have no idea how to tackle this...the objects are very complex with properties of different data types and methods. here is an example for simplification:..a = {.  label: ""xxxxxxx"",.  active: false,.  dothatthang: function(val) {.    //some code.  }.};...i'm currently using a 3rd variable to perform the swap but the objects are really big and it's messing with the animation where the variables are swapping values."
