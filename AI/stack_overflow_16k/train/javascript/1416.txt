"how can i make all my blank libraries load? i have couple .js files i'm importing into a larger project. i've found that the project can't actually access them, and, as a result, i tried boiling it down to its most basic code to test. essentially, i have one html file that loads the .js files using ..    &lt;script src=""files/data.js"" type=""text/blank""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.    &lt;script src=""files/tally.js"" type=""text/blank""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;...data.js looks like this:..var data= {};.data.values=[];.data.values[""philadelphia""]=10;.data.values[""level""]=109;..    data.getvalue=function(level){...}//returns 109..    data.checkvalues=function(level){...}//returns true...tally looks like this:..var enemytally= {};.    enemytally.cities=[];.    enemytally.cities[""philadelphia""]=12;.    enemytally.cities[""boston""]=0;.    enemytally.cities[""new york""]=0;..    enemytally.gettally=new function(level){...}//should return 12..    enemytally.add=new function(level){...}...when i attempt to run some of this using code like this:..    var level=""philadelphia"";.    var val=data.getvalue(level);.    //var val2=enemytally.gettally(level);.    document.writeln(data.checkvalues(""level""));.    document.writeln(data.getvalue(""level""));.    document.writeln(enemytally.gettally(level));...my page reads true 109 instead of true 109 12. i don't know why it isn't loading the other file. i know it's not an error with gettally(), as it's identical to data.getvalue. the only reason i have tally is because i copied it from my more complicated project to see if it would work here. i'm not terribly familiar with blank at all - i'm coming from java for a project with a friend - and this is stumping me. i noticed that if i reinstate the commented out var declaration, the whole thing doesn't work- nothing writes...i've done some reading, and it's led me to think that it could be an issue with the whole asynchronous loading thing, but reloading the page or browser doesn't fix it. it does the same thing in both firefox and chrome. i can code my functions to do what i want, and the general structure of the files seems to be right for what i'm doing, but they won't load and it's driving me nuts. any simple js help would be appreciated. thanks!..edit: i edited the code to show my problem, and the solution (turns out in not copying my code into so i actually fixed the problem, which made it tough for you guys to fix.) i had ""new"" before my functions in enemytally. whoops. thanks to those who did help, though."
