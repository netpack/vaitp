blank replace values if subtracting vs. adding i am trying to optimize some code which will subtract or add values.  i'd like consolidate the following so that if the variable reduce = t then we use '-'and 'subtract' and if reduce = f then we use '+' and 'add'.  as you might notice we are using numeral.js and 'subtract' is its native subtract function...any suggestions would be great...totalqty = numeral(licfldvalue-(qty*liqty)).format('0');.totalqty = numeral(licfldvalue+(qty*liqty)).format('0');..var updnewused = numeral(newcalused).subtract(newdiff).format('0');.var updnewused = numeral(newcalused).add(newdiff).format('0');
