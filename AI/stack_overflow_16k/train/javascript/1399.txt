"syntax for setting a variable in blank (edit: i found this syntax while reading someone else's code) ..is there any good reason for using the following syntax for setting a variable in blank:..this.index &gt;= this.items.length &amp;&amp; (this.index = 0);...is it just to get the expression on one line of code, or is there another, dare i say better, reason for this way of doing it.....edit: the code is equivalent to:..if (this.index &gt;= this.items.length) { .    this.index = 0; .}"
