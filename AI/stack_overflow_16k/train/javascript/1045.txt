"should i put the version number of my blank library in the file name? i am about to release a blank library...i would like to save the file as [library-name].1.0.0 ..then as the library will evolve you will be able to download new versions, e.g....[library-name].1.0.1.js.[library-name].1.0.2.js.[library-name].1.0.3.js  .[library-name].1.1.0.js  .[library-name].1.2.0.js.[library-name].2.0.0.js...my question is: is there any reason not to save the version in the name of the file?..i am using other 3rd party libraries and the ones for which i don't store the version i always have to figure out if i have to upgrade or not...for instance, i use codemirror.js, and i always wonder if i am using the latest version."
