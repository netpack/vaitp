"instant messenger communicate using http rather than tcp/websocket i notice an instant messenger using blank/http/xmlhttprequest rather than tcp/websocket to communicate...such as http://w.qq.com/login.html..i monitored its communication way in chrome developer tool..all are http requests. one request to server every minute...the thing i confused is that if i send a message to the http client, it receives the message immediately...as i know http client can not get message from others, it has to send request and get response...is there any way to make http client to get message from others without using tcp/socket or sending request and geting response?..your comment welcome"
