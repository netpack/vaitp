"losing global value in function wonder if anyone can help...bascially in blank i am trying to grab the image sizes of an image before it has loaded to the page, so i can resize some thumbnails on the fly in a gallery...the path in works fine, the preloader works fine, and i can see the width &amp; height is being grabbed in the getwidthandheight function...my problem is, i'm trying to assign this to a global variable to use in other functions, but the global variable is lost outside of the getwidthandheight function. (i declared the global var at the start of the file eg var gwidth)..i have notcied thought however it all works when i stuck the alert(gwidth) in there ! obvioulsy i don't the alert box firing off - any ideas why this only works when the alert is in there, and why the global could be losing its value when the alert is disabled ?..thanks..function getwidthandheight() {.    gwidth = this.width;.    alert(gwidth);.    gheight = this.height;  .    return true;.}.function loadfailure() {.    alert(""'"" + this.name + ""' failed to load."");.    return true;.}.....function getimgsize(gim_imgsrc).{..var myimage = new image();..myimage.name = gim_imgsrc;.myimage.onload = getwidthandheight;.myimage.onerror = loadfailure;.myimage.src = gim_imgsrc;..getwidthandheight(myimage);.alert(""width is"" + gwidth);.alert(testglobal);..return gwidth;..}"
