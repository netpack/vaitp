"blank and query i am new to blank and trying to add a and query to a js file..i have added a checkbox this is required to be checked for the submit button to show..in the original there was already one checkbox with the js query but i have added a second. how do i make the js only allow the button to be clicked when both are checked?..the current code for the js is..jquery('.check_policy').on('click', function(){.        if(jquery('#policycheck') .is(':checked')){.            jquery(""#listingsubmitbtn"").prop('disabled',false);.            jquery(""#listingsubmitbtn"").removeclass('dissablebutton');.        }.        else{.            jquery(""#listingsubmitbtn"").prop('disabled',true);.            jquery(""#listingsubmitbtn"").addclass('dissablebutton');.        }.    });...the second check box i have added is called policycheck_2..thanks in advance for any help. i think this could be one of many js questions..mark"
