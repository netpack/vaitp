"how do i create a formula in which a compounded numeric variable equals a specified value? if you clicked on this post, i know the question is a little bit unclear. so i have to show you what i mean instead...var value = 30;.var num = 1;.var total = 0;..while(num &lt; 10){..total +=num;.num++;..}.if(total == value){.console.log(""they are equivalent"");.}...alright consider the variables value, num, and total. while num is less than 10, the specified value. i want it to add  the num value into total, but at the end of the loop i want total and value to be equivalent. i just don't know how to do that or what formula i need to create in order to do that."
