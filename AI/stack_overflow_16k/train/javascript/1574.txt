"trying to make a function that takes in variable names as strings new to js, sorry if this is an obvious one...i have some strings in my code that correspond to the names of variables. i'd like to put them into a function and have the function be able to make changes to the variables that have the same names as the strings. ..the best example is where this 'string' is passed through from a data tag in html, but i have some other situations where this issue appears. open to changing my entire approach too is the premise of my question is backwards...&lt;html&gt;.&lt;div  data-location=""deck"" onclick=""movecards(this.data-location);""&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;...var deck = [""card""];.function movecards(location){.location.shift();};....thanks!"
