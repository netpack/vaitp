"creating portfolio descriptions with max number of words i am showing off projects on a website and each image has a description. i want to cut off the description with an ellipses after 50 or so characters. i also don't want the last word to be be partially cut off. ..example: ..decription: ""this building was designed in 1970 on the corner of 11th and 15th street.""..description on website: ""this building was designed in 1970...""..the blank is external and the descriptions are under the class name ""card-text"". this is what i have so far, but it doesn't seem to be working:..var string = document.getelementbyclassname('card-text');.function truncate(string){. if (string.length &gt; 20).  return string.substring(0,20)+'...';. else.  return string;.};"
