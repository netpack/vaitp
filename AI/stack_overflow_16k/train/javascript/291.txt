"why is tab equal to false in blank? i thought i knew about the quirks with == and all the strange type casts in blank, but today i stumbled upon one thing that doesn't make any sense to me:..'t' == false.// =&gt; true...why is that?..apparently, 't' is not a falsy value, and if combined with || it works as excpected:..'t' ||Â 42.// =&gt; 't'...on the other hand, a tostring is also not called on false, see:..'t' == 'false'.// =&gt; false...this led me to thinking that the tab maybe gets converted to a boolean, but:..boolean('t') == false.// =&gt; false...so, the question is: why is that?"
