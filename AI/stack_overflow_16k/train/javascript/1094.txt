"blank scrollintoview smooth scroll and offset i have this code for my website..function clickme() {.   var element = document.getelementbyid('about');.   element.scrollintoview({.       block: ""start"",.       behavior: ""smooth"",.   });.}...this works pretty nice but i have a fixed header so when the code scrolls to the element the header is in the way...is there a way to have an offset and make it scroll smoothly?"
