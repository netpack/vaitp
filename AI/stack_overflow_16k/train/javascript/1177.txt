"casting null or falsy values to undefined i would like to turn any falsy value to undefined so that a particular property won't be added to the resulting json object...const response = {.  myvalue: 'somestring',.  errormessage: error &amp;&amp; 'an unexpected error occurred'.};...here, i would like the errormessage property to resolve to undefined when the error object is null. unfortunately, when there's no error, the errormessage property becomes null instead of undefined, resulting in it being included in the final object. is there syntax available to prevent this?"
