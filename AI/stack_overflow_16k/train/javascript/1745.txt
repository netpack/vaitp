"unable to change binding after hard binding function using 'bind' i just came up with the following snippet while trying to understand binding functions. ....var obj = {.  a: function test() {.    console.log(this.b);.  }.bind(window),.  b: 'b object value'.};..window.b = 'b window value';.....now, if i execute the following: ....var fn = obj.a.bind(obj);..fn(); // prints 'b window value'.....even after hard binding again to obj, b window value is printed. how can i modify the above code so that obj.a function prints b object value?..i am hoping to achieve this without modifying the first block of code."
