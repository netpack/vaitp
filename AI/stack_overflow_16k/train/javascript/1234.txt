"how to add non-breaking space to a string in blank? i want to display an array of strings in html with a random number of white spaces  in front of the string in the array. how would i go about doing this in blank? i first did a loop of the array and tried adding  ""   "" to each string in the array, but the white spaces don't show up. i also tried adding  &amp;nbsp but it doesn't get interpreted in blank."
