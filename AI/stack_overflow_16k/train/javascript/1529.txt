"unexpected output in blank i am beginner to blank and i am getting unexpected output..here is the code..&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;..        function add(a,b).        {.            x = a+b;.            return x;.        }.        var num1 = prompt(""what is your no."");.        var num2 = prompt(""what is another no."")..        alert(add(num1,num2));...    &lt;/script&gt;...it should give output as a sum of two number entered by us on prompting but it is simply concatenating the two number and popping the output"
