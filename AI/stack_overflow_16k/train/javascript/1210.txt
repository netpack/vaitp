"blank not executing right after body position is set to fixed in safari i have a target html element that has display property set to none...i want to display this target html element when the user clicks a trigger html element...i want to do this with vanilla blank...while the target element is open, i don't want the user to be able to scroll the body, so before displaying the target element i set the body overflow to hidden and to prevent mobile browsers from bouncing around the body i also set up its position to fixed...it works as expected, but in the safari browser it won't display the target element if the user scrolled a little bit...what happens is:...(problematic part) body set to overflow hidden and position fixed, makes the page go back to the top and crop to the viewport..at this point, the click event seems to be gone but the target element did not display....if i then click again (without scrolling before), the (problematic part) does not happen, and everything works normal...i added a tiny delay to the display block rule but it does not do the trick neither...// toggle menu on click.menutrigger.addeventlistener('click', function(){..if(window.getcomputedstyle(menutarget).display === 'none'){..    // disable body movement.    document.body.style.overflow='hidden';.    document.body.style.position='fixed';..    // set menu height.    var finalheight = (window.innerheight - document.queryselector("".main-header"").offsetheight - document.queryselector("".breadcrumb"").offsetheight);..    // show menu 50ms later to avoid safari bug.    settimeout(()=&gt;{.       menutrigger.classlist.add('open');.       menutarget.style.display = 'block';.       menutarget.style.height = finalheight + 'px';.    }, 50);..}else{..    closemenu();  ..}...notes: this is a very specific height that i need the target element to have, and i cannot achieve it with pure css...you can see the live problem here (the trigger element is the menu bars on the top right)...thanks for your attention."
