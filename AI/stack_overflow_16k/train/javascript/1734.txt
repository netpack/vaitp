"script validation a number 1-100 so i need to write a script that validates a number that is great than zero and less than 100. the catch is that the number can only be accepted if there is decimal in the middle postion and has atleast two decimal places...examples: 19.30 would validate.. 9.3,9.30 and 19.3 would be considered invalid...i'm thinking a regular expressions would be the best way to validate the decimal criteria?"
