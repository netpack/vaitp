"how to compare the equality of classes in blank? let's say i have a class like as follows...export const min_experience = 0;.export const max_experience = 100;..export class character {.  constructor(experience=0) {.    this._experience = experience;.  }.}...i want to compare two characters and see which is greater, and this will be defined by who has more experience...const lowlevelcharacter = new character(min_experience);.const highlevelcharacter = new character(max_experience);..console.log(lowlevelcharacter &lt; highlevelcharacter); // should return `true`....in a language like python, this might be implemented via the usage of __eq__, __gt__, or __lt__ ""dunder"" methods. however, i don't find this same concept included within the documentation for es6 and es7...how should this be implemented in blank?"
