"mastering blank function.bind() function def() {.    console.log(this.x).}..var f = def.bind({ x:777 }).f() // prints 777...the bind creates a function f which is identical to def, except that within f, this is set to { x:777 }...is it possible to access the object f was bound to outside of f? e.g., console.log(f.this.x) (but that doesn't work).  or is it impossible for code that comes after to see what object f was bound to?"
