"blank syntax my programing background is that i learned a little java in school.  blank syntax tends to confuse me for some reason. the blank code below is a pattern of syntax that i don't know what to make of:..foo.ready = function(variable){... var whatever = variable.bar();...one of my main points of confusion is the parameter.  for a contrasting example, in java, if i call a method with one parameter, the call sends one parameter.  i don't see how the parameter named 'variable' is ever set."
