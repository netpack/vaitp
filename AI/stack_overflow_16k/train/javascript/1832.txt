"check if both sides of the string are equal in blank i want to write a function to test if a string such as ""(())"" or ""&lt;&lt;>>"" is equal on both sides if they were reversed. where as something like ""((()"" would be false..is there a name for something like this? i assume is a common algorithm...for some reason, reverse doesn't do anything on right after splitting it into an array?....function ifequal(str) {.  let left = str.slice(0, str.length / 2);.  let right = str.slice(str.length / 2).split("""").reverse().join("""");.  console.log(left);.  console.log(right);..  return left === right;.}..ifequal(""(())"")"
