"remove class onclick anything else this may seem like a really simple question, but i'm having a lot of trouble trying to get it to work. ..i have a series of elements spread across different parts of a page...&lt;span class=""click-element""&gt;&lt;span&gt;.---.&lt;span class=""click-element""&gt;&lt;span&gt;.--.&lt;span class=""click-element""&gt;&lt;span&gt;...i want to toggle a class (""active"") on/off on each of them when they are clicked individually, this should also remove the class from all the others. ..to do this, my function looks like this:..var targets = document.queryselectorall('.click-element');..    for (i = 0; i &lt; targets.length; i++) {.        targets[i].addeventlistener('click', function () {.            var clicked = this;.            if (this.classlist.contains(""active"")) {.                [].foreach.call(targets, function (a) {a.classlist['remove']('active');});.            }.            else {.                [].foreach.call(targets, function (a) {a.classlist[a == clicked ? 'add' : 'remove']('active');});.            }..        });.    }...but what i'm trying to do, is then remove the class when anything else is clicked in the document:..document.addeventlistener('click', function () {.     document.queryselector('.click-element.active').classlist.remove(""active"");.});...however, the problem i'm having is the second event seems to just override the first. how can i fix this? or is there a cleaner approach to do what i want?..no jquery thanks"
