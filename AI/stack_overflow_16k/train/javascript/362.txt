"am using blank to connect user login to my website am using a blank to connect users to the homepage after the processing page have finish loading and sent the user to the homepage of welcome.html but the fact is how do i end the session after the click the log out button, because after signing out and if they hit back they will still get back the welcome.html, i have try disabling the back button in the browser but that's not awesome, i just need to kill the session so that it won't get them back to the welcome.html after they sign out instead it goes back to login page and require them to sign back in to access the welcome.html, and in this fact am not using php or db to connect the user login, am using blank, i don't know if it could work maybe with php simple line of codes or tags...here is my blank code, i use to connect the users:..function login(form){....var done=0;....var username=document.login.username.value;....username=username.tolowercase();....var password=document.login.password.value;....password=password.tolowercase();...if (username==""jonson111"" &amp;&amp; password==""happy111"") { window.location=""homeaccess_uche/processing.html""; done=1;}..if (username==""wilsonqaz"" &amp;&amp; password==""open123qaz"") { window.location=""homeaccess_wilson/processing.html""; done=1; }..if (done==0) { alert(""username or password is not in the database please try again!""); }...}...am using dreamweaver and yes i know i will encrypt the java codes so that users will not understand it, but i just need to end the session after they sign out, this have given me a hard time to figure out i have search everywhere in google but nothing, anyone can help?"
