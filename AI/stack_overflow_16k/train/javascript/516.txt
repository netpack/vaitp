"blank greybox -- slidehow won't work in ff/safari is anybody familiar with greybox blank plugin? .orangoo.com/labs/greybox/..it's for slideshows and stuff.. i can't get it to work in ff/safari; it works great in ie, but ff/safari won't play ball....orensanz.org/photos.html..would very much appreciate some suggestions.. .supposedly there's a google group (forum) for this thing (can't post url.. this thing limits how many urls u can include in a post, it's linked to from their home pg (url above..   oh brother..) but when you link to it you land on a pg that says they've been booted out b/c they violated google's terms of service....;-)..thank you.."
