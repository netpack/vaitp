"is there a way to inspect a clousure in blank (or local variables) i want to do something like:..function example(name){.  var age = 0;.  var started = false;.  var start = function(){.    started = true;.  }.  this.forward = function(){.    age++;.  }.  console.log( somecode );.}..example('boby');...i expect in somecode something that print some similar to:..name: ""boby"".age: 0.started: false.start: [function].forward: [function]...i like to write something like:..function inspect(locals){.  for(var name in locals){.    console.log(name, ':', locals[name]);.  }.}..console.log(inspect(example.locals));.// or.console.log(inspect(example.stack[-1].locals));.// or.console.log(inspect(example.clousure));...my aim is to program automatized tools for debuging inside my programs, or write general prupouse logs. or print call stack with values of local variables."
