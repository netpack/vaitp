"memory overflow in blank with ""+="" i need to concat hundreds of blank strings like this:..var result = '';.for (var i = 0; i &lt; 300; i ++ ) {.    result += data[i] + 'some dynamic text';.}...the data[i] is pretty large (like 300kb or more, it's image's base64 represents)...when i execute this code, the browser pops up an memory overflow error.(the break point is result += data[i])..how can i optimize this code to avoid this kind of memory issue ?..==== edit ====.i didn't make it clear before, so you can consider the data[i] is pretty large and i can't change it. every concat is also append some dynamic text."
