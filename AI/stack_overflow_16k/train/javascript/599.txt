"blank select input previous selection i don't have much experience with blank so i' not sure if/how this can be done. so i have a number of select components with a couple of options. one of these options for all of the components is ""all"". ..now i need to make sure that no more than one component has ""all"" selected. i'm using some input fields and making some validations to make sure this condition stands. however i can't see how i can do the following. when a user selects ""all"" from a field, and this is not allowed because there is already an ""all"" on the page, put the previous selection in it's place...so far what i have is (component being the current select component):..selectedname = component.options[component.selectedindex].innerhtml;.if (selectedname == 'all') {.  if (emptyallspace() == 1) {.    //here i do all the mumbo jumbo needed and assign to the hidden field the name of .    //the component.  } .  else {.    //here is where i should put back the old selection value. .  }. }...now the else branch is where i need to figure something out. so how can i / how difficult would it be to get the selected option before the currently selected one. ..i'm also interested how difficult it would be because i could also go another route and just put as selected the first option that is not 'all' but i would rather avoid this if it's no too time consuming...regards,.bogdan"
