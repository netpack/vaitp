"what is the purpose of ""x = x || 0""? in looking through some code i found online, i found this peculiar line of code (blank):..function values(b) {.    this.b = b || 0;.}...i simply can't figure out what the purpose of the ||0. if i'm not mistaken, since || returns a boolean, this value, b will always be whatever the boolean equivalent of the parameter is. if b is passed as true (ie 1 or true), then b should be true; otherwise, using one of the false values (ie. nan, 0), this should be false. i then interpret this as the following:..b is true:..this.b = true || false; // will evaluate to true...b is false:..this.b = false || false; // will evaluate to false...i just don't see the value gained by adding ||0. could someone please explain this to me?"
