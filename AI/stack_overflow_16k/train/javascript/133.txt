"blank storing global variables in dom i have a fairly large script that contains about 60 global variables. i'm thinking about using the namespace pattern to encapsulate my script and have only one global variable that references one object...even though this pattern is considered best practice, i'm also thinking about an alternative: storing the global variables inside the dom, in hidden divs, and accessing them with $('#myglobalvar1').text(). is this a good idea or not?..thanks for your suggestions."
