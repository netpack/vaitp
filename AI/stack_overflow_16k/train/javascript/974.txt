"add an extra step to column in blank game i created this arcade game by going through a few different tutorials and now i can't seem to finish it. i need to add an extra step so the player only wins when it steps into the water. at the moment the player wins when they step onto the final block. ..any direction would be appreciated, https://github.com/cathyxxx/arcade-game"
