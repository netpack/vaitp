"blank: what does this syntax mean (0,functionname)(functionparemeter); i was wondering into the blank file from the source of http://www.google.com actually i do it often and try to understand what they have done there. today i was wondering inside the files and found some strange function calls. maybe its a silly thing but i really have no idea what is it and so that i couldn't help by searching for it...a readable resemble of the code-..var somefunction = function(somaeparamenter){.    //do some stuffs;.    return something;.}..var someotherthing = (0, somefunction)(oneparameter);...please excuse my lack of knowledge...edit:..source-..i'm using chrome..while in the http://www.google.com page open, i opened the developer tool. then i opened the sources tab and opened the file https://www.google.com.bd/xjs/_/js/s/c,sb,cr,cdos,vm,tbui,mb,wobnm,cfm,abd,bihu,kp,lu,m,tnv,amcl,erh,hv,lc,ob,r,rsn,sf,sfa,shb,srl,tbpr,hsm,j,p,pcc,csi/rt=j/ver=wuw4ydif-wi.en_us./am=ga/d=1/sv=1/rs=aitrstpu52cumknqsh0was81vrm4inla_w in viewer. this file is the only js file i've seen there. i enabled the ""pretty print"" and in line 58 you'll find the defination-.._.va = function(a) {.            var b = typeof a;.            if (""object"" == b).                if (a) {.                    if (a instanceof window.array).                        return ""array"";.                    if (a instanceof window.object).                        return b;.                    var c = window.object.prototype.tostring.call(a);.                    if (""[object window]"" == c).                        return ""object"";.                    if (""[object array]"" == c || ""number"" == typeof a.length &amp;&amp; ""undefined"" != typeof a.splice &amp;&amp; ""undefined"" != typeof a.propertyisenumerable &amp;&amp; !a.propertyisenumerable(""splice"")).                        return ""array"";.                    if (""[object function]"" == c || ""undefined"" != typeof a.call &amp;&amp; ""undefined"" != typeof a.propertyisenumerable &amp;&amp; !a.propertyisenumerable(""call"")).                        return ""function"".                } else.                    return ""null"";.            else if (""function"" == b &amp;&amp; ""undefined"" == typeof a.call).                return ""object"";.            return b.        };...and in line 83 you'll see the function is called..._.za = function(a) {.            return ""array"" == (0, _.va)(a).        };"
