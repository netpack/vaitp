"understanding this in call and apply as per definition of call and apply, they execute function on given context..but, following code returned object{} for this..function animal() {.    this.name = ""lion"";.    this.id = 1;.    this.getinstance = function() {.        return this;.    }.}.var myobj2 = {};.var myobj = new animal();.myobj.getinstance.call(myobj2); //object {}...when i used self to store the this, then it returned animal object. ..function animal() {.    self = this;.    this.name = ""lion"";.    this.id = 1;.    this.getinstance = function() {.        return self;.    }.}.var myobj2 = {};.var myobj = new animal();.myobj.getinstance.call(myobj2); //animal {name: ""lion"", id: 1, getinstance: function}...in both the cases, my understanding was it should return myobj2..what is possible explanation for this?"
