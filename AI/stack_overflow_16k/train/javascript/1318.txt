"how to change outer functions arguments i have a program that looks at two points and does operations with them. i need to always make sure that the points are in the proper order though. i need the first point to be the smaller of the two. i am trying to write a utility function that i can call inside of the other functions to reorder the arguments that were passed in. any help in understanding why this isn't working would be amazing! ill do my best to only post relevant code..var unionfind = {.  data: [],     //this will be filled by a later function.  reorderpoints: function(num1, num2) {.    // useful utility to make sure points are in proper order.    // we will always keep the smaller number to show if points.    // are connected..    if(num1 &gt; num2) {.      debugger;.      point1 = num2;.      point2 = num1;.    }.  },.  union: function(point1, point2) {.    this.reorderpoints(point1, point2);.    // if the two points are already connected.    // then just return true.    if(this.connected(point1, point2) === true) {.      return true;.    }.    // otherwise loop through the data array and.    // change all entries that are connected to.    // the first point to the value of the first.    // point.    for(var i = 0; i &lt; this.data.length; i++) {.      if(this.data[i] === point2) {.        this.data[i] = point1;.      }.    }.  },..  connected: function() {.    this.reorderpoints(point1, point2);.    return this.data[point1] === this.data[point2];.  },.  initdata: function(num) {.    for(var i = 0; i &lt;= num; i++) {.      this.data[i] = i;.    }.  }.};..unionfind.initdata(9);.console.log(unionfind.data);..unionfind.union(4,3);.console.log(unionfind.data);"
