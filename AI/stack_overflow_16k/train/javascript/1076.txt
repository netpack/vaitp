"blank sleep ....settimeout from within setinterval blank does settimeout work from within setinterval?..i'm writing some blank to animate some dom elements for a strange artistic project..the best way for me to explain my question is to give an example:..i have 50 different divs that i need to animate by changing their position on screen, using setinterval. i need each div to be moving at a different rate. ..the solution i planned to use was to have a sleep function within my larger changeposition function, so that i could pass a different sleep value for each div. this way, i could assign a unique rate of movement for each div via a dictionary. ..the issue that i'm having is that blank does not have ""sleep"". it only has settimeout, which does not seem to be working from within my setinterval loop."
