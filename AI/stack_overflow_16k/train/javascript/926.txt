"what regular expression would i use to grab a certain part of this link? https://www.twitch.tv/averagepothead/clip/tiredroughelksquadgoals..i would like to use a regular expression to specifically grab everything after /clip/, aka the five random words that denotes the clip ""id"". i've been looking up other examples on here, but unfortunately when i write my own expressions based on that i don't get it exactly right... if anyone would be able to point me in the right direction that would be amazing. thank you!"
