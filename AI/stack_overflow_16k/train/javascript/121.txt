"trying to animate vexflow blank i am following these https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/animation-with-vexflow-&amp;-css instructions. i have copied the configuration verbatum, but error occurs: svgconext is not defined. i have vexflow-debug.js included as a script. i'm not entirely sure if it defines svgconent but it seems to. anyway, i include svgcontent.js which seems sensible but it returns werror: unspected token input...can you help?"
