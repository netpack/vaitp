"display one div at a time and disable active div's button as you can see, 3 divs are created using blank when their respective buttons are clicked. i pass their values and then use those to create the content. i am not sure if this is the best way... but anyway...the problem is that the divs keep appending. i only want to show one div at a time, and i also want to disable the active div's button. i've seen that you can use something like document.queryselector('button[onclick]').disabled = true;, but i am unsure of how to make it dynamically work because it would have to be set to false once any of the other buttons are clicked...here is my blank that is responsible for creating the content:..function showdiv(name) {.    var selectedbutton = name.value;.    var div = document.createelement('div');.    div.id = 'mydiv';.    document.body.appendchild(div);..    if (selectedbutton === 'home') {.        div.innerhtml = 'hi, this is a test for the ' + selectedbutton + ' div.';..    } else if (selectedbutton === 'about') {.        div.innerhtml = 'hi, this is a test for the ' + selectedbutton + ' div.';..    } else if (selectedbutton === 'contact') {.        div.innerhtml = 'hi, this is a test for the ' + selectedbutton + ' div.';.    }.}...my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wwen39o9/"
