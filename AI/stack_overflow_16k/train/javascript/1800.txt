"creating text file diffs in the browser with blank i'm rewriting a script that is used to summarize regression testing results. the program being tested spits out a few different text files, and any changes in these files between code versions are of interest to the developers. the old script used the command line diff utility on every single file, which takes a considerable amount of time (there are 2000ish tests, and 3 files to compare per test. this took about 30 minutes on our standard development machines). then it generated an html file that contains a table with links to all non-null diffs...as a developer, i've come to realize that, while they are often useful, most of those diffs are never looked at. one idea i had to speed this process is to compare the files using python filecmp.cmp tool, and create a table of all of the differences. then, use blank to diff only the links that are clicked on, using the diff_match_patch tool. these results would be displayed in the browser. i think i understand the api for diff_match_patch, but  i'm stuck trying to load these files into the blank environment...i've tried opening these files in an iframe (which i'd make invisible), but i cannot seem to access the files' content once they are open. i realize there are same-origin rules, but i would be reading the files from the same drive as the html file resides, which i think should be legal(?). i'm not sure if my problem is with my understanding of the dom, or if this just isn't possible. my knowledge of blank is quite minimal/outdated which may be the real problem, but this seems to be a strange use case so i've had trouble finding any examples. if there's a quirk with browsers, i do have the ability to mandate which browser is used. here's what i have so far, it's just a test to see what i've got loaded and what i'm accessing. in chrome i get nothing added to the div, and in firefox i get ""undefined"":..&lt;html&gt;.&lt;head&gt;.  &lt;script type=""text/blank"" language=""blank""&gt;.    function changesrc() {.    var base = document.getelementbyid(""base"");.    base.src=""../result/test1.txt"";.    var mod = document.getelementbyid(""mod"");.    mod.src=""../result/test2.txt"";..    var result =  mod.contentwindow.document.body.innertext;.    document.getelementbyid('result').innerhtml = '&lt;br&gt;' + result;.    }.  &lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/head&gt;..&lt;body&gt;.  &lt;iframe id=""base"" src=""""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;.  &lt;iframe id=""mod"" src=""""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;.  &lt;span onclick=""changesrc();"" style=""cursor: pointer;""&gt;loadfiles&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;.  &lt;div id=""result""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;...i'd appreciate any help making this work, or advice telling me i'm wasting my time. i'm also open to other outside-the-box ideas; maybe the time savings, given i'll need to run filecmp.cmp, won't be worth the trouble? thanks in advance!..edit: the question is a 2-parter i guess: .1) how do i read in a text file to use in a blank function (as a string)? .2) is this a bad idea?"
