"can someone help me with my hangman guessing letter issue? i'm currently working on a project for my coding class, and i'm having issues with my code. my code is adding correct letters to the wrongletters array and i'm unsure why. it also only does this for the second correct letter and onward being inputted, meaning that if i guessed one correct letter correctly it would add it to the correctletters array, however every correct letter after that would result in it being added both to correctletters and wrongletters when it should only be added to correctletters. if you can help please do, i'm very confused. thank you...this link will bring to my current code on codepen. with the html and css. you will find the issue in the js portion of my code thank you, which is below as well...var guesswords = [""school"", ""test"", ""quiz"", ""pencil"", ""ruler"", ""protractor"", ""teacher"", ""homework"", ""science"", ""math"", ""english"", ""history"", ""language"", ""elective"", ""bully"", ""grades"", ""recess"", ].var secretword = guesswords[math.floor(math.random()*guesswords.length)];.var wrongletters = [].var correctletters = [].var repeatletters = [].function startgame() {.  var testword = document.getelementbyid(""randtest"").innerhtml = secretword; .  var correctlettersout = """";.    document.getelementbyid(""currentguess"").innerhtml = secretblanks(secretword).    function secretblanks(secretword) {.      for (var i = 0; i &lt; secretword.length; i++) {.        correctlettersout+=(""_ "");.        } return correctlettersout;..}}.function correctword() {.  var guessletter = document.getelementbyid(""guessletter"").value;.  document.getelementbyid(""letter"").innerhtml = guessletter;.. for (i=0; i &lt; secretword.length; i++) {.     if (correctletters.indexof(guessletter) === -1)..        if (guessletter === secretword[i]) {.          correctletters.push(guessletter);.        } else if(wrongletters.indexof(guessletter) === -1) {.          wrongletters.push(guessletter);.        }. }..  console.log(correctletters);.  console.log(wrongletters);.  console.log(repeatletters);.}"
