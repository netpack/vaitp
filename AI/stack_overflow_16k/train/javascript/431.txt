"blank array.reduce divide i have code in my application that multiplies numbers together using array.reduce..it looks like this:..// private function to multiply field values together.function _multiplefields(product, fields) {..    // calculate our total        .    var total = fields.reduce(function (total, field) {..        // get our number from our field.        var fieldvalue = helper.getpropertyvalue(product, field.trim()),.            number = _extractnumber(fieldvalue);..        return total * number;.    }, 1);..    // return our total.    return total;.};...i would like to use similar logic to divide numbers. .i thought i would be able to just change the operator, but total in the first iteration is equal to 1. for multiplication that is fine, but for division it isn't...can someone give me a hand?"
