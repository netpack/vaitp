"function that counts how often it call another function i have a 'twice' function that return 2 of the argument passed into it. i also have another function 'runtwice' that counts the number of times it called the 'twice' function (the idea being that i want the 'twice' function to only run 'twice' no matter how often it is called via the 'runtwice' function). can you please help?..functions are given below:....var count = 1;.    .function twice(num){.  return num*2;.}..function runtwice(func){.  if (count&lt;3){.    count++;.    return func;.  } else {.    return 'function cannot run!';.  }.}.    .var myfunc = runtwice(twice).    .var output = [];..for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){.  output.push(myfunc(i));.}..console.log(output);.....i would like the output to be [0, 2, 'function cannot run!']...i can make this work if i count the 'twice' function directly but i am looking to understand why this doesn't work as presented above."
