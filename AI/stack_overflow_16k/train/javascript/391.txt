"higher order functions - eloquent blank can someone please help me understand the below example. i think i am really close to getting it but something isn't clicking. i am confused about the relationship between the functions, specifically how the greaterthan10(11) exists without defining it earlier...function greaterthan(n) {.  return function(m) { return m &gt; n; };.}.var greaterthan10 = greaterthan(10);.console.log(greaterthan10(11));...any nudge in the right direction would be appreciated!.jh"
