"how to assign attributes to a blank variable so i'm in the process of making a medieval-themed game, and i need to have a system of equipping combinations of armor, weapons, and shields to different types of troops. i used to have a system that showed how many of any possible combination i had, but then it was hard to sift through the hundred combinations to see how many troops you have. so, i've decided to have a show all troops menu, but each troop needs to have three slots only: armor, weapon, and shield. as the troops start off as just ..    var basictroopamount = 0;...and as you recruit them the amount goes up. i just am asking if anyone knows a better way that each troop is ""personalized"" in the sense that each one can be equipped with different sets of armor and weapons, and how to tell the code that the armor variables are armor and cannot go in the weapon slot and that multiple armors cannot go into one slot. i know this question is pretty loaded, but if anyone has any input that would help a ton!"
