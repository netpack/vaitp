"how do i get the binary data of a file as a string of 1s and 0s? so, as part of a little experiment, i need to access the binary data of a file, an image for example, as a string or array of 1s and 0s. ..i read the documentation on the file reader, i'm attempting to use the readasbinarystring method but it gives me a bunch of weird characters rather than what i'd normally think a string of binary should look like. here's my code:..function handlefiles(files){.   var selectedfile = files[0];.   var reader = new filereader();.   reader.readasbinarystring(selectedfile);.   reader.onloadend = function () {.      var result = reader.result;.      store(result);.   }.}..function store(data){.    console.log('storing data...');.   console.log(data.slice(0, 1000));.}...as a web developer, i dont normally work with binary, so i'm probably fairly naive about this. can someone explain how i get actual 1s and 0s?"
