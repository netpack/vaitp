"is using 001 as a number same as 1 in blank? edit : this is not a duplicate of the other question as to realise why prepending 0's to numbers can actually result in a different value, this question has nothing to do with octals, in the other question does the significance of prepending 0's to a number resulting in a different (octal) value is not obvious...for code alignment to look nice, i formatted number of lines that would have an integer as an argument from 1,2,3,.. to 01,02,03,... ..are the two indistinguishable in blank? ( please don't mistake 01 with ""01"" they are different types. anyone knows of any example in any programming language where 1 and 01 will not be the same value?)."
