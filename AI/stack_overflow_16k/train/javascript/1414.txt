"is there a way to delay function calls or statements by a given amount in milliseconds? i am creating a chrome extension that, while on a udemy course page, checks all the videos, so the certificate will become available, but i am encountering a problem where i activate the click event on all the needed buttons, but this happens so fast that my console gets spammed with net::err_insufficient_resources, and only half of all the buttons get clicked and send the post request to the udemy servers. now i was looking for a sleep() function, and a google search told me there isn't one in blank. ..this is the code i am using. ..function clickbuttons() {.    var buttons = document.getelementsbyclassname(""curriculum-item--progress--3ekmj btn btn-default"").    for (i = 0; i &lt; buttons.length; i++) {.    clickbutton(buttons, i)..}..}.function clickbutton(buttonsarray, index){ .    buttonsarray[index].click();.}..clickbuttons();...if theres another way to circumvent this issue, that would also be appreciated."
