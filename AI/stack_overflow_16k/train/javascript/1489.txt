"throw new error when instantiation a function i'm trying to do a simple blank ""class"" with the help of a function. however, i want to validate if the input data is correct before setting the values. if the data is not correct, i want to throw a new error. this is what i came up with:..function testing(arg1, arg2) {.  if (arg1 !== '' &amp;&amp; arg2 !== '') {.    this.arg1 = arg1;.    this.arg2 = arg2;.  } else {.    throw new error('data is empty!');.  }.}...is this allowed in blank? what would be a better solution?.thank you for your answers!"
