"setting window.location vs. typing url? my main question is in bold at the bottom. i would love an answer to that especially but if you'd like to help me figure out the rest of the problem, please continue reading...i am working on a web application whose session expiration is being handled by a spring backend (it's the default tomcat 30-minute session expiration). if you are logged into the application and then you type in 'www.myapplication.com/portal/logout' (not the real url, obv.) you are logged out and redirected to the login page. great. however, if you set..window.location = 'http://www.myapplication.com/portal/logout' ...in the client-side blank, that url appears in the url bar in your browser but a whitelabel error page results which is being generated by another service on the backend. ..why is there a difference between typing the url versus setting window.location in the code? should there be a difference? or do you think this other service is funking with redirection? if so, why would the same error not occur when you type the url?..ps. i also tried window.location.href = url and window.location.replace(url), to the same effect."
