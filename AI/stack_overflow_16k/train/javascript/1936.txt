"keep losing incremental variable within for loop i've been fiddling with this for way too long and can't seem to get it working as it should..the problem i'm having is that i'm losing the value of my incremental variable in a for loop, specifically when it goes in to the if statement that i have inside of it.  ideally i want to iterate through an array until i find the correct value, attach a variable to that value and use it outside of the for loop.  this is the structure of the array i'm working with...var dxid = [. {url:""url1"", did:""id1""},. {url:""url2"", did:""id2""},          . {url:""url3"", did:""id3""}.];...and here is the loop that i'm running everything through:..for(i=0; i &lt; dxid.length; i++) {.    if (dxid[i].url == currenturl){.    var dataxuid = dxid[i].did;.    break;.    }...}   ..the incremental 'i' variable always reverts back to 0 within the if statement.  it's odd, the dxid[i].url comes up correctly, but the dxid[i].did pulls the first entry and 'i' seems to be lost after that. i'm sure there is a very simple solution to this, but blank is something that i just always seem to have trouble with."
