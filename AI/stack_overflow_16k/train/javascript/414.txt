"how to add items to a blank data array/object i'm not an expert with blank!..i have a simple array/object that i need to add to a blank table..something like this:..var columns = {.                ""0"": { ""styles"": ""width:22%;"" },.                ""1"": { ""styles"": ""width:13%;"" },.                ""2"": { ""styles"": ""width:13%;"" },.                ""3"": { ""styles"": ""width:13%;"" },.                ""4"": { ""styles"": ""width:13%;"" },.                ""5"": { ""styles"": ""width:13%;"" },.                ""6"": { ""styles"": ""width:13%;"" }.            };...however the ""columns"" variable has to change depending on how many records i have... so 0 will always be the same (22%) but 1-5 depends on how many columns defined by user and 6 is a ""total"" column. the width of 1-6 will change as well...i know how to get the number of columns but just not sure how i create the list of columns and produce something like above ""column"" declaration."
