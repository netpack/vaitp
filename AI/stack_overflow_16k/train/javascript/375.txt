"looping over objects in an array inside an object (with for...in) i have objects (people) inside an array (group) inside an object (data) like so:..const data = {.  g1 : [.    {""name"" : ""jack"", ""age"" : 32},.    {""name"" : ""jill"", ""age"" : 44}    .  ],.  g2 : [.    {""email"" : ""jane@example.com"", ""city"" : ""berlin"", ""age"" : 14},.    {""email"" : ""brad@example.com"", ""city"" : ""stockholm"", ""age"" : 22}.  ].}...say i want to console.log all age property values, i try: ..for (const group in data) {.  for (const person of group) {.    console.log(person.age).  }.}...this does not work. it seems for (const group in data) is only looping over the names of it's children. i assume i should not use for...in in this case, but what can i use? or is it somehow possible to use for...in? ..the reason i'm confused is because in for example php i could do: ..&lt;?php..$data = [.    ""g1"" =&gt; [.        [ ""name"" =&gt; ""jack"", ""age"" =&gt; 32 ],.        [ ""name"" =&gt; ""jill"", ""age"" =&gt; 44 ].    ],.    ""g2"" =&gt; [.        [ ""email"" =&gt; ""jane@example.com"", ""city"" =&gt; ""berlin"", ""age"" =&gt; 14 ],.        [ ""email"" =&gt; ""brad@example.com"", ""city"" =&gt; ""stockholm"", ""age"" =&gt; 22 ].    ].];...foreach ( $data as $group ) {.    foreach ( $group as $person ) {.        echo $person[ 'age' ];.    }.}...and in would work."
