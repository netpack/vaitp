"parsing jsonp file with blank how do i access the marie-antoinette.json object in this json file? i would like to get the title element of the object but i can't seem to get it to output. here is my blank code which outputs the object but i cant seem to access the objects elements... $.ajax(.    {.        type: 'get',.        url: 'http://localhost:5984/movies/efadd5913f5cfd254b2861efd4001cb7',.        //contenttype: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",.        datatype: ""jsonp"",.        jsonpcallback: 'callback',.        //async: false,.        success: function(r).        {.            alert(""ok"");.            $.each(r, function(index, value){ // iterating over each object.                console.log(index);.                if(index == ""_attachments"").                {.                    console.log(value); //how do i output the title (""marie-antoinette.json"") and the other stuff in the object?.                }..           });.        }.    });...here is the file. the elements i would like to access are in the ""_attachments"" element of the object...{.    ""_id"": ""efadd5913f5cfd254b2861efd4001cb7"",.    ""_rev"": ""6-417588bbff9aa74726b11440a86a8532"",.    ""_attachments"": {.        ""marie-antoinette.json"": {.            ""content_type"": ""application/json"",.            ""revpos"": 2,.            ""digest"": ""md5-io/pxakfp/4r8ntjqkwmdg=="",.            ""length"": 761,.            ""stub"": true.        }.    }.}...i think what is throwing me off is that it is an object inside the _attachment section."
