"can you explain how this factorial function works? i understand that ""a"" solution is:..function factorial(number).{.    if(number == 0 || number == 1){.        return 1;.    }..    return number * factorial(number -1);..}...i want to understand what exactly is going on.  i understand what is going on all the way to the last part when number == 1...if we were to take a simple example of say 3!...3 is not equal to 0 or 1 so we return 3 * factorial(2).2 is not equal to 0 or 1 so we return 2 * factorial(1).1 is equal to 1 so we return 1...how do we know when to stop? is it the fact that we return 1 that tells the function to stop?..if that is the case, why does the function not stop when we first return 3 * factorial(2)?  is it because it's returning a function so that it must continue until it no longer returns a function?..thank you"
