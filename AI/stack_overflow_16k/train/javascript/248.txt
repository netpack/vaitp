"persist variables instead of global variables in blank i want to have one button, functioning as both the ""start"" and ""stop"" button for some reoccurring timed events...to do this, i can have a global variable on the top of everything:..toggleon = false; ...and then, inside of &lt;button onclick=""..., i can have:..toggleon =! toggleon;.foo(); .function foo() {.  // do my stuff.  if (toggleon) {.    settimeout(foo, 5000);.  }.}...but the problem is, i must not use a global variable to complete the same task. how should i do it? is there a persist variable that can carry a value outside its scope?"
