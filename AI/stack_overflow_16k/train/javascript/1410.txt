"how to find out which image in an has my variable been assigned to? i have an array of images; ..var imagearray = new array();       .imagearray[0] = new image();.imagearray[0].src = ""first.png"";.imagearray[0].id = ""first"";.imagearray[1] = new image();.imagearray[1].src = ""second.png"";.imagearray[1].id = ""second"";...and it is randomly assigned to a variable by : ..var hobby = new bitmap( imagearray[math.floor(math.random() * imagearray.length)]);.hobby.onpress= alerting();...what i am trying to do is create an alert when each image is clicked. i want the alert to be the image id. the following is what i tried to do but it didn't work. what i'm i doing wrong. is there better way of doing this rather than if statements? ..function alerting(){.    if (hobby = imagearray[0]){.        alert(""first"").    }.    else {.        alert(""second"").    }.}"
