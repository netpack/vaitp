"how to use a break statement in a blank loop? i was trying to write a script to detect whether the number is a prime number or not. the function works on some numbers fine, surprisingly it prints the number 133 as a prime number which is false. i'm suspecting the problem is with my break statement, so please correct if that is the case...here is my code:..function prime(num){.    if (num == 1){console.log(num + "" is not a prime number"");}.    else if (num == 2){console.log(num + "" is a prime number"");}.    else if (num !==2 &amp;&amp; num !==1){.        for (var i = 2; i&lt;num;  i++ ){ // num = 7.            if (num % i == 0){.                console.log(num + "" is a not prime number"");.                break;.            }.            else{.                console.log(num + "" is a prime number"");.                break;.            }.        }.    }.}"
