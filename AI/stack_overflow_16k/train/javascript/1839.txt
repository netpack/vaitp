"why doesn't blank have a sleep function? what technical or other reasons prevent the implementation of sleep() in blank?..update: i'm aware of ways to delay execution of code (settimeout, setinterval etc.) the problem these create is that the developer is forced to split the code block into two parts, that which is executed before the time-gap, and that which is executed afterwards, which is arguably undesirable."
