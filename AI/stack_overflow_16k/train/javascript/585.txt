"returns the cube of the sum of an input and 2 i'm taking online class to learn js and i'm stuck.  the quiz is asking me to:..returns the cube of the sum of an input and 2...so i coded this:..var returncubed = function(num){ return (num + 2) * 3;};...but it doesn't pass.  what else can i do to take in a parameter, add two to it, then cube it?  or am i not understanding the directions?"
