"how do i find out what blank runs when i click an element? i am looking at the bing maps site. i am opening up the my places editor and clicking the polyline tool in the drawing toolbar...i would like to discover what blank runs when i click on tools in the drawing toolbar...i have looked at the html and there is no onclick event declared on the element...i have done text searches on all of the scripts referenced by the page, for the id of the polyline tool element. this was to try to find blank that attaches a click event to the element, but i got no matches at all...there must be some script running when i click on a tool. how do i find out what script is executing when i click the tool divs in the toolbar?..i don't think there is anyway i can set breakpoints if i don't first know what script to set them on. is there anyway i can trap the blank that runs to discover what it is, either in ie f12 developer tools or in firebug?"
