"undefined, typeof undefined, hasownproperty take this snippet,..var a = {..}..if(typeof a.c === 'undefined'){. console.log('inside if');.}.if(a.c === undefined){. console.log('inside if');.}...both if results in true. is there any difference in both statements specific to some browsers?..also, in my last project i have already used typeof a.c == 'undefined' numerous times to check values in json data...now, i know that this is not good way, as some value may be undefined too, so my logic will fail. ..i should have used hasownproperty ...but i am sure that no value will be undefined , can i use typeof a.c == 'undefined' in place of hasownproperty or should i change all my typeof with hasownproperty"
