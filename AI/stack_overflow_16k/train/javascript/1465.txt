"stop window.location to if deeplink to app works so i have the following button on the site...&lt;img class=""openapp"" onclick=""loadapporplaystore();"" src=""img/open_in_app.png"" width=""35px""/&gt;...i then have this function,..  function loadapporplaystore() {.    var url = window.location.pathname;.    var item = url.substring(url.lastindexof('/')+1);.    window.location.href = 'url' + item;.    settimeout(""window.location = 'url_to_play_store';"", 1000);.  }...the problem is, even though i have the application, the application does work. when i go back into the browser on the phone, the url_to_play_store is there. can i stop that from happening if the application is loading?"
