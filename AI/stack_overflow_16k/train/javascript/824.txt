"return primitive value of blank number i have a simple string extension to convert to numbers:..string.prototype.toint = function(){ return parseint(this); }..because it's rather difficult without comments to know what kind of value you are getting in js, i want to protect myself if i try to cast a number to a number that i thought was a string. i thought this would work:..number.prototype.toint = function(){ return this;}..but this returns the entire function. i see that there is a [[primitivevalue]] property in number that ideally i could return, but i cannot figure out how to access it (such as this['[[primitivevalue]]'])"
