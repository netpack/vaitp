"can the bgcolor attribute be passed to a pop-up window? i have the code below to open a pop-up window which works fine. the pop-up has a black background controlled within the body tag of the code in the pop-up itself. ..when the pop-up initially opens, the page has a white background then goes black once the code loads. this doesn't bother me but it does bother my client! ..so, is there a way that i can pass the bgcolor color attribute to the pop-up from the blank that is on the parent page, so that the pop-up is immediately black when it opens. i hope that makes sense! ..here is my current code:..// start of pop up ///////////////////////////////////////////////////..function popupcenter(pageurl, title,w,h) {.    var left = (screen.width/2)-(w/2);.    var top = (screen.height/2)-(h/2);.    var targetwin = window.open (pageurl, title, 'toolbar=no, location=no, directories=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=yes, resizable=no, copyhistory=no, width='+w+', height='+h+', top='+top+', left='+left);.}..// end of pop up ///////////////////////////////////////////////////..&lt;a href=""blank:void(0);"" onclick=""popupcenter('page.asp', 'mypop1',678,550);"" class=""staffbiolinks""&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;"
