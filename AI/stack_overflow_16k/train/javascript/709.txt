"blank find adjacencies i have a ""class"" called block. it possesses three variables : x, y, and z, which are its three-dimensional coordinates, respectively. i am having trouble finding the number of ""neighbours"" to a block. that is, if this shares a face, edge, or vertex with other, it should return true. so, block.neighbours() returns the number of neighbours to block. however, it is returning 0 rather than the expected 1. my code is shown below:..var blocks = [];..  function block(x, y, z) {.    blocks.push(this);.    this.x = x;.    this.y = y;.    this.z = z;.    this.neighbours = function() {.      var n = 0;.      for (var block in blocks) {.        if (block == this) {.          continue;.        }.        if (math.abs(block.x - this.x) &lt;= 1 &amp;&amp; math.abs(block.y - this.y) &lt;= 1 &amp;&amp; math.abs(block.z - this.z) &lt;= 1) {.          n++;.        }.      }.      return n;.    };.  }..  var b1 = new block(0, 0, 0);.  var b2 = new block(0, 1, 0);.  document.getelementbyid(""box"").innerhtml = b1.neighbours();...why is the function returning 0? (note: before the blank i have the html &lt;p id = ""box""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, and in the paragraph it shows 0)."
