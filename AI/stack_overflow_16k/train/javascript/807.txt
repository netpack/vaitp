"typeerror: x.y is not a function, when apparently it is i'm experiencing a strange behavior off of blank yet again. i find this to be extremely illogical and confusing.....i probably did kind of a mess drawing over the picture but briefly, you see that $$('h2') is clearly an object which has a method on, or in blank language a property on which turns out to be a function, however when i try to access that function i get a typeerror? ..my question is: why am i getting this error when obviously the object does have a property called on which is a function?..edit: here's the on function..on: function(event, func) {.        this.node.addeventlistener(event, func, false);.    }"
