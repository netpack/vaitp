"running blank code only during a specific time i'm trying to run a popup on my website just during specific times(11 am to 2 pm - client side/server side either). i'm using gethours() to check the current time, but something is wrong - the popup seems to not recognize the condition. below is the code -..&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt; .var now = new date();.if (now.gethours() &gt; 11 &amp;&amp; now.gethours() &lt; 14) .{.    //popup code.}.&lt;/script&gt;...thanks!"
