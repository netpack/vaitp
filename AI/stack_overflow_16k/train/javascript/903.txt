will blank become much less important in near future? i am a junior web developer and now i am also developing ios and android applications. i am just wondering if it is worthwhile to invest much time and energy in learning blank and developing in blank. i am not sure whether html 5 or css3 will totally replace blank or creating cross-platform applications will not need blank?..thanks
