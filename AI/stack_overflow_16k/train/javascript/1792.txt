"can this for loop in blank be altered to repeat the prompt questions if they are not filled in? i have completed this code challenge and have been trying to see if it can be altered to repeat the prompt questions, if they are not filled in by the user?  i was able to do this using a while loop and am wondering if this is possible to do in a for loop.  i have played around with conditional statements, but i am a beginner and have had no luck so far.  if anyone is able to let me know if this is possible and explain how, it would be much appreciated...// for loop code challenge.. //write the varibales needed for this..var quote;.var author;.var authorandquote;..// what do the variables = to?  you will need a length property for a for loop to function with what you know..var quote =  prompt(""please write a well known quote below?"");.var author = prompt(""please write the author to this quote below?"");.var authorandquote = 'quote' + 'author';..for(var i = 0; i &lt; authorandquote.length; i += 1){..}..// print it to the console..console.log(""your quote was "" + quote + "" your author was "" + author + ""."");.....// while loop code challenge...//write the varibales needed for this.var quote;.var author;.. //use the ! in a while loop to state while this is not true keep prompting the question..while (!quote) {.  quote = prompt(""please write a well known quote below?"");.}..while (!author) {.  author = prompt(""please write the author to this quote below?"");.} .. //print the answer to the console..console.log(""your quote was "" + quote + "" your author was "" + author + ""."");"
