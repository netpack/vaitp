"difference in terminology? js scope i'm getting more in the oo side of js now and less basic dom manipulation and interaction parts. the one thing that is confusing as i'm brushing up on my books is the terminology of global, local, public, private variables...from what i gather it seems that private/public is more borrowed from java users crossing over but in fact they're simply global and local variables...am i wrong in assuming this?"
