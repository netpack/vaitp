"what are the best practices to follow when declaring an array in blank? when i need to declare a new array i use this notation..var arr = new array();...but when testing online, for example on jsbin, a warning signals me to ""use the array literal notation [].""..i didn't find a reason to avoid using the constructor. is in some way less efficient than using []? or is it bad practice?..is there a good reason to use var arr = []; instead of var arr = new array();?"
