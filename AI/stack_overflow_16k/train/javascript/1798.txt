"how to get max width of a set of divs based on their class? i am trying to figure out a blank function that upon an event (like 'onchange'). will chack the width of all div with a certain class, select the max and set the width of that class to that max. i know how to do the second part but i have a problem with identifying the max width for a class. the divs of the same class are located in diffrent parent divs and their id's are incremented like: div1, div2, div3 ... if that helps at all. i know there are a couple of very similar questions here but i could not find the answer to when it's to be based on class and when the divs are located in different parent divs. thank you"
