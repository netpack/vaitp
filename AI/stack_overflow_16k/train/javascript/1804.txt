dynamically load blank files and make sure they are cached i want to load my blank files after the page is loaded and make sure that they are being cached...this question has been asked and answered a lot but they all suggest loading it with jquery ($.getscript) while one of the files i want to load is the jquery itself and i can not use jquery. there are some options like:..(function(){.  var newscript = document.createelement('script');.     newscript.type = 'text/blank';.     newscript.async = false;  //as i'm going to execute some functions .                               //after this i want to make sure that the .                               //script is fully loaded.     newscript.src = 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js';.  (document.getelementsbytagname('head')[0]||document.getelementsbytagname('body')[0]).appendchild(newscript);.})();...but i'm not sure if they are cached or not..and is there a way to fire an event when dynamically loading script is done?
