defining a containing variable and then immediately overwriting it the following pattern is found throughout a blank codebase. a variable is defined and initialized either with its value if it already exists or with an empty object. it is then immediately overwritten...var outervariable = outervariable || {};.outervariable = {.    // inner variable definitions follow.    // ....};...does this pattern serve any useful purpose?
