"cannot create property on string i have stumbled on a weird issue when trying to recursively set properties on an empty object with the following code:..simplified code..const birthdays = {};..// loop -&gt; passing day, id and birthday.birthdays[day] = day;.birthdays[day][id] = birthday;...example of day: '01012017'..example of id: 1547..example of birthday: {name: john}..error message..cannot create property '123' on string '06012017'...i saw some people with angular having this issue but their answer don't solve anything for me (as is angular specific syntax etc)."
