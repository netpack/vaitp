"blank function that works like location.pathname but without returning the folders before root i am looking for a blank function that will return the path from the root of the current file...i have come across location.pathname and that gives me what i need but with the path from volumes to the root included. for example, location.pathname would return:../volumes/macintosh%20hd/users/me/github/root/folder1/folder2/folder3/index.html...i want something that will return only the following:../folder1/folder2/folder3/index.html"
