"why does "",,,"" == array(4) in blank? boot up your interpreter/console and try the comparison..&gt; "",,,"" == array(4).true...why?  at first i thought maybe since you could think of "",,,"" as an array of four characters with a '0' terminating slice, that might be why, but..&gt; ""..."" == array(4)...returns ""false"".  so... why?  i know it's some idiosyncratic bit of duck typing in blank, but just curious what underlines this behavior.  gleaned this from zed shaw's excellent presentation here btw."
