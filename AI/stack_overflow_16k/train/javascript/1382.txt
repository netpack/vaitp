"prototype inheritance in blank i took the following example from the book blank good parts and i ran it in firefox:..function.prototype.method = function(name, value){.    this.prototype[name] = value;.    return this;.}..number.method('integer', function (  ) {.    return math[this &lt; 0 ? 'ceil' : 'floor'](this);.});..console.log((-10 / 3).integer());...this is my understand of how it works. we use the () high precedence operator to evaluate -10/3, which gives this 64-bit floating point value -3.3... since blank has not float, decimal, or integer types, the return value is number. hence, we call the function integer() on number object, which is in its prototype chain. ""this"" must refer to the value the number object holds. we use ternary to check if its negative or positive and in this case we run: math'ceil' since it was negative. this will round the number upward to produce -3...this script will work, but what i don't understand is why number.method doesn't throw an exception, since number is not a type of function and method was defined on function's prototype, not number's prototype and number doesn't inherit from function, it only inherits from object.prototype."
