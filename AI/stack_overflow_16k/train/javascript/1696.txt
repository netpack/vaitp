"can't execute js script, returned value appears on screen and stops script i made script for myself to use in browser game - tribal wars...document.getelementbyid(""mp_att"").click();.settimeout(.    function(){.        trooptemplates.usetemplate(1889);.        document.getelementbyid(""target_attack"").click();.    },700 .); .settimeout(.    function(){.        document.getelementbyid(""troop_confirm_go"").click();.    },1000 .);...everything works fine, when i type it into console (ctrl+shift+k) and it returns some kind of value like 476, but i wanted to use this script very often. but when i bookmark this script with a blank: prefix, it stops working. returned value appears on screen and stops the script. how to solve this problem?..to be more exact:..document.getelementbyid(""mp_att"").click();.select ""attack"" on selected village...then window is shown, and i have to select troops...trooptemplates.usetemplate(1889); selects them...this function, executed alone returns only ""false""..document.getelementbyid(""target_attack"").click();..code above chooses, that i want to attack this village...then one more popup is shown. (in case to confirm sending troops)..document.getelementbyid(""troop_confirm_go"").click();..this code confirms, and sends troops...how can i ignore/hide returned values? or maybe there is another way to quickly execute script?"
