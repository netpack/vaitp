"blank check for internet i have a web app that needs to check if the web browser is connected to the internet when the function below is called...function ping(){.    var xhttp = new xmlhttprequest();.    xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {.        if (this.readystate == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200) {.            // typical action to be performed when the document is ready:.            console.log(""response: "" + xhttp.responsetext);.        }.    };.    xhttp.open(""get"", ""http://www.google.com"", true);.    xhttp.send();.}...below are the function results from the google chrome console. it somewhat works.....when connected to the internet:...  failed to load https://www.google.com/: no.  'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested.  resource. origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access....when no internet connection:...  get https://www.google.com/ 0 ()...so, if i could differentiate between the errors, there would be my function, but i also have a feeling that this is a completely weird way of doing this. ..is there a better/simpler way of checking for an internet connection?"
