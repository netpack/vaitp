"loop through children of object until anchor is found with attribute x say i have a dom element. ..how would i do it in blank, to find out if that element has any children (or children of children) which is an &lt;a&gt; element which href attribute is '/'? and if so, return at which level (deep) is it?..so far i have this:..var children = element.children.var level = 1;.    for (var i=0; i &lt; children.length; i++) {.      if (children[i].nodename == 'a' &amp;&amp; children[i].href == '/') {.        return true;.      }.    }...how can i go to the children of the children?"
