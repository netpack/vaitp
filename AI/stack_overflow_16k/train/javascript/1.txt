"asynchronous access to window.external (blank) i'm assisting to develop a blank web application that's embedded into an external vendors software product.  our web application is given standard access to the parent applications data via calling window.external...what we've found is that when operations run slow within the parent application (e.g. window.external.getmydate(""big data"")) it locks our browser window. we have no control over the interface or parent application but are there any ways to run calls like this asynchronous within blank (using a call back similar to how a ajax call works)?..the goal is that our web application doesn't lock while we're accessing the parent data."
