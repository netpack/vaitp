"how to compare dates across timezones in blank? i'm trying to compare given date with current date, it is working fine for indian timezone but other time zones getting one day off. i have went through similar type of issues and there suggestions are like convert utc string. after converting utc string getting correct date while console but when comparing not get correct result. .here my given date in the format like 'yyyy-mm-dd'..the initial comparison was like below, and this will work fine for indian timezone.....              const datestring = '2019-05-06';.              const q = new date();.              const m = q.getmonth();.              const d = q.getdate();.              const y = q.getfullyear();.              const currentdate = new date(y, m, d);.              const givendate = new date(datestring);.              if (currentdate &lt;= givendate) {.                return null;.              } else {.                return {.                  'currentdatechecker': true.                };.              }.            }.....the above one will work fine for indian time zone and for some other time zone apart from indian time zone, it is giving one day less...but after converting to utc like:....const givendate = new date(datestring).toutcstring();.....now this will give correct date but for comparing purpose i have converted both current date also to utc string, by that time result is not coming as expected. i know there are number of articles existed related to this but not getting proper way so only posting this question."
