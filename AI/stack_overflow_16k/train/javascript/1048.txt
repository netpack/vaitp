"blank validation of numeric form field i have been trying to validate a text field for numeric with blank. i had it as a type ""number"" but ie 9 doesn't do this. this is the code i used: ..var c=document.getelementbyid(""employee_count"").value;.if (c&lt;=0).  {.  alert(""employee numbers must be filled out"");.  form1.employee_count.focus();.  return false;.  }.if (!is_int(c)) {.  alert(""employee numbers must be numeric"");.  form1.employee_count.focus();.  return false;.} ...i first validated that there was some input and this worked but when i put in the code with !is_int and put an alphabetic character in to test, the whole form submitted without any further validation of fields. can anyone spot what i am doing wrong? it is driving me crazy. if i omit the last if statement the subsequent code works correctly. thanks in advance, ..geoff."
