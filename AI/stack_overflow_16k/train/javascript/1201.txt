"tapermonkey dynamically clicking how do i simulate a click on a table row which does not have a onclick attribute.  usually when i clixk on it, a new page gets openesd. but how do i do it in my code? .let me make my question clearer. suppose     when i normally click on the first row.. it redirects to another page.  now since the onclick attribute does not have a function name i am not able to figure out what exactly is being called. now what i want to do is to simulate the click on the row. i can't change the source since its on the server, i am using inspector in chrome right now and tapermonkey to write js code.  click() function is not working."
