"why does this expression return the actual string literals in the conditional? why does this return statement return the appropriate strings for each valid condition?  is there something i'm missing about the &amp;&amp; operator?  it actually returns the ""just now"" or ""1 minute ago"" string or any other string that is in the code block and i'm just wondering what the reason is...return day_diff == 0 &amp;&amp; ( diff &lt; 60 &amp;&amp; ""just now"" ||.                          diff &lt; 120 &amp;&amp; ""1 minute ago"" ||.                  diff &lt; 3600 &amp;&amp; math.floor( diff / 60 ) +  "" minutes ago"" ||.                  diff &lt; 7200 &amp;&amp; ""1 hour ago"" ||.                  diff &lt; 86400 &amp;&amp; math.floor( diff / 3600 ) + "" hours ago"" ) ||.        day_diff == 1 &amp;&amp; ""yesterday"" ||.        day_diff &lt; 7 &amp;&amp; day_diff + "" days ago"" ||.        day_diff &lt; 31 &amp;&amp; math.ceil( day_diff / 7 ) + "" weeks ago"";"
