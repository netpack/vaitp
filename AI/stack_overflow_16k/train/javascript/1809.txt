"why does the browser returns undefined before the needed text? so the task is to use the provided string and create a new one, but using uppercase.here is my code:..let str = 'i am in the easycode';.let newstring;..for (let i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {.   newstring += str[i].touppercase();.}.console.log(newstring);...console shows 'undefinedi am in the easycode'.i am not sure why the undefines popped out and what to do to fix it...i believe this issue is related to the fact the newstring variable was defined in global score while i manipulating with that inside the loop...thank you in advance!"
