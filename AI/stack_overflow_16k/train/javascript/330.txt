"how to solve this? blank i have recently come across a website that has puzzles to solve using code. i am on problem one (sad right?) and alrighty got stuck. here is the puzzle: ...  if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. the sum of these multiples is 23....find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000...i am using this code:..var calculation = function(){..  var result = 0;.  var maxnumber = 1000;.  var resultstr = """";..  for(var i = 0; i &lt;= maxnumber; i++){.    if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0){.      result = result + i;.      resultstr = resultstr + i;.    }.  }.  alert(""your anwser is: "" + result);.  alert(""your anwser is: "" + resultstr.split(""""));.}..calculation();...*edit: i have changed my code to this to separate the digits, but my answer is still the same. ..var calculation = function(){..var result = 0;.var maxnumber = 1000;.var resultstr = """";..for(var i = 0; i &lt;= maxnumber; i++){.    if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0){.        result = result + i;.        resultstr = resultstr + ""-"" + i;.    }.}.alert(""your anwser is: "" + result);.alert(""your anwser is: "" + resultstr.split(""-""));...}..calculation();..explanation: a have a function named calculation that has three variables. inside the function there is a for loop that counts up from 0 to 1000 and checks every number to see if it is evenly divided by 3 or by 5. if it is then it is added to the resultstr variable a.k.a. result string that is more for debugging purposes. then it adds it to the result variable that houses the total sum of all the numbers that were evenly divisible by 3 and 5. then the program prints out the result variable a.k.a. the sum. only one problem... the program can't determine anything past a single digit. when i print out the sum, all i get is things like: 1 . so the sum isn't reliable. the output is 234168. i am kinda a noob at blank so anything will help! thanks!"
