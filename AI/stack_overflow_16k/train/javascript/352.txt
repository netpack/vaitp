"is it possible to measure the distance of the overflow scroll? the title refers to the scroll inertia found in most browsers when you scroll out of the document bounds...i would like to calculate span of the inertia, as in the max distance? more specifically, when the user scrolls to the top of page...if this is not possible, is it possible to just register a count of when this event happens? any help would be greatly appreciated."
