"is there an equivalent of the __nosuchmethod__ feature for properties, or a way to implement it in js? there is a nosuchmethod feature in some blank implementations (rhino, spidermonkey)..proxy = {.    __nosuchmethod__: function(methodname, args){.        return ""the "" + methodname + "" method isn't implemented yet. hint: i accept cash and beer bribes"" ;.    },..    realmethod: function(){.     return ""implemented"" ;   .    }.}..js&gt; proxy.realmethod().implemented.js&gt; proxy.newipod().the newipod method isn't implemented yet. hint: i accept cash and beer bribes.js&gt;...i was wondering, is there was a way to do something similar for properties? i'd like to write proxy classes that can dispatch on properties as well as methods."
