"how to take the string value out of its scope(unstring)? i have looked through string methods, but couldn't find any method to throw the string value out of its scope. is there any function to unstring the string in blank? .for instance if i receive a calculation in a string form from another file:..var five = 5.var three = 3.var calculation = five * three;.var string = 'calculation * 1232123 - five + three';...how can i store that received string in a variable where those values get out of string scope and get calculated? is there a way or is there a method to do so?"
