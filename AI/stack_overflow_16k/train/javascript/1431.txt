"multiple else if with indexof i have the following code:..var aaaa = exploded[1];..if (aaaa.indexof(""bbbb"")&gt;=0) { //do something here }...everything works great, but when i add:..else if (aaaa.indexof(""cccc"")&gt;=0) { //do something else }.else if (aaaa.indexof(""dddd"")&gt;=0) { //do something else 2 }.else if (aaaa.indexof(""eeee"")&gt;=0) { //do something else 3 }...i get a message ""aaaa is undefined"" and the code wont run. how can i fix this?..thanks..edit: commenting the curly braces was a mistake when i wrote here in stacoverflow, it has nothing to do with my issue. i solved my issue removing a lost curly brace inside the first else if. problem solved!"
