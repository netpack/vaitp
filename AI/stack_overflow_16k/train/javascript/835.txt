"is there a way to access object properties without referencing the object when provided as a function argument? assume you got an object like var obj = {a:'foo',b:'bar'} you provide to a function function equal(x) { return x.a === x.b}; .is there a way to provide the object argument as scope to remove the object references within the function like so function equal(x) { return a === b};?..side note: syntax preferably works with ecmascript 5th edition..rationale: the idea behind the question is to cover cases where the object argument holds many properties {a:'foo',b:'bar',...,z:'baz'}, which would require repeating the object name quiet often."
