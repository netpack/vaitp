"blank function body show the variable the same as the function variable i have a question,please see the code snippet,i can see it's invoked in some js libraries...can anyone tell me what's the excuting order of this snippet?  on my perspective, first ,the compiler declares a variable a.  when come to excuting time,it defines a function.and assigns it to variable a ,but in function body,the variable a can't reference anywhere since the 'var a' is still not been asigned to a funciton...i hope that i've expressed my quesion clearly...tell me where i am wrong...    var a= function(){reutrn a;}.    console.log(a()()().....)    /*no mater how many '()'s,it still returns the ""function (){return a }"" */"
