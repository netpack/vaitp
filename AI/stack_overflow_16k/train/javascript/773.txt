"simple blank does not work as intended why it is not alert the ""window is loaded"" message... it does successfully the window.location but after nothing...maybe the problem is that i cannot have document ready and window.load on the same function?..$(document).ready(function() {.    $('.dropdownblong').click(function(e){.        e.preventdefault();.        window.location = ""index.php?s=wiki_exp"";.        $(window).load(function() {.            alert(""window is loaded"");.            $("".ss"").slidetoggle(2500);.        });.    });.});"
