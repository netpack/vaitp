"are loops considered ""operators""? at a blank tutorial website that everyone knows and some use as a reference, it is stated that conditionals are considered ""operators"".  another person here at stackoverflow also confirmed this for me a while back.  ..loops kind of behave similar to conditionals in that they are not ""objects"" and that they run blocks of code with a twist, and i've been wondering if loops, like the for loop and the while loop and do while loop are considered ""operators"" or if they are just considered ""loops"", something categorically independent...i tried looking here, in various manuals and tutorial sites and found no information, sorry if this is a base question."
