"blank converting and exploding string to number hey guys what can i use to convert this string into a number?  ""$148,326.00""..i'm guessing that i need to explode it and take the dollar sign off, and then use parsefloat()?  would that be the wisest way ?  thanks..this is how im getting the number:..var homestead = xmldoc.getelementsbytagname(""sc2cash"");.document.getelementbyid('num1').innerhtml = homestead[1].textcontent;"
