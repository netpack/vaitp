"setting focus to an input after changing display to ""block"" i cant find the answer to this within a search...using blank i have a div (ac) with an onclick event part of which is to set focus to an input element (gn) within a previously hidden div (as)...i would expect this to work:..ac.onmousedown = function () {.    csect.style.display = ""none"";.    as.style.display = ""block"";.    gn.focus();.}...but didn't, so i added small delay..ac.onmousedown = function () {.    csect.style.display = ""none"";.    as.style.display = ""block"";.    settimeout(function(){.        gn.focus().        },30);.}...which made it work. ..is this delay really necessary? have i missed something?..thanks for any help."
