"blank only works on fresh load of webpage i'm creating a chrome extension. it's a theme for a website and i'm making changes with css but also blank..the blank part simply exchanges a broken link with the working one and gives it another text. the code works on a fresh load of the page, but if i navigate to any other part of the site, it doesn't work anymore. it only starts working again when i reload, or upon opening a link in a new tab...how can i change the code so it runs even after navigating to other parts of the site within the same tab?..var bookmarks = document.queryselector("".class li:nth-of-type(n) a"");.bookmarks.innerhtml = ""bookmarked"";.bookmarks.href = ""/user/bookmarks"";...the queryselector stays the same after navigating, i tested it with css. i tried this next --..var bookmarks = document.queryselector("".class li:nth-of-type(n) a"");.window.onload = function() {.    bookmarks.innerhtml = ""bookmarked"";.    bookmarks.href = ""/user/bookmarks"";.};...but to no avail. i'm really at a loss here as to what is going wrong."
