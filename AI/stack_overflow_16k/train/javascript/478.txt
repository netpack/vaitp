"blank's ternary operator semantic i'm trying to dive into the src code of jquery, and at the very beginning of the the src code in the development version(3.2.1) of jquery we find:..( function( global, factory ) {.""use strict"";.if ( typeof module === ""object"" &amp;&amp; typeof module.exports === ""object"" ) {.    module.exports = global.document ?.        factory( global, true ) :.        function( w ) {.            if ( !w.document ) {.                throw new error( ""jquery requires a window with a document"" );.            }.            return factory( w );.        };.} else {.    factory( global );.}...as far as my knowledge is concerned, i know that ternary operator comes after some condition, but here it comes after an assignment operator module.exports = global.document ?. could you explain this? what it does in the context of the previous code?"
