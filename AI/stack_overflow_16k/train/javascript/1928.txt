"blank adding multiple images using jspdf the first canvas is repeated i am using chart.js to produce some graphs and jspdf.js to produce a report containing images of the graphs and outputting as a pdf. i loop through the canvas's containing the graphs and add to the pdf doc but it is simply repeating the same chart on each graph...i have a button with an onclick call this function..function exporttopdf() {..  var doc = new jspdf();..  var canvases = document.getelementsbyclassname(""canvas"");..  for (var i = 0; i &lt; canvases.length; i++) {..    var currentcanvas = canvases[i];.    var url_base64jp = currentcanvas.todataurl(""image/jpg"");.    doc.addimage(url_base64jp, 'png', 15, 40, 180, 160, '', 'fast');.    doc.addpage();.  }..  doc.save('output.pdf').}...when i browse the pdf the first chart is repeated many times. if i change line..doc.addimage(url_base64jp, 'png', 15, 40, 180, 160,'','fast');...to..doc.addimage(url_base64jp, 'png', 15, 40, 180, 160);...it works but the pdf created is 100mb+ as opposed to ~100kb i think the additional processing required to add the large image slows it down so the base64 image generation is done by the time the next addimage is met. i think this is probably to do with callbacks and asynchronous processing but i cant get my head round it. can anyone help me with this?"
