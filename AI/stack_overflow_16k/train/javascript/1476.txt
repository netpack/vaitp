"blank multiline dict declaration i'm having an issue. i want to have a static dict..var mydict={""aaa"":true,""aab"":false,""aac"":false,""aad"":true, [...] };...there are a lot of entries, and i want to have an easy access to all of them in case i need to change their value. because of this, i don't like the single-line declaration. ..as an alternative, i did manage to do the following, since multi-line text is allowed in blank:..var dict = {};.var loaddict = function() {..    text = ""aaa,truen.aab,falsen.aac,falsen.aad,truen[...]"";..    var words = text.split( ""n"" );.    for ( var i = 0; i &lt; words.length; i++ ) {.        var pair = words[i].split("","");.        dict[ pair[0].trim() ] = pair[1].trim();.    }   .}...is there a better/more elegant way of having a multi-line declaration of a dict?..note: creating multiline strings in blank is a solution only for strings. it doesn't work with a dict...edit: i was adding a '' at the end of each line. that was the issue. thanks."
