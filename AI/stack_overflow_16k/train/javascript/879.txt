"blank. alert when sound plays i am basically trying to make a auto better on earn.gg (dice)..is there a way to alert(""win"") if a sound is playing in the chrome tab? i will run the script in the console of that tab...i have tried to do ""roll();"" in the console and it rolled the dice and returned me ""value:false"" because i lost and when i win it returns me value:true.so i figured to use that and make the code below. that simply didn't work and returned me ""win"" every time. screenshot: http://prntscr.com/fpeoxb..roll();.if(value=true){.   console.log(""win"");.}else if(value=false){.   console.log(""lose"");.}"
