"changing html based on blank i have an invasion-power forum, and i'm trying to use blank to change specific accounts profiles, but i can't seem to change the background. right now on the background picker it shows this..&lt;span id='customprofile' data-backgroundclass='ipsfocus_bg1' style='background-color: {theme=""ifbg1_hex""}; {{if theme.ifbg1_image}}background-image: url({theme=""ifbg1_image""});{{endif}} background-position: {theme=""ifbg1_position""}; background-size: {theme=""ifbg1_size""}'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...for one of the background options, but what i want to be able to do is have a script that if, say the url includes ""1"" than a different span is shown rather than this"
