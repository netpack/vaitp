setting a tables width in blank has a different value when logging in than page refresh our web application as a lot of blank so i cant upload all the code but i'm.wondering if someone.might have an idea on my problem. i'm just looking for possible causes so i can.investigate it...when i login i am taken to a page with several components on it. one of the.components is a table and sets its width based on what the parents width is. the.parents width is 100%. the child get the parent width in pixels..at the time the parent has a width of 250px so my table is set to 250px. when.the page is rendered the parent with is set to 600px. i'm not sure when it does.this but the child isn't updated...what is puzzling me is that when i refresh the child can get the correct width.of 600px from the parent...what is the difference between logging in and a page refresh?..it works fine on firefox but not chrome.
