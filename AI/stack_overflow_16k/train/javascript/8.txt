"function parameters in blank this is simple blank question..i have a function that takes two parameters:..function myfunction(par1, par2) {..    //part one.    //this will get executed always..    //lots of logic here..    if (!par2) {...        //part two.        //this will not get executed if false is passed as a second argument.        //more logic here..    }..}...in that function i have if, and its execution depends on par2 (which is bool)..that function is called many times in the code from other places, and when its called, both parts are executed. that is intended. now, i need to use the same function, but i need only part one executed. so i figured to add second parameter as bool type. and it works...so for example, calling function like: myfunction (par1) will execute both parts. but, if i i call it like myfunction (par1, true) it will execute only part 1...that works...i know that blank is not doing parameter checking, and i end up with undefined as a second parameter in certain occasions...my question is this normal practice?"
