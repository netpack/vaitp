"issue in making part of input box uneditable in blank i am making a terminal command prompt (the user can write on input-box and press enter and recieves the command from backend). ..i am passing a default value from model to my template for my input-box. this default value is a response that is fetched from backend and every time it changes (like different usernames and it is in form of ""name $>"" ) but i want to lock it before $ so user cannot go back and write before that, that is what i have tried:..var textvalue = this.model.get(""name"") + "" $&gt; "";.var textstring = string(textvalue); .var textstringlength = textstring.length;.$(""#textinput"").on(""change keyup keypress keydown"", function(evt) {     .    if($(""#textinput"").val().length &lt; textstringlength) {.       $(""#textinput"").val(textvalue); .    } .}); ...but i still can edit it! surprisingly it only works for backspace (which means i can not delete it by backspace) but if i use arrow keys or put the mouse cursor in between i still can edit! any idea?..that is my inputbox: &lt;input type=""text"" id=""textinput"" name="""" style=""background: #222; autofocus&gt; .any idea? with span as another solution?"
