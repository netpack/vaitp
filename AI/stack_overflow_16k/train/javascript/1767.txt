"how can i dynamically change onmouseover, onmouseout and onclick with parameters? i have an image:..&lt;img id=""reqpic"" src=""mark.png"" /&gt;...i also have declared a flag earlier on in the page:..&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;. var istooltipenabled = true;.&lt;/script&gt;...i now want to be able to check the flag and if its true, assign the onmouseover and onmouseout events. however, the onmousover event has to be changed to another function called tip('string') which takes in a string. i have seen other questions on here on how to change this but it i dont see how i can pass paramters to the new function i want to change to. ..the onclick would be changed to something like this:..onclick=""blank:togglehelp('reftypehelp');"";..any help on this would be greatly appreciated...thanks!"
