blank get text from an external webpage i have looked for a long time but i haven't been able to find a simple solution. on my webpage i want to input an address which will be looked up by a website which returns a webpage where in the text the username i need is located...https://id.ripple.com/v1/user/  +   the username inputed. it would open the page like https://id.ripple.com/v1/user/rukuchfyfvjucgtgdtsv2avqczmjrktkvw where there will be a username parameter containing sashadkiselev. i want to be able to make a function which takes the address opens that webpage retrieves the username and shows it in a pop up box.
