"alf.nu random4 excercise, what is the answer? i was playing on this site, and i got stuck at the random4 problem...so, basically, the problem is the following...var random4 = new function() {.  var rand = math.random();..  this.test = function(x) {.    return rand === x;.  }.};...what value of x should be passed to random4.test in order to have it return true?..note that the code here is slightly different from the linked page. this is because we do not have access to the rand variable and i want to make this explicitly clear."
