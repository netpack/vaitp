"blank determine if such object property exists based on a string we have a module that allows users to create some scripts...i would like to determine if user has used correct properties etc...for example user has wrote:..var test = session;...i can do:..var something = eval(""session"");.if (!something){.    // throw error here.}...but i'm facing issues with this:..var test = session.id; // session id property is ""id123456""...i thought i can do:..var something = eval(""session.id"");.if (!something){.    // throw error here.}...but it seems it really does this:..var something = eval(""id123456"");...any suggestions how can i determine wheter property exist in this object, also property in property and further?..as i said, i'm not trying to determine some certain object for some certain property, the strcture can be:..session.id.tostring().name ... and further..in addition, i have just tried this:..session.hasownproperty(""id""); // returned false..session.id // returned ""id123456"""
