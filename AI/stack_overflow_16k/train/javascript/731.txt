"is there any easier or shorter way to write this repeat code? i was wondering if there is any shorter/ easier way to write a repeating code. if the name entered into the prompt box doesn't have anything then it would send an error message and reput it...just so i dont have to explain alot, heres the code:..function error() {.    alert('you must enter a name.');.}..var name = prompt('what is your name?', 'name');..function repeat() {.    var name = prompt('what is your name?', 'name');.    if(name === '') {.        error();.        repeat();.    }.}..if(name === '') {.    error();.    repeat();.}"
