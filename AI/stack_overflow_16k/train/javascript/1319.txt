"using text as formula and replacing variables i have a formula that's stored as text.  i get this value from a div, but for the purpose of this question i will simply assign the value manually...price_formula = ""100.00 + (pages-24)/4 * 25.00""...now my aim is to replace pages with a numeric value and then do the math on this formula and output the result...here's what i've tried:..price_formula = ""150.00 + (pages-24)/2 * 30.00"";.price_formula = price_formula.replace('pages', 32);.alert(price_formula); // outputs ""150.00 + (32-24)/2 * 30.00)"".alert(math.floor(price_formula)); // outputs ""nan""...how can i use the price_formula string as an actual formula?"
