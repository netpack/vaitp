"for (var i in yourobjects) { ... } and .hasownproperty() ... discussion var yourobjects = [ ..{ object: {obj1:""aa""}, direction: 'top' },.{ object: ""obj2"", direction: 'left' }, .{ object: ""obj3"", direction: 'bottom' }..]; ..for (var i in yourobjects) { alert(i); }...there was a long discussion about that. .using for in to iterate an object returns all properties and methods of the object, so normally .hasownproperty() method should be used. but when we iterate an array, in fact for in iterates the indexes of the array (or keys if it is an associative array). i tried it in all browsers i have. but when tried in jsfiddle  ... it wasn't the same ... returned all methods which an array have. ..so my questin is: is it safe to use for in to iterate an array?   ..try this code in your browser and in jsfiddle, and tell me what do you think."
