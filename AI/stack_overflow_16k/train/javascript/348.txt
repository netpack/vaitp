"open explorer window from website, on mounted drives, including blank in the link reference to generate the path in addition to the question here:.open explorer window from website..i'm also having trouble with this, especially because i need to integrate a function into the link that eventually will open in file explore...bacially, we have a very simple intranet webpage, to control our cases etc...each case has some files in in a folder on the server, but to avoid to many subfolders in one folder, we split them in groubs of 200!..ipfileservercases""split-folder""subfolder..i what to open the folder clicking on the case on our webpage...the split-folder..is defined in ranges with case-numbers for evey 200 cases (sager in danish)..like this..25000-2519925001..25200-2539925399..25400-2559925422 or 25555 etc . ...the math to calculate the ""split-folder"" is simple enough with a script but getting this into a link that will open file explore is not that easy...&lt;!doctype html&gt;.&lt;html&gt;.&lt;body&gt;..&lt;button onclick=""myfunction(25555)""&gt;try it&lt;/button&gt;..&lt;p id=""sagslink""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;..&lt;script&gt;.function myfunction(sagnr) {.  var a = math.floor(sagnr/200)*200.  var b = math.floor(a+199);..  var x = ""file://///192.168.15.133/filserver2016/sager/"" + a + '-' + b + ""/""+sagnr;.  document.getelementbyid(""sagslink"").innerhtml = x;.}.&lt;/script&gt;...simple link that works in ie..but not in firefox og chrome...&lt;a href=""file://///192.168.1.133fileserver2016sager""&gt;sager-full-path&lt;/a&gt;...but i can not generate a useful link merging the to!..i have tried evey possible way described here to no awail:..blank function in href vs. onclick..perhaps i need to revice the function to give the actual link in sted. i also don't what a button but just a generat case-number...that serves as link!..further more! we mount  \192.168.1.133fileserver2016 as z:..so for our various programs, that use the z drive path, i would like to open file-explore with the mount path and not the ablosoute path...we can use ie if nessarry..but i would like i to work on firefox and chrome also..can this be done!"
