how to add 1 to a big number in blank ? i am just trying to add 1 to a big number if some conditions are met. here is my blank:..console.log('n1-&gt;'+n1+ ' - ' + typeof(n1) );.console.log('n2-&gt;'+n2);..if(n1 != null &amp;&amp; n2 != n1){.    console.log('adding 1');.    n2 = n1 + 1;.}.console.log('n2-&gt;'+n2);...and here is the console output:..n1-&gt;443751754287812600 - number.n2-&gt;null.adding 1.n2-&gt;443751754287812600...i was expecting having n2=443751754287812601 or even n2=4437517542878126001. can you explain why it is not working? and how to do the sum correctly?..thanks for your help.
