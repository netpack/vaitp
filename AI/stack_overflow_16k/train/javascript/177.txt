"animation alternatives blank so i want to make a small blank game..and in order to do that i need to animate a few things..i went researching and found about setinterval and requestanimationframe...i can use either of those 2 for making my game work, however i understood that requestanimationframe is the better alternative there..the problem i see with this is that while the function has its benefits , you are unable to set a framerate , or an update rate for it easily. ..i found another thread that explained a way of making this work however it seemed somewhat complicated....  controlling fps with requestanimationframe?...is there an easier way of animating with a set framerate  ?"
