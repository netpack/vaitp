"can anyone explain what the statement ""parent = parent || document;"" , not sure what it is trying to achieve? the following jewel.dom module has a few functions for manipulating css classes. the module also exposes $() function, which is just a wrapper for the queryselectorall() function. the $() function lets you use css selectors to easily select dom elements, similar to the $() function in jquery...jewel.dom = (function() {.    function $(path, parent) {.        parent = parent || document;.        return parent.queryselectorall(path);.    } .    return { $: $};.})();"
