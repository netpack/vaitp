"i can't access my list(observable collection) from another class i'm trying to do a filtering using radio buttons and delegates. basically i want to have a hard-coded list that would act like a pseudo database and then only display some items from the list depending on which button is pressed...i have an apartment.cs class that has a name and id property and nothing else...another class i have is apts.cs:..public  class apts.{.    private observablecollection&lt;apartment&gt; apartments;.    public observablecollection&lt;apartment&gt; apartments { get; set; }...    public apts().    {.        apartments = new observablecollection&lt;apartment&gt;().        {.            new apartment() {name = ""name1"", id = 1},.            new apartment() {name = ""name2"", id = 2},.            new apartment() {name = ""name3"", id = 3},.        };.    }.}...i am trying to access the apartments property which should be the list(am i wrong?) and pass it as a parameter to a listparis(observablecollection&lt;apartment&gt;) method i wrote. this code is in mainpage.xaml.cs..public void assigndelegates().{.    if (parisbutton.ispressed).    {.        myfunc = delactions.listparis(apartments);.    }.}...but i get an error saying:..cs0103  the name 'apartments' does not exist in the current context ...why can't i access the list?"
