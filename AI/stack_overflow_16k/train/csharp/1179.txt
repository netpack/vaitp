"safely catch api crashing/exiting i am using a third party electrical solver into my blank program trough its api...my problem is that the third party software sometimes closes when the network license is unavailable...the program tech support say that this is because an exit signal is sent when the license is unavailable...right now, when the third party software closes, my program closes as well. is there any way to avoid this?..a sample code would be this:..public class pf_interface {..    wapi apiinstance;..    public void createapi() {.        apiinstance = wapi.wcreateapiinstance();.    }.}...if the program is unavailable the line apiinstance = wapi.wcreateapiinstance(); will not return anything, and the execution goes no further...i would like to run the api independently from my program somehow, so when it closes, my program remains running."
