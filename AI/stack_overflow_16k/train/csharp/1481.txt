calling a method with generic signature and parameter i have the following signature which has a generic type and parameter as below:..list&lt;t&gt; getmylist&lt;t&gt;(t filter);...the filter type is different from the list type. i am trying to call like this:..var mylist = repo.getmylist&lt;list&lt;items&gt;&gt;(filter);...i am not sure how to specify the type of 'filter' in the method call. is this possible?
