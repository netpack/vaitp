"match string version of object element to object element itself i'm having an instance where i have an object that looks similar to this:..public class answerobject.{.    public string q1 { get; set; }.    public string q2 { get; set; }.    public string q3 { get; set; }.    public string q4 { get; set; }.    public string q5 { get; set; }.    ....    public string q80 { get; set; }.}...the questions themselves look like this:..public class questionobject.{.    public string datamember { get; set; }.    ....}...the datamember string carries a string version of the answer object element.  so, if i have question 1 have a datamember of ""q1"" then i want it to fill in answerobject.q1 and so on.  right now i have a lengthy switch statement to solve this, but there has to be a more efficient way to do this.  ..switch(datamember) {.    case ""q1"":.        answerobject.q1 = answervalue;.        break;.    case ""q2"":.        answerobject.q2 = answervalue;.        break;.    .....};...i've researched for a few hours and didn't come up with anything.  any help is much appreciated."
