"trying to draw a function i'm trying to draw a graph in blank, something like ..so far i've been able to draw simple lines using the drawline, but that is very limitative of its own, because, not only i'm forced to provide the start and end points, i'm also limited to straight lines...and as you can see ....i have a curve at the very last trech of the expression (a inverted parabola)..any hints on how to perform this in a bmp drawing?..i've been drawing using the following..   using (graphics g = graphics.fromimage(bmp)).           { //g.drawline and others.}"
