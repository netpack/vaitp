"why can i assign 0.0 to enumeration values, but not 1.0 just out of curiosity: why can i assign 0.0 to a variable that is of an enumeration type, but not 1.0? have a look at the following code:..public enum foo.{.    bar,.    baz.}..class program.{.    static void main().    {.        foo value1 = 0.0;.        foo value2 = 1.0;   // this line does not compile.        foo value3 = 4.2;   // this line does not compile.    }.}...i thought that conversions between numerical types and enumeration values are only allowed via casts? that is i could write foo value2 = (foo) 1.0; so that line 2 in main can compile. why is there an exception for the value 0.0 in blank?"
