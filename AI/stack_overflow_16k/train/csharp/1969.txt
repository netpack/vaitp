"what is the ideal structure for handling nonce? i would like to keep track of a .... of nonces. it should track the nonce value and the expiration date. the structure should allow for fast lookup of the nonce, like a dictionary, but allow for reasonably efficient cleanup, e.g., pop the expired nonces and stop when you no longer need to pop them. what do you recommend? expiration hacks (e.g., a limited size rotating buffer) are good too."
