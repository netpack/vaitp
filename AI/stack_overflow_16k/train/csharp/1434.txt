"reassign value of variable i'm using blank and reading a line of text (ln) and assigning an image to a picture box.  after the image is selected, i check to see if it's night or day and attempt to change the selected image to the night version if the sun has gone done...        charpos = ln.indexof(""partly cloudy"", 0);.        if (charpos &gt; -1).        {.            skyimg = ""sct.jpg"";.            skymsg = ""partly cloudy"";.            if (ampm = ""p"") skyimg = ""nsct.jpg"";.        }...the compiler tells me i'm missing a semi-colon and just doesn't like that second ""if"" check..do i have to use an ""else if"" and include both possible conditions in each check?"
