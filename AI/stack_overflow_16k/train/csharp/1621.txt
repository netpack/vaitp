"can't access property inside object initializer consider the following code. ..list&lt;myfiles&gt; files = new list&lt;myfiles&gt;();......while (reader.read()).{.    var a = new myfiles.    {.       filename = reader[""filename""].tostring(),.       filelocation = reader[""filelocation""].tostring(),.       fullpath = filelocation + @"""" + filename // error at this line.    };.   files.add(a);.}...the above is a snippet from my method which uses sqldatareader to fetch data from the database. everything works fine expect when i try to assign value to fullpath property i get the following error message:...  an object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property 'myfiles.filelocation'.  an object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property 'myfiles.filename' ...i know i can make those properties static or create an instance and access them via e.g. var b = new myfiles(); b.filelocation .. ..but my question is why can't i use filelocation and filename as i am in the above code snippet. is there something i'm missing?"
