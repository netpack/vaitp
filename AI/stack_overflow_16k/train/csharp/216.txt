"static keyword when creating instance i came across the following code. ..public class test.{.  public static test create() .  {.    return new test .    {.     a1 =1,.     b1=""abc""     ..    };.  }.  :.  :.  :.}...and in the calling class it is instantiated as below..static test model = test.create();...what is the use of static keyword in the above line? what will be the difference if we don't use the static keyword? i'm using .net 4 and vs 2010..edit..i know what is static in blank. the main reason i asked this question is why is it used when creating instance of class?"
