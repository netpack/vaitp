"how to add items to a property of type list when instantiating an object with object initializer? i want the books not to be null so i made it an initialized readonly property as follows...class author.{.    public int id { get; set; }.    public string name { get; set; }.    public list&lt;string&gt; books { get; } = new list&lt;string&gt;();.}...because of this constraint, i have to instantiate an object a first with object initializer and then populate its books property via addrange as follows...class project.{.    void main().    {.        author a = new author.        {.            id = 100,.            name = ""bill gates"".        };.        a.books.addrange(new string[] { ""asp.net"", ""c++"", ""blank"" });.    }.}...question..is there any trick to make the instantiation of a (as well as populating its books) simpler just with object initializer?"
