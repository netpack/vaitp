"replace nuget package with a local dll file a project i am working on depends on a nuget package. the dll file inside package is compiled in release mode, therefore using debugger to inspect code (which is my goal) is impossible. ..i'd like to replace the .dll file with the one i compiled in debug mode. if i remove the package via nuget and then add it via add reference, i get error:..assembly 'assemblyname' with identity 'assemblyname, version=4.2.5.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=null' uses 'system.memory, version=4.0.1.1, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=cf7b13ffcb2dde54' .which has a higher version than referenced assembly 'system.memory' with identity 'system.memory, version=4.0.1.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=cf7b13ffcb2dde54'...what is the correct way to replace a nuget package .dll with another .dll file? where can the version number be changed i am using rider, but learning how to do it in other ides is also useful."
