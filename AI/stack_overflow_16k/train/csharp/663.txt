"filling listview & imagelist selected item confusion blank i new to programming and blank and seemed to have worked myself into a bit muddle with the above..what i am trying to do is create a front end for the living room media pc nothing to fancy to start with as i understand this is a mamoth task for a total noobie like me..ive flapped about and am totally fine with launching external exe's,storing/loading resouces ect.. and been very happy with my results for my 2 week surfing...so im starting off my project by just launching an emulator to start with and what i would like to do is scan a folder for zip files and image files and if it finds matching image and zip files it displays an image in a list view for each zip found...so i populate my listboxes like this and get my 2 listboxes showing the stuff i want to see...populatelistbox(listbox1, ""\somepath\"", ""*.zip"");.populatelistbox(listbox2, ""\images\"", ""*.jpg"");..private void populatelistbox(listbox lsb, string folder, string filetype).    {.        directoryinfo dinfo = new directoryinfo(folder);.        fileinfo[] files = dinfo.getfiles(filetype);.        foreach (fileinfo file in files).        {.            lsb.items.add(file.name);.        }.    }...so i now have my 2 listboxes and can see i have game1.zip and game1.jpg, great now i can populate my listview with the game1 image and launch the emulator he say's simple...this is how i am currently populating the listview... populatelistview();. private void populatelistview(). {.  if (listbox1.items.contains(""game1.zip"")). {.   if (file.exists(""\images\game1.jpg"")).    {.     imagelist1.images.add(image.fromfile(""\images\game1.jpg""));.     listview1.items.add("""", 0);.    }. }.. if (listbox1.items.contains(""game2.zip"")). {.   if (file.exists(""\images\game2.jpg"")).    {.     imagelist1.images.add(image.fromfile(""\images\game2.jpg""));.     listview1.items.add("""", 1);.    }. }.}...this is how i am currently launching and it works ok... // launch item. private void listview1_mousedoubleclick(object sender, mouseeventargs e). {.   if (listview1.items[0].selected == true).    {.      string rom = ""\"" + listbox1.items[0].tostring();.      // launch code in here.    }..    if (listview1.items[1].selected == true).     {.       string rom = ""\"" + listbox1.items[1].tostring();.       // launch code in here.     }.    }...so what the problem you may ask ?.instead of keep typing in all that info for each item i want to use some kind of statment if possible and i dont know what to search for which does not help..the image name will allways match the zip name just need to loose the file extensions so to populate the listview somthing like this...if (listbox1 item = listbox2 item). {.  add to imagelist and listview automaticly with same index. } ...then i want to be able to launch just using somthing like this... private void listview1_mousedoubleclick(object sender, mouseeventargs e). {.      string rom = ""\"" + listview.selected.item.tostring;.      // launch code in here. }...hope im making sense im at my witts end...regards..derek"
