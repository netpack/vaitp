"passing data from a 32-bit app to a 64 bit app? my company sells a data visualization tool.  right not we do this with a 32-bit blank application (even though most of our clients have moved to 64-bit hardware) because it is almost impossible to get use the 64-bit access drivers.  ..we would like to take advantage of a 64-bit application, but we don't want to put our clients through the pain of trying to getting connected to access in a pure 64-bit environment...so we had an idea.  what if we had a 32-bit background application running in the background that was responsible for pulling data out of access.  this application would then pass the data to our main 64-bit application...the thing we cannot sort out is how to pass the retrieved data from the 32-bit app to the 64-bit app...anybody got ideas of how to do this or have another approach we can take?"
