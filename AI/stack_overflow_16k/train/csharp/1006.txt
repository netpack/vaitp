"define ""custom"" integer-based type? i have a program that is interfacing with an external library that, among other things, has an unsigned 12-bit value packed in a larger struct...this used to be 8 bits, so we simply marshaled it as a byte...now that it's 12 bits... i can use a ushort, but that opens up issues of (a) range checking and (b) marshaling...is there a simple way of implementing a constrained numeric type like this, where i don't have to override every assignment and comparison method?"
