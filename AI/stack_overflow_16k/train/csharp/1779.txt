"mailbox unavailable in blank i am attempting to email myself through my program, using this method:..mailmessage email = new mailmessage(""it_request@creandsel.com.au"", ""ben.hall@creandsel.com.au"");.smtpclient client = new smtpclient();.client.port = 25;.client.deliverymethod = smtpdeliverymethod.network;.client.usedefaultcredentials = false;.client.host = ""hp132.hostpapa.com"";.email.subject = ""new it request"";.email.body = model.description;..client.send(email); // error catches here...however i am getting the error message: ...  mailbox unavailable. the server response was: access denied - invalid helo name (see rfc2821 4.1.1.1)...i have tried alternate hosts (creandsel.com.au), to the same effect. i believe it may be because i am sending this from an internal network to a third party email provider...also, not sure if this matters, but the sender (it_request@creandsel.com.au) does not exist."
