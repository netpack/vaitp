"trying to change color of label through an array which doesn't work? i'm trying to make a loop to check if certain files exist, and if they do they're going to change an indicator label on my form, but i can't seem to work out how to do this w/out typing out every single one manually such as this:..        if (file.exists(""c:\monitorfiles\bot-pc-8is1.txt"")).        {.            pc8is1.backcolor = color.green;.        }.        if (file.exists(""c:\monitorfiles\bot-pc-8is2.txt"")).        {.            pc8is2.backcolor = color.green;.        }.        if (file.exists(""c:\monitorfiles\bot-pc-8is3.txt"")).        {.            pc8is3.backcolor = color.green;.        }...i've tried several very basic ways of just building arrays and substituting but i can't put "" variablex.backcolor "", i've tried [variable].backcolor, no dice...this is a hard one to search for on google, and hopefully has an easy answer!..thanks"
