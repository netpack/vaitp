"generating not only unique password letters i have a problem with my password generator. ..    var listofcharacters = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"".    chars = listofcharacters.tochararray();.} // rb: i've reformatted the code, but left this brace in. .  //     i think it should be removed though... ..string password = string.empty;.for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) // length = 64.{.    int x = random.next(0, chars.length); // chars.lenght = 26 ..    if (!password.contains(chars.getvalue(x).tostring())).        password += chars.getvalue(x);.    else.        i--;. }.. if (length &lt; password.length) password = password.substring(0, length); //stucks here at 26 because all the 26 chars from the list are used one time so there are no more chars to use, but i want to use a char more than one time.. return password;...my problem is: when i want to create a password with 64 chars and i use a list of chars from by example 26 he stops generating at 26 because he only takes all the 26 chars from the list just 1 time. i need in my code above a method to take 1 chars more than one so not only each char just 1 time but by example he can takes the letter ""a"" 3 times."
