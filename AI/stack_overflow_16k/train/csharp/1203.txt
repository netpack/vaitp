"assigning a priority to processes before they are launched i have a specific number of process(blank .exe)  that should be launched. how do i launch them according to their priority...i know the process.priorityclass thing but it's not really useful because it only assigns the priority after the process is launched...i have this code here (doesn't compares priority yet) but it doesn't work because the processes are not run so i can't assign the priority to them:..process process1 = new process();    .process process2 = new process();.process process3 = new process();..process1.startinfo.filename = ""proc1"";..process2.startinfo.filename = ""proc2""'..process3.startinfo.filename = ""proc3"";..process1.priorityclass = processpriorityclass.abovenormal;..process2.priorityclass = processpriorityclass.belownormal;..process3.priorityclass = processpriorityclass.high;..process2.start();..process2.waitforexit();..process1.start();..process1.waitforexit();..process3.start();"
