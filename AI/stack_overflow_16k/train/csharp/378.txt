how can i share a variable between two partial classes in two files? i have this code in one file:..namespace japanese.{.    public partial class phrasespage : contentpage.    {.        phrasesframe phrasesframe = new phrasesframe();...this code in another file:..namespace japanese.views.phrases.{.    public partial class phrasespage.    {.        public void settimeinterval().        {..        phrasesframe // can't access...i would like to be able to access phrasesframe in the second file but it seems not possible. can anyone give me suggestions on what i could do so i could access this in the other file which is also a partial class. one more question. should i inherit from contentpage in all of the files with my partial class or is just one file enough?
