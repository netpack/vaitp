"not sure where to ask, which 1 is actually better?        customer cust = new customer();.       cust.recid = lblrecid.text;.       cust.custcd = txtcustcd.text;.       cust.custname = txtcustname.text;.       cust.save();...or..cust.saverecord(lblrecid.text , txtcustcd.text, txtcustname.text)...both doing the same job, but which 1 is actually better? i and lead actually have an argue on this, i using the top method, as i can freely assign the value in any order, but he insist that the bottom 1 is better? no idea what actually to search, any 1 mind to give me some guideline on this"
