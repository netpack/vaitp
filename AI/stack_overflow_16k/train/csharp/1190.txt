"only write to log file if my log level is info or higher i have logging module in my code and it is used frequently. first argument of each logging method is always the log level, while other arguments represent formatted string and its parameters. parameters are very often calls to some other functions that calculates value of that parameter. e.g. when i want to print list, i use something like this:..logger.log(info, ""printed list is: "", string.join("", "", mylist));...what is the problem with this? string.join("", "", mylist) will first be evaluated, then log method will be invoked and inside here, based on current logging level, it will be decided if message will be logged into some file. if message won't be logged (current logging level is less than info), string.join("", "", mylist) is evaluated for nothing. ..is there any way (without huge manual changes) to invoke log call and evaluation of parameters only if current logging level is at least the one specified in method call?"
