"how to properly split a csv using blank split() function? suppose i have this csv file :..name,address,date.""eko s. wibowo"", ""tamanan, banguntapan, bantul, diy"", ""6/27/1979""...i would like like to store each token that enclosed using a double quotes to be in an array, is there a safe to do this instead of using the string split() function? currently i load up the file in a richtextbox, and then using its lines[] property, i do a loop for each lines[] element and doing this :..string[] line = s.split(',');...s is a reference to richtextbox.lines[]..and as you can clearly see, the comma inside a token can easily messed up split() function. so, instead of ended with three token as i want it, i ended with 6 tokens..any help will be appreciated!"
