"how would i set mouse cursor at x,y coordinates, click left mouse and scroll left,right,top,bottom as described in the title i've been trying to search for a way to set the mouse coordinates by using a cursor.position = new point(58, 128); then while holding the left mouse button (down) i'm trying to scroll to another direction(random direction). for example, if i was to go onto google earth and set the cursor position at 0,0 the cursor would then scroll around the map. if anyone can help out i would surely appreciate it...thanks..solution: floatas, thanks again  for responding to this post. i spent yesterday and today trying to figure this out and i finally got it working. i will post my code in hopes this helps others out."
