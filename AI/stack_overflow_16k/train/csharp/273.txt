"how to build a path (that contains spaces) that can be used by robocopy or other? i am using 2012 desktop express.  i am doing a conversion of several programs from vb.net to blank.  this problem is now holding up 3 of my projects.  i have did almost endless searches and have so many articles, but in none of them do the combine literal and variables together to create a new string...so i have tried the @ sign in numerous ways, path.combine and a few others.  every way either leaves me with no quotes in my string or with extra escape characters that robocopy spits out an error.  here is my most promising work:..i need: ""g:2016 dproberts""..string sbak_folder = """""" + sbak_drive + "":\"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yyyy"") + "" "" + environment.username + """""";...output: """"g:2016 dproberts""""..string sbak_folder = path.combine(sbak_drive + "":\"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yyyy"") + "" "" + environment.username);...output: g:2016 dproberts..string sbak_folder =(char)34 + sbak_drive + "":\"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yyyy"") + "" "" +  environment.username + (char)34;...output: """"g:2016 dproberts""""..thanks for the consideration,.:} dproberts..edit1:.thank you for your responses. i will try to add more detail.  here is my code for a label that is clicked:  this a direct translation from my vb code, so i may have messed up at that point...    // string sbak_folder = """""" + sbak_drive + "":\"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yyyy"") + "" ""  + environment.username + """""";.    // string sbak_folder = path.combine(sbak_drive + "":\"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yyyy"") + "" ""  + environment.username);.    string suser_folder = (char)34 + system.environment.getenvironmentvariable(""userprofile"") + (char)34;.    string sbak_folder = (char)34 + sbak_drive + "":\"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yyyy"") + "" ""  + environment.username + (char)34;.    directory.createdirectory(sbak_folder);.    process.start(""robocopy.exe"", suser_folder + "" "" + sbak_folder + "" /e /r:0 /w:0"");...each of the formats i listed above give me a invalid source folder from robocopy...so in order to debug the problem i created a batch file with 2 lines:..echo %1 ..pause..so when i run with each of the 3 examples i have tried:..    process.start(""d:\temp\bak.cmd"", sbak_folder);...i get the 3 outputs listed above, so my line of reasoning has been that it does not like the escape characters or the space, and these would be solved if i can find a way to send double quotes like i do in vb (i just put a chr(34) around each end) i have used the program for 50+ of users for about 4 years now...thank you,.:} dproberts"
