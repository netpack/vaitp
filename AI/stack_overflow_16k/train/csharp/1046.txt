"how to improve this algorithm for correcting the position of decimal for a stream of numbers how can i improve the below algorithm for the following problem? ...a stream of numbers is received. .at some point in the stream, numbers begin arriving which have the decimal point in the wrong place.after a period of time the error disappears and correct values enter the stream....how can i correct the numbers with the decimal point in the wrong place?..note that the incorrect numbers are not out by exactly a multiple of ten. here are example streams:..it can be assumed that numbers will always be greater than zero and that they differ by less than 50% from one value to the next...11.111.11.112.11.113.1111.4 // wrong.1111.5 // wrong.11.116.11.117...0.000011111.0.000011112.0.000011113.111.14       // wrong.111.15       // wrong.0.000011116.0.000011117...0.000011111.0.000011112.0.000011113.0.0011114   // wrong.0.0011115   // wrong.0.000011116.0.000011117...here's the code i would like to improve:..    static double lastvalue = -1;.    static void onvalue(double value) {.        if (value &lt;= 0).            return;.        if (lastvalue != -1) {.            var toohigh = lastvalue * 9.5;.            var toolow = lastvalue * 0.15;.            while (value &gt;= toohigh).                value /= 10;.            while (value &lt;= toolow).                value *= 10;.        }.        lastvalue = value;.        // process value.    }"
