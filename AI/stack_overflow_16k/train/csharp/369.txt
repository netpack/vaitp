"reset an auto-increment counter in object i have a class containing an auto-increment counter like this: ..class myclass.{.    private static object sync = new object();.    private static int globalcount;.    private int idunique;..    public myclass().    {.        lock(sync).        {.            idunique = ++globalcount; .        }.    }.}...the problem is, in my app, when the user deletes an instance of myclass, i'd like it to reset the counter and recalculate the counter for the remaining instances of myclass. ..for example:..myclass a has idunique of 1  .myclass b has idunique of 2  .myclass c has idunique of 3  .myclass d has idunique of 4...the user deletes b &amp; c so the app updates the remaining instances so a has a idunique of 1 and d has a idunique of 2."
