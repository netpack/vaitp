"how can i make this program work properly? let me start off by quickly summarizing what this program does. it's a really basic form of a clicker game(here: space/any button on your keyboard/). i have 2 buildings(manor and booster). manor makes gold based on its level, whilst booster boosts the amount of gold made per click(press)...however when i try to run the program itself i bump into a problem. basically(as it'll be visible on the code i'll copy-paste here) when i run the first function of the program(making gold) it'll produce and save the gold properly(your gold balance is x now), but when i try to upgrade my building/look at my balance it says: insufficient gold/0. ..i've tried printing out the steps seperately(without the while function) and it worked, i could even upgrade my building but then after that, it started to produce the gold weirdly(so instead of producing the amoung at level 2/press, it produced something else, once even a negative number came out as a result). ..now in the code below i don't have the full while function(i've tried to fix it and since i only needed the producing and one upgrading function for test purposes i didn't complete the function with 4 options(a)produce b) upgrade c)upgrade d)show balance) but only the first two.)..any help is appreciated and have a nice day!..using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;..namespace clicker_game.{.  class program.  {.    class buildings.    {.      // two buildings: manor, helper(multiplier) + gold balance // .      int manorlevel = 0;.      int boosterlevel = 0;.      int goldbalance = 0;..      // level cost of the buildings and their properties.      // on each level index - 1 = level's bonus // .      int[] mproduce = new int[10] { 1, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 };.      int[] mlevelcost = new int[9] { 5, 30, 45, 60, 90, 115, 130, 200, 400 };.      int[] bvalue = new int[10] { 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6 };.      int[] blevelcost = new int[9] { 5, 30, 45, 60, 90, 115, 130, 200, 400 };..      public int manorupgrader().      {.        console.writeline(""do you really wanna upgrade your manor from "" + manorlevel + .
