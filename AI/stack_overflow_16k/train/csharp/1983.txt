"proper methodology for abstracting smaller class from larger class in blank i have a class, projections, which maps to a table of the same name, which has 14 properties(columns). most of the time i only need 5 of those properties. what is the proper way to create a smaller class that only inherits the properties i need in blank. i'm a vb guy who is trying to migrate to blank and can't seem to find exactly what i am trying to do online."
