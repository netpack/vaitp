"can't remove a specific completed task from a list here is my code:..private static async task concurrenttest().{.    list&lt;task&gt; subtasks = new list&lt;task&gt;() { subtask() };.    while (subtasks.count &gt; 0).    {.        task nexttask = task.whenany(subtasks);.        await nexttask;.        subtasks.remove(nexttask);.        system.diagnostics.debug.writeline(""subtasks count ""+subtasks.count.tostring());.    }.}..private static async task subtask().{.    int i = 0;.    while (!canceltokensource.token.iscancellationrequested).    {.        system.diagnostics.debug.writeline(""test delay..."");.        await task.delay(1000);.        if(i &gt; 3).        canceltokensource.cancel();.        ++i;.    }.    return;.}..static cancellationtokensource canceltokensource = new cancellationtokensource();..subtasks.remove(nexttask) can't remove the completed task....i know that there is ..subtasks.removeall(x=&gt;x.iscompleted);...but i don't want to remove all the tasks that are completed at the instance of removeall because i need to retrieve the results one by one..furthermore, i have looked at this article on msdn. ..basically, it uses the same method. ..wonder why mine doesn't work...edit oh my.. suddenly realized how stupid the mistake i have made!!.just add an await like this would work.....task nexttask = await task.whenany(subtasks);...but thank you guys anyways."
