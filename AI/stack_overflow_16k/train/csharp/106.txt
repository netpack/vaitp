"creating one datatable from two i have two datatables with identical schemas, business partners and addresses. i'm trying to combine them in a specific format in order to import into another system...basically, i want the output to be as follows:...business partner.all associated addresses.next business partner.all associated addresses...here is the latest code i'm trying:..            var finaldt = bpdt.clone();..            foreach(datarow bprow in bpdt.rows).            {.                finaldt.importrow(bprow);..                foreach(datarow addressrow in addressdt.rows).                {.                    if(convert.tostring(bprow[""id""]).equals(convert.tostring(bprow[""id""]))).                    finaldt.importrow(addressrow);.                }.            }...it seems to get caught in a infinite loop but i don't understand why. is there a better way to approach this?"
