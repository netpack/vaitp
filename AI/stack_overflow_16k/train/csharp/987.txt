"create a generic list of generic objects in blank i have a generic class for which i would like to create a generic list,  where the underlying  classes implement the same interface. however, not all  implement the given interface...an example would be easier than describing the problem. ..internal interface isomething.{..}..internal class thisthing : isomething.{.}..internal class thatthing : isomething.{..}..internal class somethingelse .{..}..internal class genericthing&lt;t&gt; .{..}..internal class dothings.{.    void main().    {.        var thing1 = new genericthing&lt;thisthing&gt;();.        var thing2 = new genericthing&lt;thatthing&gt;();..        var thing3 = new genericthing&lt;somethingelse&gt;();..        **var thinglist = new list&lt;genericthing&lt;isomething&gt;&gt;() {thing1, thing2};**.    }...}..i'm unable to create the thinglist.  is there a way to cast the two things that implement the same interface into a generic collection, while still preserve the genericthing class not to be constrained to the interface."
