is it possible to combine two conditions i have these two conditions:..            if (someotherstuff &amp;&amp; keyboard.modifiers == modifierkeys.control).            {.                e.cancel = true;.            }..            if (someotherstuff &amp;&amp; keyboard.modifiers == (modifierkeys.control | modifierkeys.shift)).            {.                e.cancel = true;.            }...i was wondering if it is possible to combine these two if clauses to one? or the way i have it is correct? if they hold the control button and also if they hold the control and shift button
