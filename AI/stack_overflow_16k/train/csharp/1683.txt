"how to solve argument out of range exceptions so i've been looking around for quite a while to try and find a solution to this..i've been trying to make a card game and am stuck at a section in which i create a cad along with its properties. i decided to make it in the form of an array. the code looks like:..(not sure what happened with these first ones)..string[] dogs = system.io.file.readalllines(@""c:userscorindocumentsblank codingdogs.txt"");..int individual = totalcards / 2;..random r = new random();.int cards = totalcards / 2;..list&lt;list&lt;int&gt;&gt; playercards = new list&lt;list&lt;int&gt;&gt;(cards);..for (int x = 0; x &lt; (cards-2); x++).{.    playercards[0].add(int32.parse(dogs[x]));//cards.    playercards[1].add(r.next(1, 6));//drool.    playercards[2].add(r.next(1, 101));//exercise.    playercards[3].add(r.next(1, 11));//intelligence.    playercards[4].add(r.next(1, 11));//friendliness.}...no errors are raised before i run the code but when i try it an argument out of range exception occurs for the line: playercards[0].add(int32.parse(dogs[x]));.i tried removing it and the same error occured for the next line. i'm not sure what i've done wrong and have tried to find a solution for quite some time. if anyone has any tips or answers that would be great..thanks"
