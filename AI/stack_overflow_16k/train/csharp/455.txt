"how are if statements processed? i'm trying to optimize my code as much as possible and that, to me, means minimizing the amount of calculations performed. i have:..for (int i = 0; i &lt; this.entities.count; i++) .{.    if (this.entities[i].type == 2).    {.        if (this.entities[i].x &gt; this.bounds.width + this.sideoffset || this.entities[i].x &lt; -this.sideoffset).        {.            this.entities.remove(this.entities[i]);.        }.    }.}...and to optimize it i have nested the out of bounds check inside the type check so it is only ran when the check is ran. my question is, how are if statements processed in blank? is every condition checked regardless or could i put both if statements in one and have it effectively still run the same (if this.entities[i].type doesn't equal two it wouldn't run the rest of the if statement)"
