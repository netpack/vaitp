"blank how to create the following syntax method(param => { params.xxx })? in a code example i've seen the following code:..someclass.columns(columns =&gt; {.        columns.add().            .text(""product"").            .value(""123"");..        columns.add().            .text(""amount"").            .value(""456"");.})...now i was wondering what the requirements are to create this kind of structure..where columns is a collection of column objects and..text and .value are methods on the column object that return the object again (to create the fluent syntax)...the columns.add() would return a new column() object..what would be the parameter(s) in the method in the someclass.columns(???)?.does this syntax have a specific name that i can research?..thank you...edit:..yes there is fluent syntax in my example but that was not my question, sorry that i was not clear...the question is howi make to following:..someclass.columns(columns =&gt; { ... })...so how does the parameter in the method columns look?..thank you."
