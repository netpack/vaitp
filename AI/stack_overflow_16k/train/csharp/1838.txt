"why does vs crash as i try open a blank class in the editor (abstract inheritance issue?) i am reciving a strange error and it is causing vs to crash, to what i have managed to gather it is due to the fact that vs tries to instanciate the class (wich is inheriting an interface &amp; abstract class)i am about to open as to run the code in the backround and try my code i add or any changes. ..the icon is not as the regular class icon's in the solution explorer but it looks like the form icon instead, as soon as i remove the inheritance it goes into a regular class icon and i can dubble klick it and vs does not crash but instead opens the class in the editor...the classes:..namespace tester.{.   interface itest.   {..      string id { get; set; }..      double age { get; set; }        ...   }.}...the next one:..namespace tester.{.public abstract class trial : itest.{.    //declaring variables.    string m_id;.    double m_age;..    string id .    { .        get { return m_id; }.        set { m_id = value; }.    }..    double age .    {.        get { return m_age; }.        set { m_age = value; }.    }..}.}...next one is:.. namespace tester.{.public class time : trial.{.    //declaring variables.    private bool m_isfast;...    /// &lt;summary&gt;.    /// default constructor.    /// &lt;/summary&gt;.    public time().    {.    }..    public bool isfast.    {.        get { return m_isfast; }.        set { m_isfast = value; }.    }..}.}...last one is: ..  namespace tester.  {.  class banditone : time.  {.        //declaring variables.        private bool m_istransam;..        /// &lt;summary&gt;.        /// constructor.        /// &lt;/summary&gt;.        public banditone().        {.        }..        public bool istransam.        {.            get { return m_istransam; }.            set { m_istransam = value; }.        }...        new public string getracespecificdata().        {                .            string strout = (string.isnullorempty(strinfo) ? string.empty : strinfo);..            if (istransam).            {.                strout += string.format(""nproduces #1"");.            }.            if (isfast).            {.                strout += (isfast ? ""nfast as lightning! "" : ""nslow like a snail."");.            }.          return strout;..        }.        }...i hope someone got an idea as i am all out :/ is there something i have completely misunderstood or missed about abstract classes perhaps?"
