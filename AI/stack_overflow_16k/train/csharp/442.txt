"blank - how to detect mouse cursor movements when at the edge of the screen? i have a teacher that gave me the project idea of connecting 2 screens (seperate computers) together much like what a dual monitor setup works. the idea is to send the cursor position over to another computer (that would be the reciever) and when the sender computer's cursor hits the edge of the screen, it would move the other computer's cursor to the start of the screen (again, to mimic a dual monitor setup)...i've asked around and got some recomendations to calculate the velocity of my cursor and when it hits the edge send the expected output to the other computer but that wouldn't work when my cursor is at the edge, it has no velocity (to the direction of the edge)..as i said in the beggining, the results i want are simply for my program to be able to detect if my mouse is going (for example) right when i'm at the right edge of my screen ; anyone knows how to do this?"
