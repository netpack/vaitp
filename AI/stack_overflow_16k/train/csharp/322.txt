"callermembernameattribute and .net 4 all,..i noticed in .net 4.5 there is a callermembername attribute, which blend specifically uses to raise a propertychanged event from the calling method.  my question is, since this attribute doesn't specifically exist in .net 4.0, is it possible to somehow duplicate this behavior by creating a custom attribute?  code samples much appreciated."
