"blank enter mathematical problem and solve it when user enter ""="" i have some test. i need to do and i just can't understand how to do it...we are asked to make a program that will take the user input (numbers and operators) and will end to take inputs if the user enters ""="", then it will solve it.  ..example:.user input - 10+10+10+10= (will stop cuz he enterd = and calculate).will be like that 10+10+10+10=40..int sum;.int num;.char x;.string op;.console.writeline(""lets start sum some numbers!"");.console.writeline(""enter number and than + press = to end and sum all the numbers"");..do.{.    while (!console.keyavailable).    {.        op = console.readline();.    }.} while (console.readkey(true).key != consolekey.oemplus);...so this is what i thought to start with but i'm not sure if its the right way..i managed to find the key available so i think that will check whether or not the user pressed the = key...it needs to check for every char the user write but the all input in my opinion need to be string...anywhay thanks for helpers."
