"either of the properties to be assigned with a value if there are two public properties in a class, and i will need either of them to be filled by who ever creates the object of this class; is there a way in blank that can impose this behavior?..so basically if property1 has been given a value, the user should not be able to give a value to property2, or vice-verse?..if not, is there any best practice to do this, instead of creating 2 separate classes, with property1 in one class, and property2 in the second class?..or may be a method attribute that can notify the user about this behavior? would that work?"
