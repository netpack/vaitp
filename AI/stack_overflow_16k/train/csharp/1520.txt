"how to know the exe run by my application's process has completed its work i have got a 2 exe (console)..first exe provides facility to convert video formats..second exe provides facility to split video...in my application i have got 2 buttons with which both process are working fine separately..but now i wants to make it work on single click.  means first it should convert video using first exe and then split that using second exe...the problem is that how to find that first exe has finished its work so that i can start second exe to work on output's of first exe...i am running both exe by creating process...note: my both exe gets close when they done their work, so may be we can check for existing of there process but i wants experts opinion for this...thanks"
