"blank using a variable to access a windows form control i have a requirement to update a number of listview controls (i.e. listview1,listview2,listview3 etc)..i am getting an syntax error in visual studio 2015...i have broken this down to the basic issue so the error can be isolated. the following is the code i have..    private void form1_load(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        listview1.columns.add(""task"", ""task"");.        control[] testlistview = this.controls.find(""listview1"", true);.        testlistview[0].columns.add(""task22"", ""task22"");.    }...the first code line is valid. i have placed it there to simply ensure access to listview1 is ok...i am getting the syntax issue on line 3 (testlistview[0].columns.add)...the error is .'control' does not contain a definition for 'columns' and no extension method 'columns' accepting a first argument of type 'control' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)..my confusion is that when i comment out line 3 and debug and set a breakpoint after ""this.controls.find"" i can see ""testlistview"" in the locals watch window and it all looks good - the control has been found...uncomment out line 3 and visual studio highlights the .columns. with the error detailed above...any assistance or guidence in solving the basic issue will be appreciated."
