"language change with keydown event on all form i develop an application that can change language between english and hungarian. this software work with .resx files and when the user presses f2 the labels, buttons, and other controls their text properties will be changed from the .resx file. ..it's ok, but when i have more than one form open, naturally the keydown event changes those controls that are in the focused form. so my question is: how can i capture the f2 keystroke in all opened forms?"
