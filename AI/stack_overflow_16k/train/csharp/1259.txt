"blank maintain 3 threads and close one if it takes to long this is the code i am using to call 3 threads...for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++).{.    new thread(() =&gt; { processeventlogtesting(); }) {isbackground = true }.start();.}...i was thinking about adjusting it to this..public static int threadcounter = 0;..if (threadcounter &lt; 3).{.    threadcounter ++;.    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++).    {.        new thread(() =&gt; .        {.            processeventlogtesting(/*somewhere in here code says */threadcounter--;);}) {isbackground = true }.start();.        }.    }.}...however, i think this is probably not the best way to do this.  also, i want to put in a new timer that says if thread x goes over 20 minutes, kill thread x.  any help is appreciated."
