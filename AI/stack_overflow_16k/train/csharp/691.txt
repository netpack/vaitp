"using root directory string so, i am using the code as follows to find out the current windows ""main drive""..string rootdrive = path.getpathroot(environment.systemdirectory);   .string path =@""c:usersperry craftdesktoppassword.txt"";.console.writeline(""windows is installed on the "" + rootdrive + "" drive"");.if (!file.exists(@""c: users%username%desktop""))...what i am trying to do is replace the c in ""c:"" with the string value of rootdrive so that even if the windows drive is j: it would use that character and be able to save to the users desktop. do i need to parse the rootdrive string somehow or am i wrong in my thinking that all i should have to do is re write it to say ...string rootdrive = path.getpathroot(environment.systemdirectory);.string path =@""rootdrive:usersperry craftdesktoppassword.txt"";"
