"blank anonymous method, class property value rollbacks between function calls i have code like this:..public class someclass.{.     private bool flag;..     public void onbar() //this is called from dosomething();.     {.        if (flag) //for some reason flag=false.     }..     public void onfoo() //this is called from some anonymous method (not mine).     {.        flag = true;.        dosomething();.     }.}...the callstack looks like this:.anonymousmethod();.onfoo();.dosomething();.onbar();..i have read msdn article about outer variables with anonymous methods but they apply to local variables, what about class level variables...why flag is false inside onbar() method, and how to solve this problem."
