"how to sort a list using my own logic (not alphabetically or numerically) i've spent the last 30 mins looking through existing answers for what i think is a common question, but nothing quite hits it for me. apologies if this is a dupe...i've got a list of objects...list&lt;journey&gt; journeys;...the object has a 'status' property - this is a string...class journey.{.    public string name;.    public string status; .}...i want to sort based on this string, however not alphabetically. the status depicts the object's position through a journey, either ""enroute"", ""finished"", or ""error"". when sorted ascending i want them to appear in the following order: ""error"", ""enroute"", ""finished"". (in practice there are more statuses than this so renaming them to fall in alphabetical order isn't an option)..aside from creating a class for 'status' with value and sort order properties, and then sorting based on that, how do i do this? or is that the best method?"
