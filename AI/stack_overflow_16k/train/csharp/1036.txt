"change color rows in datagridview when compare date i have some trouble with a small blank project. in my database, i have 3 columns:..id(int), nameproducts(nvarchar), deadline(nvarchar)...the reason why i set the deadline field to nvarchar, is because in my form i made a datetimepicker, which set the property for this control...format: custom and custom format: dd-mm-yyyy. ..but when i insert or update a record, i always get following message: cannot convert...how could i change the color of rows in a datagridview while comparing deadline and the current time...if ( time now &lt; deadline about 3 days ) // change color to yellow.if ( time now &lt; deadline about 1 days) // change color to orange.if ( time now =&gt; deadline ) // change color to red."
