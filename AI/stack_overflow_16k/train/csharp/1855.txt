"dynamically create blank process names based on string values (filesystemwatcher) sorry, .i'm not sure about the best title for this, but i hope everybody understands...i want to have code like this..foreach (var path in locationstomonitor).{.    messagebox.show(path.tostring());.    watchpath(path, filewatchnumber);.    filewatchnumber ++;.}..private void watchpath(string path, short filewatchnumber)..{.            string filesystemwatchername = ""filemonitor"" + filewatchnumber.tostring();.            filesystemwatcher filesystemwatchername = new filesystemwatcher();...            filemonitor.synchronizingobject = this;.            filemonitor.path = locationstomonitor.first();.            filemonitor.includesubdirectories = true;.            filemonitor.notifyfilter = notifyfilters.lastaccess | notifyfilters.lastwrite.            | notifyfilters.filename | notifyfilters.directoryname;.            filemonitor.filter = ""*.*"";..            filemonitor.changed += new filesystemeventhandler(this.filemonitor_changed);.            filemonitor.created += new filesystemeventhandler(this.filemonitor_changed);.            filemonitor.renamed += new renamedeventhandler(filemonitor_onrenamed);..            filemonitor.enableraisingevents = true;.}...basically, i would like to initiate ..new filesystemwatcher();...with whatever the value of my string filesystemwatchername is so that i can dynamically create new filesystemwatchers based on how many paths are listed within a text file...so, it would create filemonitor1, filemonitor2, etc...update:..the reason why i would want to create them dynamically is that what i want my program to do is to open a text file as an array. for each newline item in that text file, i would like to create a filesystemwatcher. the only thing is, is that i don't know whether there will be one line in the file or 50 lines...i read the post about using dictionaries, but i'm not quite sure how to apply it here...i tried this, but, according to the compiler it is invalid code...            dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; filesystemwatchers = new dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();.            filesystemwatchers.add(""filemonitor"" + num.tostring(), """");.            filesystemwatcher filesystemwatchers[""filemonitor1""] = new filesystemwatcher();"
