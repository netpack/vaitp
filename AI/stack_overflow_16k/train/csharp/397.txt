"move bytewise through class members i have written the following class declaration:   ..class mycommand.{.        public byte destination;.        public byte source;.        public byte cmd;.        public byte seq;.        public uint16 length;.        public byte[] data;.        public uint16 crc;.        public byte eop;.}...now i want to iterate over all members and check if they have the value 0xed. for the uint16 types i need to compare the low byte first and then the high byte. ..is there a way to achieve this without ""manually"" checking every single member?"
