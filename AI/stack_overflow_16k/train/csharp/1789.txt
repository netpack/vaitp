"search and count specific words from a text file i would like to search for a specific set of words (or for now one word) which is ""jude"" this is my current code, i can read the file, it separates the words but its just comparing them to a word is the problem. (at the moment it is rigged up to just count words and the output is correct)...many thanks.-fred..      string theline;.        string thefile;.        int counter = 0;.        string[] fields = null;.        string delim = "" ,."";..        console.writeline(""please enter a filename:"");.        thefile = console.readline();...        system.io.streamreader sr =.               new system.io.streamreader(thefile);..        while (!sr.endofstream).        {.            theline = sr.readline();.            theline.trim();.            fields = theline.split(delim.tochararray(), stringsplitoptions.removeemptyentries);.            counter += fields.length;.        }...        sr.close();.        console.writeline(""the word count is {0}"", counter);.        console.readline();.    }"
