"how to get original google shortened url after it's been resolved so i have a google shortened url, and once i click on it and hit my controller, i want to be able to see what the original goo.gl url was before it got resolved. how on earth do i do this?..i've tried request.urlreferrer.aboluteuri and system.web.httpcontext.current.request.url.absoluteuri but neither seem to work. they all simply return the resolved absolute uri. any help on this would be greatly appreciated...here's an example of the shortened url - http://goo.gl/wsrj6..this would then take the user (in testing at least) to localhost:81/college/events/details/23..so basically, when i hit the details controller, how do i get the original shortened url back?"
