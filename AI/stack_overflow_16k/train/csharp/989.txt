"determine a object's type based on a string and create a new instance? is there any way to determine a object's type based on a string, then create a new instance of that object? ..i am currently doing something like this:..switch (type_str){.  case ""square"":.    square s = new square();.    s.dosomethingsquarey();.    dosomething(s);.    break;.  case ""circle"":.    circle c = new circle();.    c.dosomethingcircley();.    dosomething(c);.    break;.  case ""triangle"":.    triangle t = new triangle();.    t.dosomethingtriangley();.    dosomething(t);.    break;.}...all types will inherit from base class ""shape"":..public static void dosomething(shape s){.   //doing stuff....}...this will quickly get out of hand to maintain as i will need to continually add shapes to the case statement. if possible, i'd like to do something like this:..type shapetype = type.gettype(""square"");.shapetype x = new shapetype();.dosomething(x);...this will cause issues at compile time. is there another way to simplify this case statement?.thanks in advance."
