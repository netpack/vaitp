addition of times i have a problem with adding times. actually time addition is occur after am to pm...i will give you an example...arrival time | waiting time | departure time | travel time.10:30 pm     | 60           | 11:30 pm       | 0.11:30 pm     | 5            | 11:35 pm       | 5.11:40 pm     | 10           | 11:50 pm       | 10...the addition goes by these formula:...  departure time = arrival time + waiting time.  .  next arrival time = departure time + travel time...so the problem is after addition of 11:50 pm + 10 (min) it shows us . 1.00:20:00 but it should be 12:00 pm
