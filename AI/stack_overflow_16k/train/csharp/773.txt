"rounding from a double to the next 100 i am trying to round float values to the next 100 int. for example:..if the value is 128.27, the rounding method would round it to 200...if the value is 589.62, the rounding method would round it to 600...et cetera...here is what i am using so far:..    private static int roundvaluetonext100(double value) {.        int result = (int)math.round(value / 100);.        if (value &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; result == 0) {.            result = 1;.        }.        return (int)result * 100;.    }...however, this method doesn't actually round to the 100, and instead rounds to a non-100 value, though it is an integer...i was wondering why this would be, and if you could give me some pointers - thank you."
