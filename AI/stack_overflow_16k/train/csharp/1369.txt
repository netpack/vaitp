"systems of equation program i am trying to make a systems of equations program in blank. i know how to solve the problem on paper, but i'm having a hard time putting it into code. i'm pretty new at this (started programming less than a month ago, and blank a few days ago), so i know this isn't correct but it is the best i could come up with. i tried searching on here and other sites for something to send me in the right direction, but couldn't find anything. i don't want you to write the entire program for me, just maybe a few lines to give me the right idea. here is what i have so far, i realize the errors in it and why it doesn't work, i just can't find out how to fix them. ..            console.writeline(""enter first equation a: "");.            string str1a = console.readline();.            console.writeline(""enter first equation b: "");.            string str1b = console.readline();.            console.writeline(""enter first equation c: "");.            string str1c = console.readline();..            console.writeline(""enter the second equation a: "");.            string str2a = console.readline();.            console.writeline(""enter the second equation b: "");.            string str2b = console.readline();.            console.writeline(""enter the second equation c: "");.            string str2c = console.readline();..            double dbl1a = convert.todouble(str1a);.            double dbl1b = convert.todouble(str1b);.            double dbl1c = convert.todouble(str1c);.            double dbl2a = convert.todouble(str2a);.            double dbl2b = convert.todouble(str2b);.            double dbl2c = convert.todouble(str2c);..            double dbl2an = dbl2a * -1;.            double dbl2bn = dbl2b * -1;.            double dbl2cn = dbl2c * -1;..            double dbl3a = dbl1a + dbl2an;.            double dbl3b = dbl1b + dbl2bn;.            double dbl3c = dbl1c + dbl2cn;..            console.writeline(dbl3a + ""+"" + dbl3b + ""+"" + dbl3c);.            console.readline();"
