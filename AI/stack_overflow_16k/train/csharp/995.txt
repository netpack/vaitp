"randomly pick from a list of numbers until specific limit let's say i have a list of predefined numbers, and a list of predefined max limits...when a user picks a limit, i need to randomly pick a certain amount of numbers from the first list, up until their totals match (as close to, but never over) the user selected total.  ..what i've tried so far:..void main().{.    list&lt;int&gt; num = new list&lt;int&gt;(){ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,17, 18, 19, 20 };.    int maxnum = 17;..    list&lt;int&gt; curnum = new list&lt;int&gt;();.    int curtotal = 0;..    foreach(int sel in num.where(x =&gt; x &lt; maxnum)){..    curtotal += sel;..    if(curtotal &lt;= maxnum){.        curnum.add(sel);.    }...    }.}...there needs to be x amount of numbers picked. in this case, 5 numbers picked, +- 20 numbers to be randomly picked from, and 1 max values...so the end list should look like this:..1, 2, 3, 4, 7 (17).1, 2, 3, 5, 6 (17).1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (16) &lt;- this will be fine if there isn't a solution to the max value."
