"string compare where null and empty are equal using blank and .net 3.5, what's the best way to handle this situation.  i have hundreds of fields to compare from various sources (mostly strings).  sometimes the source returns the string field as null and sometimes as empty.  and of course, sometimes there is text in the fields.  my current comparison of stra != strb isn't cutting it because stra is null and strb is """", for example.  i know i could do the string.isnullorempty which results in a double comparison and some ugliness.  is there a better way to handle this?  i thought extension methods, but you can't extend operators...i guess i'm looking for a sexy way to do this."
