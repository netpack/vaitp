"improve programming skills by games development i want to improve my programming skills, and i believe that games programming is the best approach for improving my programming skills. ..can you please guide me to getting started with some very basic/little games (with source code of course) like tic-tac-toe, etc. and then to some hi-fi games like chess or snakes and ladders."
