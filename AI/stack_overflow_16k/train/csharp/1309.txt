"looping through 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 ... with modulus c sharp trying to create a function for a game .so when i go up pressing a button, i do n=(n%4)+1 and succesfully i get the sequence 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.but when i go down in the sequence, starting from one i cant find a formula that would get me the sequence 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1....any ideas? thank you for your help"
