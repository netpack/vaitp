"static newbie: are non-static variables in a static class/method implied static? when a website simultaneously hits the same static method that has non-static variables, are these variables static even though not declared static?  i would assume so, but i had to ask...another option would be that different executions of the same code have different internal variables, so this code wouldn't produce unexpected string lengths for example:..public static class myclass .{.    public static int getresult(string ext).    {.        int length = est.length;  // one place in ram or multiple?.        thread.sleep(5000);       // does this stop program execution for others?.        return length;.    }.}...question summary:...are static method variables that are not declared static implied static, i.e. simultaneous execution of static code will affect each other?.or do these variables have their own storage each?.and does thread.sleep(5000) in a static method stop all user's execution?"
