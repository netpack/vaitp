"way to extract positive and negative numbers from one array to another two (positive and negative) i'm studying blank and i was wondering if there is any way to extract positive and negative numbers (integers) from one array to others two, one that contains the positive numbers and the other negative ones..i've tried something like..public static void main(string[] args).{     .    int[] num = new int[50];.    random objeto = new random();.    int i = 0;..    for (i = 1; i &lt;= 50; i++).    {.        console.writeline(""random numbers:"");.        num[1] = objeto.next(-50, 50);.        console.writeline(num[1] + """"); .    } ..    console.readkey(); here.}...i have to create two other arrays .. int[] positive_numbers = int new [n]. int[] negative_numbers = int new [n]...and i guess i should create a method, but i do not know how i have to do it."
