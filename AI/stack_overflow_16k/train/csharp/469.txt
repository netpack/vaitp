"how to iterate through array with a length we want i have the following problem to solve..i have an array in order..10|10|10|10|10...and i have to come up with this kind of a command..""shoot left@{start index}@{length}""...iskren starts traversing the archery field to the left from {start index} with given {length}...if he goes out of the field, he will continue from the end of the field...• ""shoot right@{start index}@{length}"":..after the command, it should look for the left..10 - 10 - 10 - 5 – 10...i am new in blank and it's quite difficult. ..i have tried the last 2 hours but with no success. ..could someone just show me the right way to do it? i am just practising and i want to understand it."
