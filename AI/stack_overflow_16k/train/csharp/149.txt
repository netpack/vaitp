"how to see if async method is executing? from another method please look at my code:..private void store().{.    var books =await books.downloadasync();.    ..    ..}..private void bookcase().{.    // here how can i know if books.downloadasync() is executing or not?.}...in the above code how can i know if `books.downloadasync() is working?..update: i can't define a property like isdownloading = true, because bookcase and store are in different classes"
