"blank looking for a sortable array that handles both ints and strings i'm not really sure if what i'm looking for actually exists, so maybe you guys can help out...i have the below data:..apples|3211|12.markers|221|9.turtle|1023123123|22...the first column is always a string, the second column and third column are ints.  however, what i want to do is be able to reference theses as strings or ints, and then be able to sort via the third column asc.  any ideas?..something like mytable[i].column[i] and in this case mytable[1].column[2] would produce 12 as a int (because it's ordered)."
