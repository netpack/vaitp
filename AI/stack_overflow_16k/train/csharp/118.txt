"is there any way to initialize several variables from one array? in some languages it is possible to initialize several variables at the same time from an array..for example in php you can do something like this:..$array = array('a', 'b', 'c');.list($a, $b, $c) = $array;...is it possible to do this in blank as well? ..i want to apply this on a program where i read all lines from a file where i know every line is two words only (never more, never less). .i know i can create the function myself (and sending in variables by reference with outkeyword) but i would like to know if any built in functionality exists for it. ..i would like to know this mostly for the reason that if it is possible the code might be more readable for other developers."
