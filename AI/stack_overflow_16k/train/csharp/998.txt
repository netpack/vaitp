"blank - use symbols from other class without qualifying with classname i have declared a bunch of global constants in a class and now want to use these constants in other classes without always having to prefix the constants with the name of the class they have been declared in. example:..namespace somename.{.   public class constants.   {.      public const int someconstant = 1;.   }..   public class someclass.   {.      void somefunc ().      {.         int i = constants.someconstant;.      }.   }.}...i would like to omit constants. from constants.someconstant. using import somename.constants; didn't work. is there a way to accomplish what i want? if yes, how would i do it?"
