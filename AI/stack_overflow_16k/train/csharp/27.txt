"visual studio 2017 debug inspection not working anymore i used to be able to inspect the menuitems property of my uwp navigationview, but all of a sudden visual studio is telling me to enable native code debugging. what setting have i changed that caused this and how do i get it back? super annoying!..also, i've already tried resetting my visual studio settings, loaded symbols, and enabled symbol cache."
