"how to send keys to an application i have a very basic problem, for a game (dota 2) i want to write a little macro which opens the console, writes ""setinfo name "".........................."""" into it and then closes it, the hotkey for console is set to '#'. for this i wrote an application which listens for the key 'f' to be pressed, and then send..1) '#' (open the console).2) ""messag ebla bla b...."".3) '#' (close the console)...everything is working except that it will not open the console (but if the console is already open it will write #messagej.j....# into it when i press f just as wanted)..my code for sending the keys...sendkeys.send(""#"");.sendkeys.send(""my message for consol"");.sendkeys.send(""#"");...does anybody know why the hotkeys dont work by sending keys? i thought its an simulation of when the user presses f or q."
