"why is there a curly parenthesis in the following blank code? i am new in blank. i am following a video on a gui framework. i wonder why there is not normal parenthesis '()' but curly parenthesis '{}' after the 'new label' in the following code...are we not instantiating a class here? ..content = new label {.    horizontaloptions = layoutoptions.center,.    verticaloptions = layoutoptions.center,.    text = ""hello word"".};"
