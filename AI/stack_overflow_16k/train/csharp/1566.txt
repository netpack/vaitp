"checking to see if a filename already exists before replacing an invalid char i have this code:..   public void filecleanup(list&lt;string&gt;paths).    {.        string regpattern = (@""[~#&amp;!%+{}]+"");.        string replacement = """";.        regex regexpattern = new regex(regpattern);..        foreach (string files2 in paths).            try.            {.                string filenameonly = path.getfilename(files2);.                string pathonly = path.getdirectoryname(files2);.                string sanitizedfilename = regexpattern.replace(filenameonly, replacement);.                string sanitized = path.combine(pathonly, sanitizedfilename);.                //write to streamwriter.                system.io.file.move(files2, sanitized);....            }...now, my question is, how do i make sure that before the .replace(), that the app first checks to see if the filename does not exist?.i noticed my app, when given these test files:  ###test.txt, #~test.txt will not remove invalid chars because after a rename, they will both have the same filename (test.txt)..if it does, i want it to go to another foreach loop where i switch the invalid char to a specific char (versus a blank).  code would really help. ..thank you!"
