"html/url decode on multiple times encoded string we have a string which is readed from web page. because browsers are tolerant to unencoded special chars (e.g. ampersand), some pages using it encoded, some not... so there is a large possibility, we have stored some data encoded once, and some multiple times.....is there some clear solution, how to be sure, my string is decoded enough no matter how many times it was encoded?..here is what we using now:..public static string htmldecode(this string input).{.     var temp = httputility.htmldecode(input);.     while (temp != input).     {.         input = temp;.         temp = httputility.htmldecode(input);.     }.     return input;.}...and same using with urldecode."
