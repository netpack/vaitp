"how to parse a list or 2d array since ienumerable<t> doesn't work? sorry for the confusing question but i really don't know how to pose it better..maybe some code is better to visualize my problem...what i had at the beginning..private void drawfields(image img, list&lt;field&gt; fields , bool clear).    {            .        graphics grx = graphics.fromimage(picturebox1.image);.        if(clear).            grx.clear(color.white);.        foreach(field f in fields).        {.            grx.drawimage(img, f.x * field.width, f.y * field.height);.        }.    }...in this case i am using a list. but i also have a 2 dimensional array (not jagged) of type field. i don't want to duplicate my code and write the same function with the 2d array instead of the list. also i don't want to convert the 2d array to a list since it is unnecessarily using cpu ressources...i thought replacing the list with ienumerable would be the solution..private void drawfields(image img, ienumerable&lt;field&gt; fields , bool clear).    {            .        graphics grx = graphics.fromimage(picturebox1.image);.        if(clear).            grx.clear(color.white);.        foreach(field f in fields).        {.            grx.drawimage(img, f.x * field.width, f.y * field.height);.        }.    }...if it was a ""normal"" array it would work. but 2d arrays do not implement ienumerable&lt;t&gt;.so the following call will give me an error (where field.allfields is the 2d array)..drawfields(field_n, field.allfields, true);  ...the actual question..is there something else than ienumerable to fix this problem?"
