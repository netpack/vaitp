"reading danish characters from text files i am trying to read text files that contains some danish characters. i have found a few ways to do it using different types of encoding but the examples i have seen are reading just one file. this is what i have so far. ..//search directory for all .txt files.foreach (string files in directory.getfiles(@""c:ftpinbox"", ""*.txt"")).{     .    //the 'using' command close connection when it is done.    using (var reader = new streamreader(file.openread(files)))               .    {.        // handle contents.    }.}...my problem is all the characters are being read as ï¿½. i need them to be read in as they are."
