"blank solution to a list of system commands i currently have a blank utility that runs a very long list of steps, for instance:...copy a file from here to there .i.e.: .foreach(file in list).file.copy ().create a bunch of directories.foreach (dir in list).directory.create.loop into a list of directories and create a file. .foreach (dir in list).file.create().take a know list of files and replace some text inside.foreach (file in list).execute (""replace.exe"", text1, text2)...etc...what i did was to take all these steps and create a bunch of methods in blank that do those steps.  the advantage of that is, i get to check for each command i run, log any problems and so on.  the downside of that is, it is hard coded.  ..i would like to (and i need to) move those steps out of the code, like in a configuration file or xml file and then read the commands one at a time and run them inside blank. in this way i still have the advantage of checking for return errors, creating logs, etc. but i don't have the actual list and commands hard coded...i don't want to use a script (like perl or batch) because i want to be able to monitor some of the steps i do.  in other words, i really want to keep the actual execution inside my blank program but have the program being guided by the configuration file that i feed to it...xml is quite flexible but i am not sure i can do all that with it. for instance.how do i turn into xml something like:..list1 = {file1, file2};.list2  = {dir1,dir2,dir3};.foreach (file in list1). file.copy(file,dir2\file);. file.copy(file,dir3\file);...any ideas on what i could/should use to accomplish that?..thanks.tony"
