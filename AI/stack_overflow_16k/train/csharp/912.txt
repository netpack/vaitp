"only properties allowed in blank anonymous type i'm a beginner in blank, my textbook says anonymous type cannot have fields, only properties, like:..var myanonymoustype = new { .    firstproperty = ""first"", .    secondproperty = 2, .    thirdproperty = true .};...but isn't that a property should have sth like:..public string firstproperty { get; }...or the compiler did add it for me?"
