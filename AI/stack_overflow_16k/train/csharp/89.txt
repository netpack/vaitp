"data not reaching overridden tostring() method i have an overridden tostring() method that i want to output formatted data. this data consisted of 11 different items.  i can get all but one item to display properly but that one item just shows up as 0.  somehow, it is not reaching the tostring() method.  i debugged the program and followed the data line by line and it disappears at the point right before going to the tostring() method and i have no idea why.  here is my code.  i'm only posting the code i think is involved with passing the data.  if i am wrong and all of the code is needed, let me know...private void btnpaymentbutton_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {            .        amountpaid = double.parse(this.txtamountpaid.text);..        orderpaymentobject = new payment(orderobject.totalamountdue, amountpaid);            ..        this.txtnumberofpizzaordered.clear();.        this.txtnumberofcokesordered.clear();.        this.txtamountdue.clear();.        this.txtamountpaid.clear();..        this.lblyourorder.visible = true;.        this.rtxtyourorder.visible = true;..        this.rtxtyourorder.text =  orderobject.tostring();               .    }     ...........public class payment.{.    pizzaorder orderobject;.    double amountpaid = 0.0,.            totalamountdue = 0.0;        ..    public payment().    {.    }..    public payment(double amountdue, double payment).    {  .        orderobject = new pizzaorder();.        amountpaid = payment;.        totalamountdue = amountdue;.        orderobject.getchangedue(totalamountdue, amountpaid);.        //orderobject.tostring();            .    }..    public payment(double payment).    {.        amountpaid = payment;.    }..    public double amountpaid.    {.        get.        {.            return this.amountpaid;.        }.    }.}..........public override string tostring().    {.        payment paymentorder = new payment();..        return string.format("" {0} pizzas @ {1:c}: {2,8:c}n"" +.
