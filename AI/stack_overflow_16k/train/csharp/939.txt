"need code explanation in blank i need a detailed explanation of the following code line-by-line and how the flow goes, for example, when i debug. i have just used this code in my program for avoiding a cross thread access error. the code is working fine, but what is this code is all about?..delegate void updatetextfield(string text);.private void updatetext(string text).{.    if (txtdelegate.invokerequired).    {.        updatetextfield del = new updatetextfield(updatetext);.        txtdelegate.invoke(del, new object[] { text });.    }.    else.    {.        txtdelegate.text = text;.    }.}...this method is called under backgroundworker_dowork():..updatetext(""using delegate"");...i also need an explanation for delegates. i read about it, but what i understood is that a delegate is like a pointer to a function, but i need a clean explanation with a simple example. think of me as a novice."
