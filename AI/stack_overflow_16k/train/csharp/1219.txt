"configuring if statements for better flexibility and scalability? so i have two objects of the same type. the object looks like this: ..public batchofstuff(int id, list&lt;stuff&gt; stufflist)...currently, my code looks like this: ..if (stufflist1.any()){.    var batchstuff1 = new batchofstuff(1, stufflist1);.    var transformedbatch = typeatransformer.transformbatch(batchstuff1);.    validatetransformedbatch(transformedbatch);.}.if (stufflist2.any()){.    var batchstuff2 = new batchofstuff(2, stufflist2);.    var transformedbatch = typebtransformer.transformbatch(batchstuff2);.    validatetransformedbatch(transformedbatch);.}...as you can see, the stuff in the two if statements are pretty much the same, the only difference being that one uses a typeatransformer and the other a typebtransformer. typeatransformer and typebtransformer both inherit from a base class called transformer. it is possible that in the future, there will be typectransformers and typedtransformers that follow the same pattern as the above. is it possible for me to not have the duplicated code within the if statements? thanks!"
