"is there a delay in between statements in blank? i'm not sure how to explain what i'm trying to ask so consider the following example:..int number;..void changenumber().{.    number++;.    usenumber(number);.}..void usenumber(int value).{.    // use number.}...i'm using this simple example to try to find out if when scripts are ran, it waits for one task to be completed before moving onto the next. for example, is usenumber(number) only called once the number has been incremented before it? ..consider instead of number++ i was making a call to another method which did some complex calculations and also made it's own calls to other methods, would usenumber(number) still wait for all that to run before being called? if not, would a callback be a good option for that situation to ensure previous tasks are completed first?"
