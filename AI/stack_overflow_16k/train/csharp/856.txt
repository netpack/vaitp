"how can i read and display info from multiple text files in 1 message box blank? so i have a application that uses check boxes and radio buttons to scan a computer for virus then have each anti virus create a log of its actions. what id like to do is (based on which check boxes (there's 5 total) are checked) have a message box pop up when its all done and have read each text file for a key word then read that line, for all 5 text files (if all 5 were created could be 1,2,3,4 or 5 of them). so when its all done it will just have 1 message box pop up with the info from all 5 text files 1 line each like ""panda found 5 viruses"" next line ""a squared found 0 viruses"" etc. then when the message box is closed, delete the text files. i know how to do this with 1 check box and 1 text file but i don't know how to do this with multiple check boxes and multiple text files. my single file reader works like this:..int counter = 0;.string line;..// read the file and display it line by line..system.io.streamreader file = new system.io.streamreader(""c:\panda.txt"");.while ((line = file.readline()) != null).{.    if (line.contains(""number of files infected"")).    {.        messagebox.show(""panda "" + line);.    }.}.file.dispose();.system.io.file.delete(""c:\panda.txt"");...any help would be nice thanks. oh and blank .net 2.0 only please"
