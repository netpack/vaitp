"which operand calls the overloaded function in c++ the first operand(object) will call the overloading function. what will do the same in blank? which operand? because in blank we have both operands sent to the function for example for + like this:..public static rectangle operator + (rectangle x,rectangle y)...and the second question. if we want to perform this for two different types (consider object1 and object2 from different class types) where should we define the function?"
