"cannot convert type error, but both types are the same? ..public static dictionary&lt;string, user&gt; userlist = new dictionary&lt;string, user&gt;();...that's how ""userlist"" gets declared in another class. btw the name of that class is ""user"" the same as the type, which could cause the problem but i am not sure. i have no idea how to make this work honestly...here's the full script: https://pastebin.com/h56ukpgr.some things in the script dont make sense yet because i copied some stuff from another script...but basically i am trying to check if a nickname already exists in a static dictionary, and if so notify the user and don't do anything else."
