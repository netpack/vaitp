"url decoding confusion i've got a db that refers to the following url:..http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbert_gr%f6nemeyer..however, it seems that this is a bad urlencoding, causing problems with both httputility.urldecode (gives me garbage) and uri.unescapedatastring (uriformatexception). my browser passes the path on to wikipedia unaltered (so i assume the %f6 gets encoded by the browser), as follows:..get /wiki/herbert_gr%f6nemeyer http/1.1..wikipedia recognizes and 301 redirects to:..location: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbert_gr%c3%b6nemeyer..what's going on here? does wikipedia have an additional proprietary encoding?..edit: i've got a local copy of wikipedia which i am attempting to cross reference aganst this url. the articles are indexed by title, which in this case would be: ""herbert grönemeyer"". can anyone suggest how i would go from ""herbert_gr%f6nemeyer"" to ""herbert grönemeyer"" in code. obviously the underscore is not the problem here."
