"enum in propertygrid - simple custom sort order i have an enum and i want to customize the order it appears in the drop-down of a property grid...public enum dir : int.{.   none = 0,.   north = (1 &lt;&lt; 1),.   south = (1 &lt;&lt; 2),.   east = (1 &lt;&lt; 3),.   west = (1 &lt;&lt; 4),.   northwest = north | west,.   northeast = north | east,.   southwest = south | west,.   southeast = south | east.} ...i want the drop-down to appear in the same order as i have declared the enum, but instead it sorts into numerical order...i know it's possible to do with a type converter, but is it possible to do it without?"
