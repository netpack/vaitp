"blank invoke method console write demo the code snippet below is from an asp.net mvc application. it accepts all parameters from browser. i believe it's vulnerable. ..i'm testing an application's security, it uses invoke method, but accepts the object type, method and parameters dynamically from user's input. i believe it is dangerous and i'm trying to prove it...do you think i can invoke console.write or execute some sort of arbitrary/dangerous code?..i want to try to use blank invoke method to write to console to prove the vulnerability. this is what i did:..static void main(string[] args).{.    type magictype = type.gettype(""system"");.    constructorinfo magicconstructor = magictype.getconstructor(type.emptytypes);.    object magicclassobject = magicconstructor.invoke(new object[] { });                ..    methodinfo magicmethod = magictype.getmethod(""console.write"");.    object magicvalue = magicmethod.invoke(magicclassobject, new object[] { 100 });.}...but it doesn't work. it says object is not initialized. what am i missing?"
