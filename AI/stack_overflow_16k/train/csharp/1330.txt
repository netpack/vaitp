"fastest way to move a chunk of bytes from one position in a byte array to another within the same array so the question is pretty straight forward. i have a byte array and i want to move a chunk of those bytes from index i to index i - delta...currently i'm using array.copy but i'm worried that it might have trouble if the source and destination is the same. also, array.copy deals with any array and since i have this specific type i was wondering if there exists a faster solution."
