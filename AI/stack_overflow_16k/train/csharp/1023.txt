"how to fix ""conversion of string to delegate"" i am writing a code snippet (strings) for test which contains a method in constructor, the parameters of the method are string and delegate. i have delegate placed in code snippet but while compiling the compiler doesn't recognize the second parameter as delegate but instead recognizes as method group...i have tried casting the second parameter to delegate type..class test : abstractclassa.{                 .    public test()   .    {.        invoke(""somestring"", methoddelegate);.    }..    private void methoddelegate(string a, string b).    { ..    }.}...public abstract class abstractclassa.{.    protected void invoke(string a, string b).    {..    }.}...invoke has delegate as methoddelegate as delegate in second parameter while the entire string (first code block) gets compiled, compiler has to recognize methoddelegate as delegate but not as method group"
