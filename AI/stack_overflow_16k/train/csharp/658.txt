"is there any practical difference between an extension method on <t> or on object? is there any practical difference between these two extension methods?..class extensions.{.    public static void foo&lt;t&gt;(this t obj) where t : class { ... }.    public static void foo(this object obj) { ... }.}...i was poking around in extension overflow and i came across the first form, which i haven't used before. curious what the difference is."
