"blank basic function concatenation to avoid using switch i am looking for a smarter way to call functions without using switch. my problem is as below:.i have many function calls that read something like .    this.map.functionapple();.    this.map.functionpeach();.    this.map.functionorange();..i am currently calling a parent function fruit(""orange"") which basically is a huge function with switch which selects the function this.map.functionorange().is there a way where i can simply do:..this.map.function+name+();"
