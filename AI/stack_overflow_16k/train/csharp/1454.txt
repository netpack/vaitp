"what is the best way to open and close a file without the `using` keyword i'm fairly new to blank. in python you have the option of either using the with keyword, or simply calling f = open('filename') and f.close(). is there a blank equivalent to the later?..i'm avoiding using using because i'm trying to write bindings for a language which doesn't have a syntactic equivalent. i was hoping to write a class which had a open() and close() methods, and keep it as 1:1 as possible."
