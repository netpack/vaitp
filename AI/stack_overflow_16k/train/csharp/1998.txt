"cross-thread operation not valid: control 'form2' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on i have 2 forms, in form1 , there are  a lot of transaction to be done, so i have used the backgroundworker. so during the action to be taken i want the form2 to be opened and shows the progressbar ( the progress of the actions ) so i have done like this:..this is form1..public partial class form1 : form.{.    form2 form2 = new form2();.    public form1().    {.        initializecomponent();.        shown += new eventhandler(form1_shown);..        // to report progress from the background worker we need to set this property.        backgroundworker1.workerreportsprogress = true;.        // this event will be raised on the worker thread when the worker starts.        backgroundworker1.dowork += new doworkeventhandler(backgroundworker1_dowork);.        // this event will be raised when we call reportprogress.        backgroundworker1.progresschanged += new progresschangedeventhandler(backgroundworker1_progresschanged);.    }..    void form1_shown(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        form2.show();.        // start the background worker.        backgroundworker1.runworkerasync();..    }...    private void backgroundworker1_dowork(object sender, doworkeventargs e).    {.        // your background task goes here.        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i++).        {.            // report progress to 'ui' thread.            backgroundworker1.reportprogress(i);.            // simulate long task.            system.threading.thread.sleep(100);.        }.        form2.close();.    }...    private void backgroundworker1_progresschanged(object sender, progresschangedeventargs e).    {.        // the progress percentage is a property of e.        form2.progressbar1.value = e.progresspercentage;.    }.}...i have a progressbar in form2 which its modifier is public. the problem is that when the actions would be accompilshed the form2 ( which contans the progress bar) should be closed , so i used..    form2.close();...but i get this error message..  cross-thread operation not valid: control 'form2' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on...how can i solve this problem?"
