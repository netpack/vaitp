"blank...help me understand the include of _db.users.include(""something"") a newbie question, i know; however, i see it quite often and don't understand what the .include is doing...if it matters i'm working in mvc 4 and blank...i know that _db is a reference to my context. _db.users references my dbset users within the context...so i have a table with records of users and can do all sorts of things and i'm good there. but what is the .include(""something"") doing?..one example i've seen is as follows. i get that it pulls a single user record, of type user, for strusername. short of that, i'm lost about the .include(""userroles"")...user user = _db.users.include(""userroles"").single(u =&gt; u.username == strusername);...after some help, i understand it is related to eager loading. but i still can't find anything that helps to understand the model structures to accommodate it."
