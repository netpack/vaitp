"test for last iteration of for loop in blank    public string getupgradespurchasedval().   {.        string upgradespurchasedvals = """";.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; upgradespurchased.count; i++) {.            if (i == upgradespurchased.count) {.                upgradespurchasedvals += upgradespurchased [upgradenames[i]].tostring () + ""$"";.            } else {.                upgradespurchasedvals += upgradespurchased [upgradenames[i]].tostring () + ""|"";.            }.        }.        return upgradespurchasedvals;.    }.....so here i am looping through the dictionary&lt;string,bool&gt; upgradespurchased and i am trying to make sure if the for loop is at the last iteration marked by the line if(i == upgradespurchased.count) what i expected to happen in this case is if i is equal to the number of items in the dictionary then the string would receive a ""$"" at the end of it instead of a ""|"" however it would seem that the line is ignored altogether..summary: i need to test if the for loop is at the last iteration if so then ""$"" should be added to the string if not ""|"" should be added to the string"
