"how can you write assign a default value from an array when the element does not exist? this situation has always nagged me.  just as an example, suppose a console application expects filepath in as a command line argument...string first = args[0]; ...but if there are no arguments, then an error will occur.  i suppose i could do something like the following:..string first = (args[0]!=null) ? args[0] : ""c:"";...what i'm looking for is something a bit more elegant like:..string first = (mytryparse(args[0],""c:"");...which i could write as an extension, however that won't work because args[0] will throw an exception before the method can be called."
