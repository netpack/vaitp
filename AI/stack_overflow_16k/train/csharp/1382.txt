"how do i add a reference from a for loop to the string format in the writeline function? i have looked about everywhere (exaggeration) before i started asking the question and have come up with nothing, i think the question may be confusing but i am trying to pass the variable i to the parameters in the writeline(..) method string, here is an example;..expression&lt;func&lt;int, int, int&gt;&gt; expression = (a, b) =&gt; a + b;.        for(int i = 0; i &lt; expression.parameters.count; i++).        {.            console.writeline(""expression param[{i+1}]: {i}"", expression.parameters[i]);.        }...is this valid in blank? to add the int i into the console.writeline(..) method...i have also tried:..console.writeline(""expression param[{"" + i+1 +""}]: {""+ i +""}"", expression.parameters[i]);"
