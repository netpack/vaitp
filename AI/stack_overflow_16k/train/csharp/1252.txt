"blank possible to have a constructor in an abstract class? i have 1 abstract class that is calling a static method which up until now didn't require any parameters. this has recently changed. in reality the static method exists in another class and sets the value of basemessagedirectory, but in this example below i have simplified things.....so now i want to create my derived classes in such a way that they can initialize some required properties in the parent class during the inheritance, is this possible?..for example...... public abstract class parentclass.    {.          protected string basemessagedirectory;..          protected parentclass(enumoperationtype operationtype).             {.                if(operationtype == 1).                  {.                     basemessagedirectory = ""one"";.                  }.                else.                  {.                     basemessagedirectory = ""two"";.                  }.             }.    }"
