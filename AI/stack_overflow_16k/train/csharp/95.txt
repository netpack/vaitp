"list<t>contains method as extension method not working? i want to write an extension method like the contains method of the list class for the list class that takes an null able object. .my extension method is :..public static class customlist.    {.        public static bool contains&lt;t&gt;(this list&lt;t&gt; lst, nullable&lt;t&gt; obj) where t : struct.        {.            bool bcontains = false;.            if (obj == null).            {.                bcontains = false;.            }.            else.            {.                t obj1 = (t)obj.value;.                bcontains = lst.contains(obj1);.            }..            return bcontains;.        }.}...my  linq code which calls the extension method is given below:..var lstjobactivity = (from objactivity in context.vw_job_activity.                                  where jobassignid.contains(objactivity.assign_id) &amp;&amp; objactivity.activity_type == ""jbintv"".                                  select objactivity).tolist&lt;vw_job_activity&gt;();...where objactivity.assign_id is null...the error is showing is given below:...  linq to entities does not recognize the method 'boolean contains[int64](system.collections.generic.list1[system.int64], system.nullable1[system.int64])' method, and this method cannot be translated into a store expression."
