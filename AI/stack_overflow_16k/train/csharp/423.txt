"can we have a dll built in .net v2.0 references another built in .net v4.5? i need to have a dll built in .net v2.0 to be called from sql server 2008 as an external dll (clr assembly). this dll must be in .net v2.0 to be compatible with our sql server version and is only to make a bridge between sql server and other blank features developed in .net v4.5. so i refence another dll built in .net v4.5 but i can't compile it! i have the fallowing warning:...  warning msb3258: the primary reference ""my_dll"" could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the .net framework assembly ""mscorlib, version=4.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=b77a5c561934e089"" which has a higher version ""4.0.0.0"" than the version ""2.0.0.0"" in the current target framework....can we ignore the assembly version compability ? or can we have another solution to invoke any function developed in .net v.4.5 from a sql server 2008 ?"
