"find item in list by property and know the item name i have struggled with figuring out how to find an item in a list by checking for a property and then isolating and naming this item. i need to do this to set a value that corresponds with that specific string. it wouldn't work if i just found that there is one, or several items in the list that match the property. my code is massive, but here's a snippet of it:..list&lt;string&gt; diag_right = new list&lt;string&gt;();.diag_right.add(b3); //add the string b3.diag_right.add(b5); //add the string b5.diag_right.add(b7); //add the string b7..if (diag_right.exists(a =&gt; a.equals(""""))).{.    //find the item (string name, b3, b5, etc.) that was found as matching the blank property.}...is it possible to do this? i know i can do this by checking to see if each string matches this property individually, but is there a faster way to do this?"
