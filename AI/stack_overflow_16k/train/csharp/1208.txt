"blank can i call either of the two: class.method.method? or class.class.method? blank beginner here.. so my example is next: ..i have a 'car' class with two methods: 'wheels' , 'doors'. i also need that my two methods call other methods like 'color' or 'shape' so in the end i will be able to call:..car car = new car();..car.wheels.shape();..car.doors.color();...would that be possible somehow?..thanks in advance."
