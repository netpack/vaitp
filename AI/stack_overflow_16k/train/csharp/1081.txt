"anonymous struct declaration say i have the following declarations:..struct somestructure.{.    string message;.    int startvalue;.    int endvalue;.}..somestructure _somestructure;...i will never have more than one somestructure variable declared so i was wondering if there's a way to combine the two together in a single statement, something like:..struct somestructure.{.    string message;.    int startvalue;.    int endvalue;.} _somestructure;...i need to make it explicit that no other variables using the struct are to be declared."
