"move or delete when file open is it possible to move/delete a file inside using a statement like this:..using (.    var filestream = new filestream(.        @""somesharesomefile.txt"",.        filemode.open,.        fileaccess.read,.        fileshare.none,.        512,.        fileoptions.none)).{.    // here how to remove that file and then release stream? .}...what i want to achieve is to copy the file to the archive after my process finishes processing, but before releasing the stream...if i move the file after using statement it is possible that some other instance of my code will lock the file. ..fileoptions.deleteonclose is not an option because i do not want to remove the file if there will be any exception inside using statement"
