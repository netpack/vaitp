"gridview datakeys enumeration null after sort function i sorted a gridview programtically using the code below:..grdcars.sort(grdcars.columns[3].tostring(), sortdirection.ascending);...however when i went to get the datakeys value after this using the code-below:..grdcars.datakeys[i].value.tostring()...it throws a ""system.argumentoutofrangeexception"" as the datakeys ""enumeration yielded no results"" ie it was wiped after the sort...can anyone correct this please? can i programtically sort the gridview without removing the datakeys enumeration?..any suggestions/comments/code-samples much appreciated..."
