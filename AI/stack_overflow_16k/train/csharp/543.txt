"blank is holding data in a delimited string bad practice is it bad practice to have a string like .""name=gina;postion= housematriarch;id=1234"" to hold state data in an application.i know that i could just as well have a struct , class or hashtable to hold this info.  ..is it acceptable practice to hold delimited key/value pairs in a database fieldâ€“ just for use in where the data type is not known at design time.  ..thanks...i am just trying to insure that i maintain good design practices"
