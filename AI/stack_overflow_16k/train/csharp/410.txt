"how can i run nbench benchmarks in a particular order i have a set of nbench benchmarks that i want to run in a particular order. they will use each other's results to save time (it's a big data set)...how can i specify this order? the tests are mainly executed using the nbench.runner executable...their default order is at least not alphabethic, i don't know if it's any particular order, but i'd like to prescribe one."
