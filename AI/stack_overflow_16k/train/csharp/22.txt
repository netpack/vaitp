"datatable.rows.find gives ""table doesn't have a primary key"" error when table gets too big working with a .net 3.5 project and i have a datatable i fill from a mysql table.  the table contains an ""email"" column that i need to search on.  i am explicitly setting the primary key, and the following code works fine until i get 422 or more rows in the table...object[] searchfor = new object[] { row[""email""] };.datacolumn[] pk = new datacolumn[] { dtaccounts.columns[""email""] };.dtaccounts.primarykey = pk;.match = dtaccounts.rows.find(searchfor);...i thought maybe there was some bad data in the 422nd record, but have verified that's not the case.  the error i get is ""table doesn't have a primary key"", which it obviously does."
