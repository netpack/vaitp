"printing a string to the console from a method .net 4.0 yesterday i asked a question here about how a method writes to the console.  today, i wrote this quick little program that doesn't work like i thought it would.  the program in the link never has a call from the main method to write anything to the console, and yet text will appear there.  i tried to follow the same logic with the little snippet below and it doesn't do anything.  why isn't the program below writing the word ""hello"" to the console?  edit: link here..using system;.class daysinmonth.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.        int[] daysinmonth = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };.        console.write(""enter the number of the month: "");.        int month = convert.toint32(console.readline());.        console.writeline(""that month has {0} days"", daysinmonth[month - 1]);..    }.    static void writeit(string s).    {.        string str = ""hello"";.        console.writeline(str);.    }.}"
