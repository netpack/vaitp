"how to resolve ambiguous interface method signatures, occuring when multiple generic type arguments are identical in the example below, is there a way for a method of the implementing class to explicitly tell the compiler which interface member it implements?.i know it's possible to resolve ambiguity between interfaces, but here it is within one interface...interface ifoo&lt;a,b&gt;.{.    void bar(a a);.    void bar(b b);.}..class foo : ifoo&lt;string, string&gt;.{.    public void bar(string a) { }.    public void bar(string b) { }  // ambiguous signature.}"
