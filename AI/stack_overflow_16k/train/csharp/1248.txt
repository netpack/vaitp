"dependency between singletons in different assemblies singleton b initializes singleton a.  singleton a has no knowledge of b.  how can we use a and be sure that b has done its initialization routine first?  ..b and a are in different assemblies and are maintained by different teams...trying to keep the implementations completely seperate.....the best answer seems to be just don't.  here's what i'm thinking thought:..kick off the initialisation via a registration class that implements a certain interface. if a dosomething gets called, and t is in an assembly we haven't seen before, then we search for a class with the given iregistration interface. ..so... that would get rid of the dependency.  it'd use reflection.  we'd have to look up the types assembly home each time a method got called, but not too high a price to pay perhaps"
