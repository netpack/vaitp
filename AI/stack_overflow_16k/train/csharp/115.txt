"registering mousedown and mousemove on form how and where can i register a mouse event on a form.  when i doubleclick on the form it'll generate the form_load event for me and i can add code into there.  however when i add something like..private void form1_mousedown(object sender, mouseeventargs e{..console.writeline(""mouse down"")..}...however when i do a mousedown event on the form i don't get anything on the console.  i know something is missing where i register the event to the form or something of the sort.  any ideas?..thanks,"
