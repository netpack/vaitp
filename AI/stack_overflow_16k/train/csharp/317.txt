"calling a fuction from a .cs file in a .dll i seem to be running into a problem while coding.  i am writing a dll for blank.  in my dll i need to place some code in a function.  the problem that i run into is that the code i need to place in the function is written in the program that is using the dll.  for example:..mydll.dll..using otherguydll.dll..public void function1().{.    otherguyeventhandler += dllfunction;.}..private void dllfunction(object sender, eventargs e).{.    programfunction();.}...program.cs..using mydll.dll..public void programfunction().{.    //my code.}...the problem occurs when mydll.dll is compiled.  you get an error since programfunction() does not exist due to the dll not being used by program.cs at the time.  is there anyway around this?..edit: to further explain, dllfunction() is actually called by an event handler. i'm using a 3rd party dll in my dll.  i want the user of my dll to be able to specify some code which will in turn be used during an event.  the purpose of my dll is mainly for ease of use.  i've updated my example code to better picture this."
