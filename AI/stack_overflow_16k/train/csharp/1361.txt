"checking multiple conditions in an if else block this seems like it should be simple, but this block of code is not working...i just need to check and make sure the current race_position is not equal to the total count or not greater than the count or not equal to 0. if it's any of those, then i want to break out of the loop...i even went through it in the visual studio debugger, and saw when race_position was 0, it still acted as if it was not 0 and never broke out of the loop...is there a way to simply this and make it work?..thanks!..if (race_position != race_team.count || !(race_position &gt; events.count) || race_position != 0).{.    next_position = (race_position + 1);.}.else.{.    break;.}"
