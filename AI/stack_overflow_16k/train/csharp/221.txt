"blank using params variable name in class i have the following class definition:..class postobject.{.    public string jsonrpc { get; set; }.    public string method { get; set; }.    public myobject params { get; set; }.    public string id { get; set; }.}...i use this class for a post call (serialized in json) and the server has 'params' as an input post var and there's no way to change it...the question is that as params is a reserved keyword in blank, what should i do?"
