"string replace with exception on certain strings i have this line of code that i'm using to prepare some css file:..theminifiedcss = theminifiedcss.replace(""white"", ""#fff"");...the problem is that in css, i have this declaration:...someclass{white-space:pre-wrap;}...how do i change the .replace statement to replace white with #fff but to leave white-space alone?..thanks...note, i know i can add theminifiedcss = theminifiedcss.replace(""#fff-space"", ""white-space""); but i'm looking for something cleaner."
