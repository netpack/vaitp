"need propertygrid with drill-down, similar to quickwatch i am trying to display object data members in a generic way.  i started by using propertygrid, which satisfies my needs as far as simple properties are concerned.  however, it doesn't let the user drill-down into data members.  it allows browsing into collections, but the interface is a bit awkward...i'm basically looking for something with the features of quickwatch.  does anybody know of any libraries that can do drill-down?"
