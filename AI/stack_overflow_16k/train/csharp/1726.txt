"how to create and print sales ticket with images and rich text good afternoon:..i'm stuck like two weeks with the creation of sales tickets and their printing...i know there is a good example with rawprinterhelper but this does not allow to modify fonts (type, size, bold, color, etc)...on the other hand i've seen itexsharp but i do not know how to print tickets with a long variable and give the page cut in a thermal (sequence escape)...same as above, how would you do it with stringformat, printdocument or similar?..in conclusion, what would be the best option?..thank you..regards"
