"how to add row number to each row in datagrid wpf? i have a such datagrid....as you can see on screenshot i have a column path to clip folder and below 3 rows, i would like to add at the left row numbers (like 1, 2, 3) for each row. ..i found this solution ..https://stackoverflow.com/a/9581709/5709159..but as far as i understand it will add numbers like hardcode, and if i delete (for example) row 2 i will see row numbers like 1 and 3... ..question is - is there a way that datagrid numerate each row automatically?"
