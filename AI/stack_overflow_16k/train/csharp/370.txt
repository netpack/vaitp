"dictionary with action with unknown parameters as value i have to create a dictionary of commands with the command (a string) being the key and the function the command is mapping to as the value..the problem i am facing is that the functions the commands are mapping to, have different amounts of parameters with different types...how do i achieve this? preferably, so that i can add the functions as lambda expressions...ex. dictionary.add(""square"", x =&gt; x * x)...edit: all the mapped functions return void."
