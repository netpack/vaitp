"how do i write selenium variables to a text file? i'm automating a web application and for finishing the tests i want to print the values generated during the process to a text file. i'm not so clear in how to accomplish this, i have printed the variable in the name of the file successfully. however the text inside the file is not being printed... using (streamwriter writer = new streamwriter(convert.tostring(vars[""variable1""]) + "".txt"", true)).            {..                writer.writeline(today); //today date//.                writer.writeline(""generated info 1: "", vars[""variable1""].tostring());.                writer.writeline(""generated info 2: "", vars[""variable2""].tostring());.                writer.writeline(""generated info 3: "", vars[""variable3""].tostring());.                writer.writeline(""generated info 4: "", vars[""variable4""].tostring());...            }...thanks!"
