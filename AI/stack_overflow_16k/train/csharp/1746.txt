"compare two datetimes - without hour and second as the title states, what's the best way to compare to datetime's without hours and seconds?..i don't want to convert my dates to string, and a solution like...  datetime.now.year == last.year &amp;&amp;.  datetime.now.month == last.month &amp;&amp;.  datetime.now.day == last.day...is pretty damn ugly...edit: oh my god, how silly i feel. of course you can use the date property...""another question"": what is the best way to compare datetime's with year, month, day, hour, minute, but not seconds?..thanks"
