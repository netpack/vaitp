"how to add a text to checkbox from form2 to form 1 (blank) so, i've just started learning blank and i have been looking on tutorials in youtube but in console applications. ..i have now made my first wfa and i'm trying to create a calendar where you can add different times with different texts so you stay informed for example a upcoming test. ..so far i've come this far: it's in swedish..and i've also connected the ""l√§gg till"" (add in english) to another form called laggtill ..connection in codeform -..laggtill lgtl = new laggtill ();.lgtl.show ();...form2 called laggtill looks like:.also in swedish..so my question is, how can i by pressing the ""spara"" button (save in english) put the text from the textbox in laggtill form to the checkbox in the ""kommande datum:"" checkbox?"
