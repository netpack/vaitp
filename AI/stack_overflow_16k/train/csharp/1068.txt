"creating collection dynamically in blank i have an application that will continuously taking user's input and store the input in a list of class itemsvalue..how am i going to make it so that once the collection reaches 1000 counts, it will ""stop"" and a new collection will be created and so on...for example:..list&lt;itemsvalue&gt; collection1 = new list&lt;itemsvalue&gt;();.//user input will be stored in `collection1`.if (collection1.count &gt;= 1000).    //create a new list&lt;itemsvales&gt; collection2, .    //and the user input will be stored in collection2 now..    //and then if collection2.count reaches 1000, it will create collection3. .    //collection3.count reaches 1000, create collection4 and so on."
