"why can my lambda expressions not use the same internal variable? i am new to blank and was working with these lambda values...my question is why can the parameter list not be the same variable in each of them? if you notice in print (q is the variable) and in square (c is the variable) and in add (x, y) are the variables and in islessthanten (f is the variable) what if i wanted to make them all the same parameter name, like say pizza can this be done. it was on the tutorial i was watching. my second minor question is how would this make the code better if you rather than just using a regular function?..i think that these are called lambda expression. i heard a couple of different names on the tutorial video...question: can the same variable be used in different lambda expressions?..i want to know if i can say use the variable index in all of my lambda expressions..  action&lt;int&gt; print = index =&gt; console.writeline(index);...code:..action&lt;bool&gt; print = q =&gt; console.writeline(q);.func&lt;double, double&gt; square = c =&gt; c * c;.func&lt;double, double, double&gt; add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;.predicate&lt;double&gt; islessthanten = f =&gt; f &lt; 10;..print(islessthanten(square(add(4, 5))));..console.readkey();"
