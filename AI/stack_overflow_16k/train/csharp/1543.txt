"blank learning for a beginner : to do a project without having read big concepts after 3 years working as an it support technician, i decided to change of field and get to programming...i am learning blank through the wrox beginning visual blank 2008 book, that i use as guideline...i have read the whole poo part (inheritance, polymorphism,....delegates,...)..i have started the second part which is windows programming (winforms)..i know that lots of you recommend to do some working applications in order to practice, but how can i do some personnal projects if i haven't even started concepts like sql server, linq or network programming, wpf, wcf.... those topics are enumarated at the end of the book. ..i am just trying to find the best method : should i first finish this book and then start to code, or should i just do a project without having read the hot topics  or jump straight forward to those topics...i dont know if you see what i mean as english isn't my first language. but if you don't i can improve my explanation."
