"write to standard output when no console present console.write* works as expected when used with a console application, or a windowed application with a console attached. ..however, if i make an application that does not have a console and run it from the command line, it does not output as expected. it appears to start the application asynchronously as the prompt reappears while the program is still running. ..how can i output in such a way that text output will appear in an attached console or a command prompt that runs it? or, how do i run the application differently where it waits correctly and captures the expected output?"
