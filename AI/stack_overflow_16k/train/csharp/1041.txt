"logical doubts in calculation inside gridview ..i got a gridview which shows in the above image. a small logical clarification need to be solved. i got 2 ranges 56-68 and 74-80. 56-68 should add in row 1(260,520,520) under 68 and 74-80 should add in row 1(260,260) under 80 and should give result in a next row(should create new row where row 2 becomes row 3) ...how could this be done??"
