"add char to empty string blank ive got an empty string s = """";..ive got a char b = '0';..char b is in a loop so changes after every, i want to keep adding that char b to the string s,..for example, after the first loop string s = ""0"".after second round s = ""01""..in java its simple to do that for an empty string with string s += char b;.couldnt find anything like that on blank, is there an easier way than building a string builder or making a dummy string?"
