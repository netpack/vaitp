"how to stop an ongoing timer linked to a timed action i use system.timers.timer to start a timer. there is an event that.is raised occasionally, every time this event raises i increment a counter. .if the counter > 3, i execute a method to perform an action and i need to repeatedly do this...i reset the counter every n seconds to start counting the events again from 1. .when the counter resets to 0, i need to stop the ongoing action that gets triggered by the timer, but i can't get it to stop and this method keeps on executing even after the counter has reset to 0...my program has this structure:..class program.{.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            var counter = 0;..            //create timer.            var delaytimer = new system.timers.timer.            {.               // interval = 900000, // every 15 minutes .                interval = 45000, // debug .                autoreset = true,.            };..            // start the timer.            delaytimer.start();...        delaytimer.elapsed += ((o, e) =&gt;.                {.                    // when timer elapses reset the counter.                    counter = 0;.                    // stop the timed action function which was executing every n seconds for counter &gt; 3.                    timedtask(1, false, ""stop""); // stop the timer.                });...        // an event raises the counter..            while (event).            {..                counter++;  // keeps track of events raised..                if (counter &gt; 3).                {.                    // take a specific action.                    timedtask(30000, true); // start the timer to perform an action every 30 seconds.                }..            }..            // to keep the application going.            system.windows.forms.application.run();..        }..    }..    // method to start a timer for repeating a task every n seconds, or stop the counter for this ongoing timed task.    public static void timedtask(int interval, bool autoreset, string stop = null).        {  .            //create timer.            var delaytimer = new system.timers.timer.            {.                interval = interval, // every n seconds.                autoreset = autoreset, // true: repeat, false: don't repeat.            };...            if (stop != null).            {..                delaytimer.elapsed += ((o, e) =&gt;.                {.                    // if 'stop' passed as string, stop executing the task every n seconds.                    delaytimer.stop(); .                });...            }.            else.            {.                // start the timer.                delaytimer.start();..                // create the event handler.                delaytimer.elapsed += ((o, e) =&gt;.                {.                    // when timer elapses call the method below.                    repeatedaction();.                });.            }..        }..    // repeated action method.    public static void repeatedaction().    {..        // perform an action, repeat it every n seconds..    }....}...i have tried sending an additional string parameter ""stop"" to un-register the timer but this does not work...i am creating two different timers: one for resetting the counter and one for repeating the timed task, could i minimise this by creating a timer method or something? thanks in advance."
