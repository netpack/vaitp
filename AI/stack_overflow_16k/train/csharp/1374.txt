"should adding a new item to a list<> update previous items in the list? i have a list of stockmultibuy items, and am building a list of those items. some of the items in the list i want to have different properties than existing items, and so i tried to create a new instance of the item, changed the property that i wanted, and then added it to the list. i wasn't expecting this to update items that were already in the list. is this expected behaviour? is there anything i can do to overcome this?..thanks..stockmultibuy anewitem = staticlists.getstockmultibuyforbarcode(sbarcode);..// if we've got enough items to qualify, then add a free item.if (reward.stockitemstaken.count % (reward.freewhenqualified + reward.qualifyingqty).    == reward.qualifyingqty).{.    anewitem.promoprice = 0;.}.// save this for later so that we know we've added a regular item.else.{.    anewitem.promoprice = convert.todecimal(anewitem.sell);.}..reward.stockitemstaken.add(anewitem);"
