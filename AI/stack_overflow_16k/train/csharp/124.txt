"label selection via tab key i have multiple labels &amp; text boxes in my form. when the user tabs through the form, the focus never gets to labels..text boxes get focus and the cursor is shown in them, but there's no focus rectangle on text boxes...if am right, the default windows behavior is not to make labels selectable via focus rectangle...is there a way of getting the focus on labels via showing a focus rectangle around it?"
