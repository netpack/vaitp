"how to orderby on timespan field in blank? im using blank. i have a list of events: ..list&lt;event&gt; events = new list&lt;event&gt;();...and each event has a name and time. so if you were to look in the list you would see something like so:..event a | 18:00.event b | 18:30.event c | 18:45.event d | 18:15...i have been trying to make the list ordered by the time of the event but it doesn't seem to have worked. i used this in my controller:..events.orderby(e =&gt; e.time);...after looking online, i saw that some people user orderby and thenby, so i tried:..events.orderby(e =&gt; e.time.tostring().length).thenby(e =&gt; e.time);...but this didn't work either. can anyone help? thanks"
