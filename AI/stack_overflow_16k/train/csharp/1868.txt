"blank - startswith, endswith and between them string qwe = ""abcd"";..if(qwe.startswith(""a"") &amp;&amp; qwe.endswith(""d"")).{.    messagebox.show(""message"");.}...what i need is to make also a decision for b and c but not startswith and endswith, it's really hard for me to explain but just like this:..if(qwe.second(""b"")).{.    //do anything.}..and..if(qwe.third(""c"")).{.    //do anything.}"
