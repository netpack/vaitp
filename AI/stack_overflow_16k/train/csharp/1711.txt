"in blank - how can i take a specific char from a specific string, which is a part of an array of strings, and then replace it with another one? for example i have the following code:.. string sheet[] = new string[]{..  ""abcdefg"",.  ""1234567"",.  ""abcdefg""  };..while(true){..console.setcursorposition(0, 0);.console.writeline(string.join(environment.newline, sheet));  }...however, i want to replace 'c' with '#'. ..because the cycle constantly reprints the text sheet, setting the cursor position and overwriting the 'c' doesn't solve my problem. i thought maybe if i used the .. string.replace(oldchar, newchar)...function it may work. my question is: how can i select the specific string from the array and then the specific char?..edit: i may have asked the question a bit too vaguely. what if there are more 'c' characters in that string, but i want to repalce the 'c' in that specific position? it doesn't have to be it's first occurance."
