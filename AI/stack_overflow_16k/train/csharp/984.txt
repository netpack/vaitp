"byref issues in blank i'm having difficulty with a dictionary that i want to compare an updated version to the original version...the first method passes in the dictionary, then from there it gets passed to a static helper class that updates that dictionary...before i pass the original dictionary to the helper class, i want to make a copy of the original dictionary so i can compare...this is where i'm having trouble.  after the helper class, the 'copy' of the dictionary has been updated too...i've even tried making a struct that contains a dictionary thinking that'd copy the original dictionary values, but that seems to be by ref too!  here is a snippet of the code...public partialviewresult updateitem(string submit, formcollection collection).{            .    surveyitem updateditem = new surveyitem();.    itemsettingscopy originalsettings;..    itembank currentsurvey = (itembank)session[""survey""];..    string _itemname = (string)session[""currentitem""];..    originalsettings.itemsettings = currentsurvey[_itemname].itemsettings;  .    //this is where i'm trying to make a copy of the original settings...    updateditem = bankmanagerhelper.updateitem(currentsurvey[_itemname], collection, submit);  //static item now updates the fields in the item..    //at this point originalsettings.itemsettings has been changed too"
