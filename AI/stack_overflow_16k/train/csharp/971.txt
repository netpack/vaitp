blank backgroundworker reportprogress int32? i want to display progress from a backgroundworker to a progressbar in the ui. what i dont understand is why the backgroundworker's reportprogress function takes an int32 when the progressbar can take a double value for progress. my process is very intricate and i need to make decimal progress updates. it doesnt help if i have to keep adjusting everything to the nearest integer. can anyone suggest someway i can work around this?
