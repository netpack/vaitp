"ar foundation, multiplayer object spawn i need help for a little project for a job interview...they've asked me to develop something, with ar foundation and unet (it's deprecated, we know, but is just an entry-level project) on android...here's what i have to achieve:...track horizontal plane (done)..spawn an object on touch (done)..with unity multiplayer, the first device became host, others ar clients. when the host span an object on the tracked plane, clients see the spawned object in the same location, and when the host makes it turn, clients see it turning. position and rotation of the object must be the same for everyone, so clients can't call an internal function that makes object turn locally....now, my problem is to spawn the object in the same position and rotation for every client. i've read lot's of discussions on other forums, but i don't understand what i need. how unity track real-world position of objects? if i spawn a cube on the centre of a table, how can i tell other devices ""hey, in this location there's something, make it appear?"""
