"blank 5 extension method working as the blank 6 null conditional operator i have a piece of code similar to:..var colour = car.wheels[0].trim.bolts[0].colour.substring(0, 3);...unfortunately car, wheels, trim, bolts, colour can all be null; wheels, bolts and colour can be empty as well...is there an object extension method i can use that will do all the null/empty checks for me?..i'd prefer a solution that can easily be replaced with the ?. operator, once i upgrade to blank 6+."
