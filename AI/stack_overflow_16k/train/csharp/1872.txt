blank beginner - callback in the same function i'm pretty sure that is possible (at least in java it is) and i'm blank beginner...so i have a function which includes a callback (notify some other method that some work is finished)...i don't want to call another function because i'm losing a parameter there (and can't pass parameters in callback functions). how can i do everything in the same function?..what i'm doing now:..public static tween play(tween tweentoplay) .{.    return tweentoplay.play().oncomplete(rewindcallback);..}..private static void rewindcallback() .{.    // execute some code after tween is completed.}...what i actually want:..public static tween play(tween tweentoplay) .{.    return tweentoplay.play().oncomplete(/*create a function that will execute here*/);.}
