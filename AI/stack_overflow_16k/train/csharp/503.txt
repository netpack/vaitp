"calculate date with monday as dayofweek=1 i have this piece of code:..public static datetime calcmondaydate(datetime input).{.    int delta = dayofweek.monday - input.dayofweek;.    datetime monday = input.adddays(delta);..    return monday;.}...which works great to calculate monday date if sunday is first day of week. but i want it to calculate so monday is first day of week. because if enter 2009-11-29, 2009-11-30 returns back instead of 2009-11-23...how can i adjust the code for that?../m"
