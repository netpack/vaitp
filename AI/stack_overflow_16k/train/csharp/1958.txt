"how to return the updated string(array) after substitution i have an array of string (rows), every element of which has the same format: name; date; status..what i want to do is to replace the ""date"" with the date of today, here's the function:..private string[] update(string[] rows).    {.        datetime thisday = datetime.today;.        foreach (string row in rows).        {.            string[] terms = row.split(';');.            terms[1] = thisday.tostring();.        }..        return rows;.    } ...however the returned rows isn't the updated one but still the old one. is it that after the foreach() i should rebuild the array or not? any ideas? thank you"
