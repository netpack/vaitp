"zkteco biometric device -10054 error on connection good day,..so i have a blank project that connects to the zkteco time &amp; attendance unit (k30 is the device name)..sometimes on random when trying to connect i get an error returned from the sdk code -10054..this is my code i use to connect.. bisconnected = bmdevice.connect_net(ipaddress, 4370);...this is the code used to return the error.. bmdevice.getlasterror(ref errorcode);...i can't seem to replicate the error and there is no errorcode with number -10054 in the documentation provided. i can ping the device and telnet to the ip assigned with the port number, i can also use the device itself...to get past this i have to manually restart the device and then i can connect without any issues...tried asking the zkteco people but the person i spoke to did not help much"
