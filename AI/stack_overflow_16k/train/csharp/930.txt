"check dictionary.add() key uniqueness at compile time is there a way to check at compile time a dictionary's key uniqueness in a method scope when you add them with the add() method?..example: there are a bunch of payment solution providers (paypal, payex, etc.) that give some sort of a status result when you query a transaction, lets say an integer. since every psp handles statuses differently, we have a fixed amount of system statuses (such as pending, aborted, committed, etc.) that are mapped to the various status codes for each psp...public static class responsemapping.{.    private static readonly dictionary&lt;int, paymentresult&gt; resultmap;..    static responsemapping().    {.        resultmap = new dictionary&lt;int, paymentresult&gt;();..        resultmap.add(1, paymentresult.logonerror);.        resultmap.add(2, paymentresult.pending);.        resultmap.add(9, paymentresult.ok);..        // oh dear, this will blow up.        resultmap.add(1, paymentresult.something);.    }..    public static paymentresult findappropriateresponse(int resultcode).    {.        if (resultmap.containskey(resultcode)).        {.            return resultmap[resultcode];.        }..        return paymentresult.unknownresult;.    }.}...an easy shortcut would be to use the [] indexing notation to add each map, but with add() you can avoid possibly overriding something that you didn't mean to. ..unfortunately, this way it blows up at runtime. is there a technique that would make it blow up at compile time?"
