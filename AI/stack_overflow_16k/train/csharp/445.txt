"how do i make keypress event handler available to all forms? i've created a keypress event handler that prevents the entry of anything but digits, decimals, and backspace in any subscibing input control.  the problem is that the handler is only available to the form within which it was created.  rather than copying the event handler to every form, is there a way to make it global - so that the keypress event of any input control on any form can subscribe to it. ..thank you."
