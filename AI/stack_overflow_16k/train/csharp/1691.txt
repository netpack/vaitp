"how to make path strings in code file system independent? i realized that my code has a lot of paths of the form c:folderpathtofile, and i was wondering what is typically done to allow code to be usable under different file systems?..i was hoping there was some environment property i could check in blank that would give me either forward slash or backslash in order to create new path strings."
