"cancel a click event in showdialog form i am displaying a form using xform.showdialog(this);...this form has a button which has its dialogresult set to ok. now when i click on the ok button, there is some validation performed. if it fails i want the form to remain as it but but the form closes and returns an dialogresult.ok to the main form. so how do i prevent that from happening?..for e.g...button_click.{.    if validation fails pretend we never came here.    else some code.. return dialogresult.ok.}"
