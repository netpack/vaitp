transfer of control and data between c and blank blank main program needs to call a c program ga.c this c code executes many functions and one function initialize() calls objective() function. but this objective function needs to be written in blank.this call is in a loop in the c code and the c code needs to continue execution after the return from objective() until its main is over and return control.to blank main program...blank main().{.  //code..  call to ga in c;.  //remaining code;.}...ga in c:..ga main().{.. //code. call to initialize function();. //remaining code.}...initialize function() in ga.{.. for(some condition). {.   //code.   call to objective(parameter) function in blank;.   //code.  }.}...how do we do this?
