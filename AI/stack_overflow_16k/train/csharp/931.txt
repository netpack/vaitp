"move files that do not exist i need copy files from my local hard drive to an external hard drive.  my thought is, i only want to copy the files that do not currently exist.  i am sure there is a much easier way to do as such, but this is where my mind went first.  ..my thoughts on how to accomplish this:.1) get a list of all files on my c: drive and write to a text file.2) get a list of all files on my l: drive (backup) and write to a text file.3) compare c: drive text file to l: drive text file to find the files that do not exist.4) write results of the files that do not exist to an array.5) iterate through the newly created array and copy the files to the l: drive ..is there a more effective/time efficient way to accomplish this task?"
