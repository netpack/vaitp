"how to populate specific datatable column with values hello i have a datatable updatedvalues, and i was wondering if there was a way to set a value of the column with a value...int rowindex = 0;.foreach(string val in something).    {.    try.        {.        updatedvalues.columns[""books""][rowindex] = val;..        console.writeline(""went here"");.        }.    catch.       {.       }..    rowindex++;.    }...the try obviously won't compile because it has incorrect syntax, but i was wondering if there was anything similar to what is in the try."
