"how to find application data folder path for all windows users? is it possible in blank to find the application data folder path for all other windows users except the logged-in user? i have checked various options like sid value path in registry, system.directoryservices but none of them seems to work as expected...i also tried appending/replacing the username in the folder path using wmi code, but in some cases it fails as in those special cases the username is not the same as available in the folder path...please note that, there are no issues accessing current user application data folder. i need to find out the path for all the users (there is a difference between ""all the users"" and ""all users"") account currently available on that particular system (admin privilege)...please suggest a solid way to retrieve this information. thanks in advance for not marking it as duplicate, because the question is bit different than the other questions."
