"escape curly braces in string.format or string interpolation and a format specifier i have encountered a curious problem with string interpolation (also happens with string.format)...i want to create a string in the form of {x} where x is any number. i know how to escape curly braces, and it works as intended, but only if i don't add a format specifier. i can ""fix"" it by adding a space between the first closing brace, but that changes the output string...int i = 5.string a = $""{{{i}}}"";    // creates {5}.string b = $""{{{i:d} }}""; // creates ""{5 }"".string c = $""{{{i:d}}}"";  // this is what i want, but creates ""{d}"", not ""{5}"" because the first two closing braces are interpreted as one escaped one and d} is interpreted as a custom format string...is there a clean way to do this? (i.e. without hacks using regex.replace, or adding additional placeholders in the form of $""{{{i:d}{""}""}"")"
