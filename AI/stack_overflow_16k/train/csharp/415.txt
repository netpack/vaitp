"comparing readline to string or viceversa right off the bat:..so i am comparing if user is inputing a right answer..code looks something like this:..while(console.readline()!=rightanswerfunc()).{.  //wrong. retry..}..private static string rightanswerfunc().{.//smth here.}...so is there any difference between:...while(console.readline()!=rightanswerfunc()).while(rightanswerfunc()!=console.readline())...intuitively i would write the first way. it seems logical. but is there any real difference? or is it just a convention?.if it doesn't matter, then does it always not matter? (i.e. fine with comparing int32 but wrong when comparing other types)."
