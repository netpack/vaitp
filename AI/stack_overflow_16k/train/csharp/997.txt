"turning a string into an operator what i'd like to know is how to turn a string into an operator...i'd like to be able to compare one value with another, and the condition for whether it is true or not is a string. for example the string might ne '>' or '>=' or something else i can define like 'greater_than'...is the best way just a case or is there something better using all the wizadry of blank?"
