"using a child window from two different parent windows in blank my problem deals with the following 3 forms:..mainwindow.cs.settingswindow.cs.authenticationwindow.cs..settings window contains information like ""ask for password during startup or not""...i call the authentication window from settings window in order to remove password (when the password is set)...i call the authentication window also during startup (when the password is set)...my authentication window interacts with the settings window using a static variable(to say whether the authentication is successful or not)...but, in order to reuse the same code (that is, to call the same authentication window during startup), i am unable to tell the mainwindow whether the authentication is successful or not..however, i must some how reuse the code...my question is: is it possible to notify the child window about whom the parent window is? if yes, sample code please.....hope my question is clear. ..kindly help!"
