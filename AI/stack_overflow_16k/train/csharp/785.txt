"the name does not exist in the current context method i'm trying to create a program that pulls int's from a method in a class into another class. when its pulled into the main program, it is supposed to run through an if statement to only display certain values. in the main program class though, i'm getting the error that the name ### does not exist in the current context. if someone could take a look at this and tell me what i'm missing, it would be much appreciated. i'm having issues with the counter, die1 and die2 variables in the main program class...namespace diceroll.{.    public class rollclass.    {.        public void rollmethoddice().        {.            int die1, die2, counter;.            // create random number generator.            random rndroll = new random();..            // loop that counts the # of rolls from 1 to 100.            for (counter = 1; counter &lt;= 100; counter++).            {.                // random generators for each die.                die1 = rndroll.next(1, 7);.                die2 = rndroll.next(1, 7);.            }.        }..        public int getdiceroll().        {.            return die1;.            return die2;.            return counter;.        }..        public int die1 { get; set; }.        public int die2 { get; set; }.        public int counter { get; set; }        .    }..    class program.    {    .        static void main(string[] args).        {                .            console.writeline(""welcome to the dice rolling program."");.            console.writeline();.            console.writeline(""this program will roll dice 100 times and display the roll where doubles land."");.            console.writeline();.            console.writeline(""rolls that were in doubles:"");..            rollclass myrollclass = new rollclass();..            myrollclass.rollmethoddice();..            if (die1 == die2).            {.                console.writeline(""roll ""+ counter + "": ""+ die1 + "" ""+ die2);.            }.        }..        // key stroke is needed to close console window so results are visible.        console.readkey();.     }. }"
