"how to get time elapsed since program start? i am currently developing a blank application and i don't know how to get the program's timestamp...i tried using the following code:..public string gettimestamp().   {.      return datetimeoffset.utcnow.tounixtimeseconds().tostring();.   }..private async void form1_load(object sender, eventargs e).   {..      clipboard.settext(ts);.   }...but i end up with this:..1580565803...i expected something like this: (in the programs time from start counting up.)..000000.or.000050...so i could format it like this:..00:00:50"
