"datetime provider to using and mocking i writing unit tests for project and in code is a lot references to datetime.now. it's bad practice right? because hosting can be in different time zone as developing. ..so i trying to make a useful timeprovider to using in dayily coding and what can be mocked. ..i have made that:.. interface itimeprivder.    {.        datetime now { get; }.        datetime utcnow { get; }.        string timezone { get; }.    }.    class timeprovider : itimeprivder.    {.        public virtual datetime now =&gt; datetime.now;.        public virtual datetime utcnow =&gt; datetime.utcnow;.        public virtual string timezone.        {.            get.            {.                lock(this._object).                {.                int difference = datetime.now.hour - datetime.utcnow.hour;.                string timezone = (difference &gt;= 0) ? $""+{difference}"" : $""-{difference}"";.                return timezone;.            }.            } .        }.        private object _object = new object();..    }...what do you think? it's useful? can i using it in my asp.net mvc and console projects safety? ..is now theard safe?"
