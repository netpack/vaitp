"blank dynamic multidimensional list or array i need to create a list (array or any type) that would hold values, but these values would vary in size. i'm not sure what data type to use in blank. in php it would be something like this;..$a = [1,2];.$a[] = 3;.$a[][] = [4,5,6]; // this would hold any number of values.$a[] = 7;.$a[][] = [8,9];   // this would hold any number of values...the result would be an 'array' that could hold any number of values like this: see how index 3 is also an array that could hold any number of values. the same is for index 5...&gt; array (.&gt;     [0] =&gt; 1.&gt;     [1] =&gt; 2.&gt;     [2] =&gt; 3.&gt;     [3] =&gt; array.&gt;         (.&gt;             [0] =&gt; array.&gt;                 (.&gt;                     [0] =&gt; 4.&gt;                     [1] =&gt; 5.&gt;                     [2] =&gt; 6.&gt;                 ).&gt; .&gt;         ).&gt; .&gt;     [4] =&gt; 7.&gt;     [5] =&gt; array.&gt;         (.&gt;             [0] =&gt; array.&gt;                 (.&gt;                     [0] =&gt; 8.&gt;                     [1] =&gt; 9.&gt;                 ).&gt; .&gt;         ).&gt; .&gt; )...i tried this way, but it doesn't work:..int[,] array2d = new int[,] { { 1, 2 }, { 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 }, { 7, 8 } };"
