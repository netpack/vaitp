"unable to loop through documents strings i feel i am missing something here and i was hoping someone can point me in the right direction, as i have been unable to find the answer. ..i have an application that look through a document and when a value is found it prompts the user to replace this value with something else.the issue i have is; say the document has 6 of the same value which we will use $ it will only update the first value and then move on...document example:..    one $.    two  $.    three $.    four $.    five $...now i understand that a string is immutable but i would have thought there is a way to loop through the information, my current code is as below;..directoryinfo di = new directoryinfo(scriptlocation);.fileinfo[] rgfiles = di.getfiles(""*.txt"");.foreach (fileinfo fi in rgfiles).{.    fileinfo fileinfo = new fileinfo(fi.fullname);.    string script = fileinfo.opentext().readtoend();.    int dollarindex = script.indexof(""$"");.    string nexttenchars = script.substring(dollarindex - 17, 17);.    string promptvalue = createinput.showdialog(nexttenchars, ""input"");.    script = script.replace(""$"", promptvalue);.}"
