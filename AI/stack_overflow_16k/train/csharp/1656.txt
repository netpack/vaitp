"memory leak in tostring i wrote an application and it was working well. i left it running for a while and then took a look and found the memory usage had dramatically increased. after a long while i have narrowed it down to a function. i started a new project with just this one function in it. when i run that i get the memory leak...i have a timer which i start with form load..private void form1_load(object sender, eventargs e).{.    // for clock on ui.    system.windows.forms.timer tmr = new system.windows.forms.timer();.    tmr.interval = 1000;//ticks every 1 second.    tmr.tick += new eventhandler(tmr_tick);.    tmr.start();.}...then i have ..private void tmr_tick(object sender, eventargs e).{.    lbl_sync_time.text = datetime.now.tostring(""dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss"");.}...which write the time to a label every second. leave that running and you see the memory being used up i agree only in small amounts...if i add the garbage collector i do manage to get the memory to be ok and stable...private void tmr_tick(object sender, eventargs e).{.    gc.collect();.    lbl_sync_time.text = datetime.now.tostring(""dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss"");.}...i had a look on the internet and see @ https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/306822/how-to-improve-string-concatenation-performance-in-visual-c..i tried to use string builder but that itself gave me problems and the memory loss is much worse. ..private void tmr_tick(object sender, eventargs e).{.    stringbuilder sb = new stringbuilder();..    lbl_sync_time.text = sb.append(datetime.now.tostring(""dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss"")).tostring();.}...does anyone know how i can update the lbl_sync_time.text without a memory loss?"
