"how can this work (static extension?) i saw this in a answer by marc gravell, and i just don't see how it would work..static bool isnullorempty(this string value).{    .    return string.isnullorempty(value);.}...shouldn't a call to s.isnullorempty() where s is null, then return a nullreferenceexception?  how can you de-reference the object to call the function defined here if the object is null?..or is this some way to end-around monkey patching a static function?"
