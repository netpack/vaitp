"downloading a zip file from a url shows the zip file as empty when trying to manually extract it i'm downloading a zip file from a url and when trying to extract it manually just to check it has come through correctly it shows it's empty and doesn't let me. ..try {.     using (var client = new webclient()).     {.         client.downloadfile(""url"", ""c:/1.zip"");.     }.} catch(exception e) {.     debug.writeline(e + ""dddd"");.}...also how would i programmatically extract this so i can go into the contents of the file and extract more things. what is the simplest way?"
