"get the lissajous 135° curve in blank i'm actually trying to get a lissajous curve in a blank script for unity 5.....it is the 4th starting from the middle-left, the 135° curve. i already achieved the 45° curve, but i can't get it's inverted variant in my blank script because of this ""3π"" i can't seem to reproduce with mathf.pi...i tried ((mathf.pi * 3) / 4) and ((mathf.pi + mathf.pi + mathf.pi) / 4), but it didn't worked. the curve is not the one i want...here's my piece of code from the 45° curve i already achieved :..        float xu = 0, yu = 0;.    yu += ylissajousu * mathf.sin ((lissajoususwayspeed * 2) * time.time);.    xu += xlissajousu * mathf.sin (lissajoususwayspeed * time.time + mathf.pi / 4);...i'm sure it's simple but i achieved the 45° curve script just yesterday and it was the first time i was coding by myself...any help will be very appreciated."
