"blank list<[threedimensionalobject]>.find(""valueoffirstelement"") and return ""valueofsecondelement"" i've searched in vain mainly because i don't think i know what to look for.  i think i need to use the find method for lists in blank to do what i want, but i can't seem to get it right.  this leads me to think one of two obvious scenarios is happening:..1)  i'm going about this the wrong way (my money is on this one)...2)  i'm going about this the right way, but i just don't understand the syntax for finding something...also, just to answer some of the ""why are you..."" or ""why haven't you..."" questions:  if you can't tell, i'm figuring this out as i go along - and this is about the extent of what i've been able to teach myself thus far...here is what i'm trying to do:.first, i have a list&lt;fitheadercard&gt; object called headerblock. and it is populated by this custom type:..public class fitheadercard.{.  public string keyword;.  public string value;.  public string comment;..  //constructor.  public fitheadercard().  {}..  public fitheadercard(string fitheadercard).  {  // input:  80 byte string containing 3 fixed width delimited values..    keyword = fitheadercard.substring(0, 8).trim();.    value = fitheadercard.substring(10, 20).trim();.    comment = fitheadercard.(33,47).trim();.  }..  public fitheadercard(fitheadercard fitheadercard).  {  //clone a fitheadercard.    keyword = fitheadercard.keyword;.    value = fitheadercard.value;.    comment = fitheadercard.comment;.  }.}...the header cards are fed into a list when read from a file on my hard drive (using a binaryreader)...the fitheader object code is as follows:..public class fitheader.{.  public string headercard;.  public string headersize;.  public fitheadercard fitheadercard = new fitheadercard();.  public list&lt;fitheadercard&gt; headerblock = new list&lt;fitheadercard&gt;();..  //constructor.  public fitheader().  {.  }..  public fitheader(string _headercard).  {.    headercard = _headercard;.  }..  public fitheadercard fitheadercard .  {.    get; .    private set;.  }..  //methods.  public void addheadercard(string _headercard).  {.    fitheadercard = new fitheadercard(_headercard);.    headerblock.add(fitheadercard);.  }..  public list&lt;fitheadercard&gt; getheader().  {.    return headerblock;.  }..  public int getheadersize();.  {.    return headersize = //some convoluted math but it works!.  }..  //this is what i'm having trouble with.  public fitheadercard getfitheadercard(string _keyword).  {.    headerblock.find(""bitpix"");.    fitheadercard = new fitheadercard(fitheadercard); // clone constructor.    return fitheadercard;.  }.}...so the getfitheadercard method is supposed to take in a keyword, and return the the entire fitheadercard object found in the headerblock list...optionally, i'd love to just get the value back, possibly in a separate method, but for now, i can live with just referencing the value of fitheadercard.value..thanks in advance for your help!  i look forward to face palming myself when an elegant and obvious answer is revealed to this newbie .net coder!"
