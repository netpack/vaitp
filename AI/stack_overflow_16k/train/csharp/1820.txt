"replace "" with "" in blank string i need to take a string that was originally read in from a text file and prepend a backslash to any and all double quotes found in the string. i tried..string mystring = inputstring.replace("""""", ""\"""");...and even..string mystring = """";.foreach (char character in inputstring).    if (character == '""').        mystring += ""\"""";.    else.        mystring += character;...however, i still keep getting the same string back as i received (no backslashes in front of the double quotes)...in my example, one value of inputstring would show up in the debugger as ""div id=""loader"""", and i want the resulting mystring to be ""div id=""loader"""" as seen in the debugger...does anyone have any ideas on how i can achieve my desired results?"
