"sharing and adding to shareable code i know about sharing code using a class library(dll) but what if i want to add code to the class from multiple winforms projects? for instance in one project i created an excel class to fill cells from a recordset then save a file, etc. but now i have another project where i want to read files and the cell contents. ..this class currently resides with the original project but now of course i'd like to take that class and add to it from another project and still have it available for any other project. how can i do this?"
