"create additional thread/process for certain class wrote an tiny program which loops through folders on a remote ftp server, listing files and folders...when ever the program encounters ftp server's with a huge amount of files and folders, the program freezes (windows title bar of the program says, ""progress stopped working"")..in case the program still works, i can see it from console.writeline, displaying the current folder...after all files and folders are listed, the program continues working in a normal way..i guess i need to out source the class which does the recrusive listing, to another process/thread to keep the program itself work in a normal way...can anyone give me a hint how to do something like this?"
