is there any difference between declaring and initializing over return code directly? is there any difference between:..public customobject mymethod() .{.    var myobject = new customobject();.    return myobject.}..public int myintmethod() .{.    var myint = 1;.    return myint;.}...to this:..public customobject mymethod() .{.    return new customobject();.}..public int myintmethod() .{.    return 1;.}...does the compiler do something different? like null checks or something like that?
