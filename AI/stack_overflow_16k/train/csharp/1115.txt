"too many requests exception on httpwebrequest.getresponse() this is quiet different than the answers given on the other questions on the stack...i m confused why i'm getting the exception ""too many requests"" when sending a get request to the server . ..the request works fine on burp-suit/postman even without headers . and i tried to setup 10 continuous requests on postman and i received ok status code on all of them with interval of 700 ms . even tho in blank code i'm still getting this exception . ..any help is really appreciated . ..edit : .. var req = webrequest.create(""example.com"") as httpwebrequest;. req.method = ""get"";. req.useragent = ""mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 6.3; win64; x64; rv:56.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/56.0"";. req.accept = ""text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"";. req.getresponse();"
