"search in list of objects i have a list with customer objects and i'm trying to search for a name in each object. in the customer object there is a properties, contactdata, that return a contact object. and inside the contact object i have a method that  returns a string of a name. it is that name i'm trying to compare with, but it's not working properly, because i get a hit every time, despite i search for a name that don't exist in any of the customer object. the code i'm using:..foreach (customer name in m_customers).{.      if (name.contactdata.fullname == ""anna"") .      {.          messagebox.show(string.format(""yes""), ""test!"", messageboxbuttons.ok, messageboxicon.information); // just for testing  .      }.}...i have also tested to use a simple for loop, but i get the same result. i'm not sure i'm doing the right thing and would preciate some help! thanks!"
