"blank do while looping problems i'm new to coding and i'm really stuck on this blank do while loop business. after a long time of messing with it i finally got it to loop a statement, but now it just repeats whatever statement was made first. for example, if it generates the number 6 and you guess 7 it'll say ""too high..."" but then when you guess again whether you're too low or equal to 6, it will still say ""too high...""..thanks         ..    static void main(string[] args).    {.        random r = new random();..        int intrandomnum;..        // ask the random num gen for num between 1 and 12.        intrandomnum = r.next(10) + 1;..        //ask user for their first guess.        console.writeline(""i'm going to generate a random number, can you guess what it is? "" + intrandomnum);..        int intusernum = int.parse(console.readline());..        do.        {..            if (intusernum == intrandomnum).            {.                console.writeline(""you got it! great job!"");.            }..            if (intusernum &lt; intrandomnum).            {.                console.writeline(""too low! try again."");.                console.readline();.            }.            if (intusernum &gt; intrandomnum).            {.                console.writeline(""too high! try again."");.                console.readline();.            }..        } while (intusernum != intrandomnum);..        console.readkey();.    }.}...}..thanks everyone for the help! i got it! finally!"
