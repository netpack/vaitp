"invoking nonstatic methods of a class what (if any) is the upside or downside (performance, good coding practice, garbage collection etc.) of invoking a non-static method of a class in the manner below:..new classa().methoda(param1, param2);...as against the more ""traditional"" way of..classa classa = new classa();.classa.methoda(param1, param2);...any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."
