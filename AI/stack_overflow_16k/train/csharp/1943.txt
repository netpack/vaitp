"unable to create an interface for my class using refactor in vs2010 i have the following class and i am trying to create an interface for this. .however when i try refactor in vs2010. i get a message that: could not.extract interface. the type does not contain any members that could be .extracted to an interface. ..is this related to my defining the class and/or method as static? what i.do need is to be able to get this data without having to create an instance.so that's why i made it all static...public static class datasourceservice.{..    public static ienumerable&lt;datasource&gt; getdatasources().    {.        return new[].            {.                new datasource { value = ""0001"", text = ""development""  },.                new datasource { value = ""0002"", text = ""production"" }.            };.    }...}"
