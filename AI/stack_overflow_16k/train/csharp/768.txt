"location for a picture box and dynamic creation of user controls when i'm trying to set a position for a user control that contains a picturebox and an imagelist, only part of the image is visible!? what is wrong? for the location, i guess pixel is what i can use?..picturebox1.location = new point(10, 20);.picturebox1.image = imagelist1.images[3];...then i also wonder how i can create several user controls, like the one i describe above, during runtime, like some kind of dynamic creation!? i want to set different images and location for each user control. this creation should take place inside another user control and that contains a big panel. i'm not sure how i should do this and how i can communicate between the two user controls? just like passing values to methods and constructors af these user controls?!..preciate some help to solve this! thanks!..edit: i'm trying this code right now, but i cant find the reason why it isn't working?..picturebox1.size = new system.drawing.size(79, 91);.picturebox1.location = new point(10,10);.picturebox1.image = imagelist1.images[3];...i still get only parts of the image. and it's strange why the code below works and show 100% of the image?..picturebox1.image = imagelist1.images[2];"
