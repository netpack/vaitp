"need to extract a specific url from source code in blank console im making a bot that needs to display images from page links that are user fed. the only way i see of doing this is getting the href code from the source code ..using (webclient client = new webclient()).            {.                string htmlcode = client.downloadstring(""url that is input by the user"");.                console.writeline(htmlcode);.                console.readkey();.            }...is the current code that gets a url. if it helps, this query targets the card pages on the duelmaster wiki so the page layout is identical. i guess what im trying to ask is how do i get that code from the entire source code file?"
