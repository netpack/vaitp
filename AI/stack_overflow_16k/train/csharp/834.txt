how to save dynamic image from webbrowser control i am looking for some way to save dynamically generated image from webbrowser control. the scenario is i need to login to a website and then there is form containing user data plus one image that's been provided by server upon runtime. i need to process that data after scraping it. this means that i can see that image in webbrowser control but i can't save it cause it doesn't have any url. webclient doesn't seems to be an option out of the box due to login thing. i will have to implement state full communication if i choose webclient to replace webbrowser control? ..the only hurdle is that dynamic image and after brainstorming a lot i am unable to make any progress with it. no matter what way i choose i ended in dead end. i can see webbrowser control is showing that image so it must have downloaded it somewhere. but for some reason i am unable to figure out where its keeping that image and how can i grab it. i was even wondering to do a silent complete page save but then there is that windows prompt message. ..i would really appreciate some suggestions about this.
