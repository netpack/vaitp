"blank, copying files from multiple all subdirectories to one directory so i made the mistake of letting itunes manage my music, and now any song that has more than one artist is in a separate sub-directory.  i am trying to get all music files from all of the nested directories that itunes created, and dump them into one folder so that i can use a more competent program to organize my music (no offense to itunes fans)...i am aware of how to copy the directories to another location, as well as listing out the directories and sub directories as illustrated here..my assumption is that i would have to list all directories, sub-directories, and contents of those directories, and then loop through each file string...is there a way to get a list of all files (not directories) within a directory tree to simplify the process?"
