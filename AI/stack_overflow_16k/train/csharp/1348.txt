"save file and protect from user writes i would like users to add files to a program, in a windows active directory environment.  i would then like the program to save the files to a directory.  however i would like to have the files saved to a directory where the user only has read access. once the file is saved it is permanent and cannot be edited by the user, but they can still open it and save it locally with changes if desired...this would be like saving the file with elevated permissions...i don't think setting a read only attribute will do the trick as to my knowledge if the user finds the directory and file they could change that status manually.  i also don't think system.io.file has this kind of functionality...is there anyway to achieve this?"
