"quickly returning all numbers less than or divisible by seven so i had an interview question: write a function that takes a number and returns all numbers less than or divisible by 7..    private list&lt;int&gt; getlessthanordivisblebyseven(int num).    {.       list&lt;int&gt; returnlist = new list&lt;int&gt;();..       for(int i = 0; i &lt;= num; i++).       {.           if(i &lt;7 || i % 7 == 0).           {.              returnlist.add(i);.            }.         }..         return returnlist;.      }...so far so good. the follow up question was: let's say that call was being made 10s of thousands of times an hour. how could you speed it up?..i said if you knew what your queue was you could break up your queue and thread it. that got me some points i feel. however, he wanted to know if there was anything in the function i could do...i came up with the idea to test if the num was greater than 7. if so initialize the list with 1 - 7 and start the loop int i = 8 which i think was ok but is there another way i am missing?"
