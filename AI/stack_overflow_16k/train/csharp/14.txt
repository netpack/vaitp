"why dealing with value is faster than with reference for struct? it maybe unclear for me but, when i read the msdn doc and i try to understand deeply struct behaviour. ..from msdn  ..dealing with stack : ...  this will yield performance gains.  ...and : ...  whenever you have a need for a type that will be used often and is.  mostly just a piece of data, structs might be a good option....i don't understand because, i guess when i pass a struct in parameter of a method the ""copy value"" process must be slower than ""copy reference""  process?"
