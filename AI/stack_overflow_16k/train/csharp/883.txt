"how to split numbers from string in blank i have a list of countries in a string format like this:..123 usa, america.126 south africa, africa...i want to split country code, country name and continent and save it in a list or array. country code will have index[0], country name[1] and continent[2] in that order...i tried this:..string number = ""123 usa, america"";.string[] numbers = number.split(',');...but that only split the string into two: ""123 usa"" and ""america"", i want to be able to get the number part separate as well"
