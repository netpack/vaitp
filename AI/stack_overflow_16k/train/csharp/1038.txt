"blank search txt file for missing text and if missing add text i have combined the content of three txt-files into one and now have to do the final touch..i have managed to search for a comma and changed it to a dot. so far so good..but.....every now and then a line in that combined file reads ""length "" .(yes it is the word length followed by a space-character)..sometimes that line is followed by a number... but... if that line is not followed by any number or other character at all it should be added the digit 0 (zero)...how do i solve this?"
