"is there a way to make two checks on the same variable in an if without repeating it? for example:..if (tempcalculate &gt;= 66 &amp;&amp; tempcalculate &lt; 82).            {.                int tempresult = 1;.                return tempresult;.            }...is explicitly stating to check tempcalculate on both ends of the and gate necessary, or is there a way to tell the code to check it on both ends without re-stating it?"
