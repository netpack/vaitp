"add to screenshot mouse cursor in blank hi i have a function in blank to get a screenshot of poor quality so that the image does not weigh much, i have it all figured out but the problem is that the screenshot does not see the mouse cursor...the code is this:..    int screenwidth = screen.getbounds(new point(0, 0)).width;.    int screenheight = screen.getbounds(new point(0, 0)).height;.    bitmap bmpscreenshot = new bitmap(screenwidth, screenheight);.    graphics gfx = graphics.fromimage((image)bmpscreenshot);.    gfx.copyfromscreen(0, 0, 0, 0, new size(screenwidth, screenheight));.    bmpscreenshot.save(""test.jpg"", imageformat.jpeg);...as i solve this problem?"
