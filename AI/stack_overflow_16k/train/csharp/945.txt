"get date time hours and minutes with leading zero i'm trying to figure out the simplest code to add leading zeros on to the hours and minutes from the datetime.now function. i need to combine only the hours and minutes, and i don't need the rest of the date...whats the best way to do this?..my code looks like this:..datetime.now.hour.tostring() + "":"" + datetime.now.minute.tostring();...however i get data such as 16:4 for 4:04pm and i need it to look like 16:04. i'm familiar with the msdn articles on datetime formatting but i didn't see anything that addresses this specifically...is it possible combining `datetime.now.hour.tostring() + "":"" + datetime.now.minute.tostring();..if not how would i pull only the hh:mm out of datetime.now easily?..looking for least lines of code possible because this is something that i will be utilizing often..thanks"
