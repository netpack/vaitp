"how to change a property of a button according to the button that had been click? i'm trying to change the property of the button that had been clicked. i can't figure out how to do it based on the button that was clicked. i don't want to duplicate the method for each button...this is my code:..private void getplayerchoice_click(object sender, eventargs e).{..    if (playerx.turn == true).    {.        button1.text = playerx.name;.        button1.backcolor = color.fromargb(255, 15, 0);.        playerx.turn = false;.        playero.turn = true;.    }.    if (playero.turn == true).    {.        button1.text = playero.name;.        button1.backcolor = color.fromargb(96, 255, 40);.        playerx.turn = true;.        playero.turn = false;.    }.}"
