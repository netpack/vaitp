"how does clr manage when a static method is called? i have static class having static methods as shown below:..public static statictest.{.   public static void dosomework().   {.    /// do some work.   }.}...when dosomework() function is called, how does clr manage the function references as it is obvious that an instance of static class cannot be created?..what is the mechanism behind the scene to call the function in this case?"
