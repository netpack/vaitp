"cleanest way to check if a date is in a range (nullable date) what is the cleanest way to check if a supplied date is in a given date range?.for example:..datetime? maxdate.datetime? mindate.datetime? userdate...i want to check if the userdate is in the range.  where min or max can be null...so for example:..mindate = new datetime(2017, 1, 1);.maxdate = null;.userdate = new datetime(2017, 5, 3);...in this scenario userdate would be in the range since it's greater then the mindate and no maxdate was specified...i thought about using datetime.compare but it seems that i would create a mess of if/then statements to check userdate to the mindate and maxdate variables since the datetime.compare will only compare 2 dates at a time."
