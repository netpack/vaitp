"how to update a specific cell in a datatable based on search criteria in blank i am working with a datatable that i would like to update. here is what i am trying to do. i have a datatable with say 4 rows of data with columns such as student id, student grade and absence count...when i get new information about the absence count, i want to search through the datatable by the student id, isolate that row in the datatable and update the absence count cell with a new count. how can i do this? here is what i have so far:..datarow[] drr = dt.select(""student id='"" + id + ""'"");.drr[0][""student id""] = count;...but how to commit these changes to the table itself?"
