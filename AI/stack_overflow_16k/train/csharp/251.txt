why isn't the change to a field in an ienumerable executed? this was a surprise to discover that the following call didn't seem to remember the changes made to the field...private void foo(ienumerable&lt;blopp&gt; blopps).{.  foreach (blopp blopp in blopps).    blopp.somefield = prefix + blopp.somefield;..  string test = blopps.first().somefield;.}...the test variable lacks the prefix when the array is obtained using linq to data. i need to evaluate the ienumerable and make it a list in order to make the changes to the fields sustain. why is it so? i would expect the program to recognize that the field is used later on and evaluate it...private void foo(ienumerable&lt;blopp&gt; _blopps).{.  list&lt;blopp&gt; blopps = _blopps.tolist();.  foreach (blopp blopp in blopps).    blopp.somefield = prefix + blopp.somefield;..  string test = blopps.first().somefield;.}
