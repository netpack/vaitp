"how to change the text of a button with a method? i need to change the text of a button and i tried doing it with a method with two string parameters...public void setquestion(string a, string b).{.    a = b;.}.setquestion(btna.text, ""hey"" );...when i run the method, it doesnÂ´t change the text. but if i write it like this..btna.text = ""hey""...it works just fun. i am curious why the method doesnt change the text of the button..i know the method is useless, i just want to know why it doesnt work that way"
