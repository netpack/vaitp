"blank bonus calculator create a  bonus calculator program that has two overloaded methods----one that accepts the salary and bonus both expressed as doubles and one that accept the salary as a double and and the bonus as an int...i wrote the program and i can get the bonus as an int to work but both of them as double will not work..namespace bonuscalculation.{. class bonus. {.   static void main(string[] args).   { .        double salary;.        int bonus;.        double bonuspercent;..        writeline(""what is your salary?"");.        salary = convert.todouble(readline());.        writeline(""what is your bonus?"");.        string bonusstring = console.readline();.        if (int.tryparse(bonusstring, out bonus)).        { calcbonus(salary, bonus); }.        else if((double.tryparse(bonusstring, out bonuspercent))).        { calcbonus(salary, bonuspercent); }..        writeline( ""your new salary is {0:c2}"", calcbonus(salary,bonus));.    }.  static double calcbonus(double s,double b).    {.        s = (s * b) + s;.        return s;.    }. static double calcbonus(double s, int b).    {.        s = s + b;.        return s;.    }.  }.}...when i run the program with a double as the bonus it doesnt do the math. thank for any and all help."
