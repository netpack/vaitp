"dapper error when hosting application on iis7 i've started using dapper to connect to sql database. my application works fine when i run from within my blank application. application simply runs a select statement on a local sqlexpress 2012 database. it returns the required data. when i place my dapper code into a service and host the service on iis7 i get an error: could not load file or assembly 'myapplication version = 1.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publickey token=null' or one of its dependencies. the system cannot find the file specified...previously i used linq to sql for the same database query and it works fine when hosted on iis7. i expected dapper to work as i simply changed the code in the wcfservice.cs file and built the application..iis7 application pool is asp.net v4.0..any help appreciated."
