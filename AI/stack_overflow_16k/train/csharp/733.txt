"webmatrix dynamicrecord - get column value without knowing any column name of seleted table i got a thing to ask. i'm using razor engine..var data = db.querry(selectstatemnet) -> this return a set of data...using this :..foreach ( var row in data ) -> i get a row..here is my problem :..@row.columnname -> return the value of that column (if i know all the column names in table being selected)..so how can i do this :..var/string mycolumnname = columnname -> as i don't know all the column names, i have to get it from whereelse -> i have to do this. i don't want to use webgrid, because i don't know how to controll it...and i want this :..@row.mycolumnname...i tried, but @row.mycolumnname does not do what i want, it checked and saying there is no mycolumnname column. it's like i can't not do it this way. i must know all the column name?..i also tried : @row.@mycolumname -> this does return something like this : webmatrix.dynamicrecord.mycolumnvalue -> this case, the program just tostring() everything...i dont' want to use webgrid, as i have less controll...so what do i do?"
