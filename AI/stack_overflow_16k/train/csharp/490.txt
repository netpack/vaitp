"how do i delete a string from a text file on my ftp server i want to delete a string of a text file on my ftp server without deleting every string, and only the one the user enters. the code looks like this. it is for an licensing system to my programm. if the user enters the key, his hwid registers in my txt file and the key deletes itself. the other exe gets downloaded from the loader i wrote here, before the other exe start, it checks the user hwid and if its not on the txt file, it exits itself and deletes itself by an batch file....using system;.using system.net;.using system.io;.using system.threading;.using system.management;.using system.security;.using system.collections;.using system.windows;.using system.text;.using microsoft.win32;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.security.cryptography;.using system.diagnostics;.using system.linq;.using system.collections.specialized;..namespace junkcodeloader.{.    class program.    {.        public static readonly string path = .        path.getdirectoryname(system.reflection.assembly.getexecutingassembly().location);.        public static string read;.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            webclient client = new webclient.            {.                credentials = new networkcredential(""hidden"", ""hidden"").            };.            string keys = client.downloadstring(""ftp://hidden/hidden/keys.txt"");.            console.setwindowsize(80, 20);.            restart:.            thread.sleep(3000);.            console.writeline(""please enter your key!"");.            read = console.readline();.            if (read != keys).            {.                console.clear();.                console.writeline(""wrong key"");.                thread.sleep(3000);.                console.clear();.                goto restart;.            }.            else.            {.                try.                {.                    client.uploadstring(""ftp://hidden@hidden/hidden/keys.txt"", ""delete"", read);.                }.                catch (exception e).                {.                    console.write(e);.                    console.readkey();.                }.            }.        }....i would appreciate if one of you guys could help me out a little and maybe give me some tips ^_^..thank you guys for taking time to read all of this :d"
