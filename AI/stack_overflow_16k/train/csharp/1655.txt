"how to provide a reference to a member field in an attribute? this is a made up example so don't yell at me that this is a bad design :)..suppose i have:..class userinfo.{.    sometype1 member1;..    sometype2 member2;..    sometype3 member3;...    guid idindb1;..    guid idindb2;.}...each member is saved either in db1 or in db2 (not both), and for each member i would like to provide an attribute which would point to the variable containing the db id. something like:..[dbreference(idindb1)]...it this possible?"
