"calling specific namespace and class using strings i am currently writing a program in blank, this program has a folder called classes, many subfolders named a - f, and actual cs files within that folder named aa - cc...a-f are namespaces.aa-cc are classes...so if i wanted to invoke a method from classesbbb.cs i'd have to type every time..b.bb,methodname();...it will also generate two strings which will decide what we are going to be executing...string mytype = ""b"";.string myclass = ""bb"";.string toreturn = """";...there are many combinations of mytype and myclass so i've had to write a lot of if loops..if (mytype.equals(""b"") &amp;&amp; myclass.equals(""bb"") return toreturn = b.bb.mymethod();.if (mytype.equals(""b"") &amp;&amp; myclass.equals(""aa"") return toreturn = b.aa.mymethod();...this is quite a lot of typing and i feel like there is an easier way to do this since i already know what know what namespace i want to access and what method i want to call...is there any way i could do something like ..mytype.myclass.mymethod()...where mytype is the namespace, and myclass is the class i wish to call. this would avoid me typing out ever possible combination."
