"create instance of children using ""key"" i have a base class ""games"", and children clases for every game, with its methods making specific action for every game, but some functions are generic. i make the games class abstract, and every children implements abstract method or using the base clase generic method. every children have the same functions, but implements diferent in some cases. (i think this is correct way)..using system.io;.using system;..namespace appgames {..    public abstract class games .    { .        protected string name;..        public games(string name)  // constructor.        { .            this.name = name;.        }..        public abstract void show();  // abstract show method..    }..    public class gamewow: games.    { .        public gamewow(string name) : base(name) {}  // constructor..        public override void show()  //override the abstract show method.        {.            system.console.writeline(""name w : "" + name);.        }.    }..    public class gamegw2: games.    { .        public gamegw2(string name) : base(name) {}  // constructor..        public override void show()  //override the abstract show method.        {.            system.console.writeline(""name g : "" + name);.        }.    }..}...my problem its to create the instance of every children in the correct case, because i need to call the childrens function when one webservice pass a ""key"" (not the class name)..im using a switch, but dont know how to create a ""generic"" instance of the correct children and call the funcion later...update to clarify:..i need to call this some times, but dont duplicate the instances, if i call gamewow some times, i use only one copy:.. switch (game) {..            case ""wow"":.                classname = ""gamewow"";.            break;..            case ""gw2"":.                classname = ""gamegw2"";.            break;..            default:.                classname = null;.            break;..        }..        if (classname != null) {.          // create instance of the classname.          // if exists, use it, if not, create new.        }...thanks."
