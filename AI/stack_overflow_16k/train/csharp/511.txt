"blank -> webconfigurationmanager -> int32.parse -> input string was not in a correct format i have the following code:..&lt;add key=""host"" value=""localhost"" /&gt;.&lt;add key=""port"" value=""â€Ž44311"" /&gt;..var host = webconfigurationmanager.appsettings[""host""];.var portstring = webconfigurationmanager.appsettings[""port""];.var port = int32.parse(portstring); //exception here...it generates the following error:...  system.formatexception input string was not in a correct format....i have also tried with convert.toint32 with the exact same result. the weird thing is that if i hardcode the exact same value that is fetched from webconfigurationmanager.appsettings everything works.....i'm pretty sure i have used code like this before and it has worked without a problem. it happens in a async method but since i can see that i have a value when debugging i don't think it is related. from everything i can see i'm sending a correct value. what am i missing?"
