"ratios with datatable i have an application that i am making an have run into a place where i got stuck. my problem is this: how can i create a ratio with a datatable...ex:.my table:....|gh | gh | tf | tf|....|tf | tf | tf | tf|....|gh | gh | tf | tf|....my output:..4 gh:8 tf..anything could be in the table, so i was hoping to use linq to determine the ratio .. but didnt know how to find out all the diffrent results in the table."
