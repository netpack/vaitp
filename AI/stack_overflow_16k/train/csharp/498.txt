"random number generator that doesn't repeat itself i'm trying to create a random number generator between 1 and 500 that does not repeat itself. i made an array to keep track of if a generated number has been used but it doesn't seem to be working..if (drawntf[num] == false).            {.                labels[labelnum].visible = false;.                txtlatestdrawnnum.text = ""latest drawn number: "" + latestdrawnnum.tostring(""000"");.                drawntf[num] = true;.            }.            else.            {.                while (drawntf[num] == true).                {.                    num = random.next(0, 499);.                    if (drawntf[num] == false).                    {.                        labelnum = 499 - num;.                        labels[labelnum].visible = false;.                        txtlatestdrawnnum.text = ""latest drawn number: "" + latestdrawnnum.tostring(""000"");.                        drawntf[num] = true;.                    }.                }.            }"
