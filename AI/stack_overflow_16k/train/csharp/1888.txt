"seeing significantly more number of calls to a certain function when run on cortex-a9 as compared to cortex-a15 i own ms surface and samsung ativ tab. i had run the touchxprt benchmark on both of them and analyzed the performance. i found that during encoding and decoding of image (using windows.graphics.imaging library, blank), there is a function (xyzw_yzxw_32bpp_neon) that has the major usage during this process. on ativ it shows 32 calls to this function and on surface it shows 192 calls. (6 fold difference). i want to analyze this further and find out why is it happening. the krait cpu (on ativ) is very much similar to cortex-a15 and surface has cortex-a9(tegra 3). there may be a difference in neon architecture. how do i firm it up and say that neon is indeed responsible for this. are there any tests that i can run to confirm this ? i dont have any base in neon and i need help on this. ..the code for touchxprt and the underlying os is same..thanks"
