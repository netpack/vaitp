"double value in settings file giving wrong calculation results i've inserted a variable of type double in the application/settings file and i'm using a ""while"" loop to do a small calculation:..double final=0;.double cost = application.settings.default.cost; // 0.15.while(true) .{.    thread.sleep(1000); //speeded up version of 60000 (1 minute).    final+=cost;.    //code that waits for the user to quit the loop.}...the result after 1 hour should be 9.00 but it's calculating to something like 24.00 :/.however, if i hardcode the value in to the code, i get the desired result of 9.00..double final=0;.double cost = 0.15.while(true) .{.    thread.sleep(1000); //speeded up version of 60000 (1 minute).    final+=cost;.    //code that waits for the user to quit the loop.}...any ideas?"
