"accessing a control from a static non-ui thread? i am having a tcp client connect to the server. once it is connected, it should change the label to ""connected"". the problem i'm having is that when i create a thread, it's static no matter what...public static thread waitforconnectionthread = new thread(waitforconnection);...this means the method it'll be running also has to be static, which in turn causes me not to be able to access the ui controls. ..public static void waitforconnection().    {.        server.start();.        client = server.accepttcpclient();.        labelcontrol1.text = ""connected"";  &lt;-----------------.    }...i also tried control.invoke, but since i'm on static thread i wasn't able to get it to work. is there possibly a way around this?"
