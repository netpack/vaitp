"how to compare two strings with unicode have some diffrent? things happened so confused..i use these ..(cert.subjectname.name.tolower()) == (subjectname.tolower()...to compare tow strings..while i always get false even i can see these to strings have same value..then i figure out that, if i open the value in text visualizar, an select show unicode control characters.i found the second value has |* at the beginning....why these happened?.how should i make these two string return true to me?"
