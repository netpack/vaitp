"why method call on class level always expect static parameter? i have just written following two lines and got following error..error..a field initializer cannot reference the non-static field, method, or property...code..class sample.{.   public string number = ""13"";.   public int a = int.parse(number);.}...yes, i know if i declare string as static then problem will go away. but i am not getting why it is occurring."
