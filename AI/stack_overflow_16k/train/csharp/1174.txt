"search specific element in list from user input i have a list that contains elements. the user should be able to search for specific element and the list. then list should print out all lines that contains this specific element. why is this not working?.. car search = new car();. public void searchlog().    {..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; mylist.count; i++).        {..            if (mylist[i].model== search.model).            {.                console.writeline(""model :"" + search.model)..            }.        }.    }.console.write(""search for model:"");.search.searchmodel = console.readline();...it's working now! always something new to learn. the issue was my class variable. so i used variable from same scope instead."
