notify an observablecollection from one of the collection items i have a blank collection class and i want it to be notified when one of it's collection items changes. this is so i can then update all of the items in that collection. what would be the best way of doing that? ..i'm using an observablecollection because i'm binding the collection to a wpf listbox...this is my collection class:..public class shows : observablecollection&lt;showdetails&gt;.{.  ....}...and each item class is:..public class show : inotifypropertychanged.{.  ....}
