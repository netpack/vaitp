"blank function returns an empty document i have a wcf service that returns documents and images stored in a sql database. i am able to return all of the images with no problem. when it comes to the documents, i am able to return the document, but it is empty when i open it. the file size is correct when stepping through the code, and when opening the document it has the correct number of pages as well. just all blank...here is what i am using to get the documents:..string folderpath = system.configuration.configurationmanager.appsettings[""imagepath""].tostring();.. memorystream ms = new memorystream(bytearrayin);.. filestream fs = new filestream(folderpath + ""1"" + fileext,filemode.create ,fileaccess.write);.. byte[] bytes = new byte[ms.length];.. fs.write(bytes, 0, bytes.length);.. fs.flush();.. ms.flush();.. fs.close();.. ms.close();...i have also tried it with .pdfs and it tells me that the file may be corrupt and doesn't open...thanks for your help."
