"why does numberstyles.allowthousands cause an exception when passing a negative number? i'm calling the following two lines. the second line crashes.:..var a = long.parse(""2,147,483,648"", numberstyles.allowthousands);.var b = long.parse(""-2,147,483,648"", numberstyles.allowthousands);...however, if i modify the values to not have ',' characters and remove the numberstyles enum it works. e.g...var a = long.parse(""2147483648"");.var b = long.parse(""-2147483648"");...am i doing something wrong? is this a known issue? is there an acceptable work-around that doesn't involve hacky string manipulation?..edit i should have mentioned the exception is a system.formatexception, ""input string was not in a correct format."""
