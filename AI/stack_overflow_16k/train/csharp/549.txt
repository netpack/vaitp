"blank trying to figure out how to compare each item from my 2 list boxes, side by side i have listbox1 and listbox2, they each have 20 variables inside them.the first listbox has the correct answers, the second had user answers...i'm trying to compare listbox1.items(i) with listbox2.items(i) and if equal, give a checkmark, or +1 to the grade...but the problem is, i've read all the entries for .items, and was unable to find a way that i can select a certain one via for loops...my initializing code to create the members of the list looks like this..string[] correctanswers = system.io.file.readalllines(@path);.foreach (string value in correctanswers).{.    correctanswerslist.items.add(value);.}.string[] useranswers = system.io.file.readalllines(@path2);.foreach (string value in useranswers).{.    useranswerslist.items.add(value);.}...i'm thinking i might have to do the foreach again, but again, i'm not sure how to compare two of them at the same time... if anyone can help, that would be great."
