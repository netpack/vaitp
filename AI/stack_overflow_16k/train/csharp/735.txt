"how to stop multiple webclient downloadstringtaskasync i have a blank windows form application that contains multiple downloadstringtaskasync() statements an example of which is shown. i want to create a stop button to cancel the complete function. i tried adding the code of cancelasync but it stops only one statement at a time and then it proceeds to the next...private async void downloadfunction().{.  string s1 = await client.downloadstringtaskasync(url1);.  //do something with s1..  string s2 = await client.downloadstringtaskasync(url2);.   //do something with s2..  string s2 = await client.downloadstringtaskasync(url3);.  //do something with s3.}..private void stop_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.   client.cancelasync();.}...if i press the stop button which fires the stop_click function, it cancels the first download but then proceeds to the next. is there a way to stop all the download functions with the press of a single click."
