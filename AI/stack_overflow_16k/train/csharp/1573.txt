"make a long int easier to read i'm working on a fairly simple console application but i got one little problem. it's very hard to read large numbers unless you go close to the monitor and look very carefully. it's very important that the user immediately can see how much it is. for example, which of these is the easiest to read?..143000532.143.000.532...i want it to look like the second one. it's fairly simple to just do an if every time i need to print a large number but that's tedious and makes the code look bad. is there any way i can do this in a beautiful way and still be able to use the variable in calculations and comparisons?"
