"i am trying to maintain an image database folder structure i am trying to maintain an image database, so when i add a new image to the particular folder, my program should append old images. also, i am trying to delete them by using  string[] filepaths with the following code, but it doesn't work... ..can anyone please help me?simply what i going to do is if the file existing in the root folder(trainedfaces) or sub-folders(/trainedfaces/eladena/) avoid it's add previous images again and again....that is the point i stuck in??..e.g:- if i add face1,face2,face3 to the folder (/trainedfaces/eladena/). after sometime  i create another folder call linda in side root folder (/trainedfaces/linda/) and add face4,face5,in /trainedfaces/linda/ sub folder i only need face4,face5 but becoze of this for loop  it's add face1,face2,face3 as well so . in /trainedfaces/linda/ have duplicate /trainedfaces/eladena/ face1,face2,face3. i want to avoid this problem without removing the loop, if there is lambda/linq expression to do that? ..    for (int i = 1; i &lt; trainingimages.toarray().length + 1; i++).    {.        trainingimages.toarray()[i - 1].save(application.startuppath + ""/trainedfaces/eladena/face"" + i + "".bmp"");.        file.appendalltext(application.startuppath + ""/trainedfaces/trainedlabels.txt"", labels.toarray()[i - 1] + ""%"");.    }.    messagebox.show(textbox1.text + ""Â´s face detected and added :)"", ""training ok"", messageboxbuttons.ok, messageboxicon.information);..    string[] filepaths = directory.getfiles(application.startuppath + ""/trainedfaces/"", ""*.bmp"");.    foreach (string filepath in filepaths).    {.        if (filepath.contains("".bmp"")).            file.delete(filepath);.    }.{.    if (filepath.contains("".bmp"")).        file.delete(filepath);.}"
