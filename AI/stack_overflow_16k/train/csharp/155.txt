"split a string on '' character when '' is followed by a character which becomes a valid escape sequence         public void test(string userwithdomain).        {   .            // assume userwithdomain could be a console input or an ajax call...            // 1: userwithdomain = ""domain\user""; .            // 2: userwithdomain = ""domainuser""; .            // 3: userwithdomain = ""domaintest"";..            // (1) would work;.            // (2) would work too [this kind of input is not valid from within a blank app].            // (3) wouldn't work because t would a valid escape sequence and output would be ""domin"" ""est""..            string[] split = userwithdomain.split(new string[] { ""\"" }, stringsplitoptions.removeemptyentries);..            foreach (string item in split).            {.                console.writeline(item);.            }..            // how do i fix (3)?.        }...edit:..the code works in all cases but fails if this method is called from javascript like test(""domaintestuser"");"
