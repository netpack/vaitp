"using thousands separator in the code my code requires bunch of large constant values. the definition would be much easier to read if thousands separators could be used in declarations. is there any better way to declare the weight variables than conversion of a string (i.e. convert.todouble(""1,987,123.456""))?..note: there are many questions/answers related output format, but no luck identifying anything for the blank code itself."
