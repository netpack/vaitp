"constructor in a lib project unjustly accused of not having the right number of arguments this is the constructor:..namespace cdalog.{.    class errormessage : message.    {.        public errormessage(string application, string subject, string code).        {.            this.application = application;.            this.subject = subject;.            this.code = code;.            this.messagetype = ""error"";.        }...when i try to create an instance in the main project, like this:..cdalog.errormessage m = new cdalog.errormessage(logger.application, ""runjob"", ""main"");...i get this error message:...  error  17  'cdalog.errormessage' does not contain a constructor that takes 3 arguments...not quite sure what to make of it, there is only one constructor and it has exactly 3 arguments. i've tried clean and rebuild, it didn't help...edit:.i also noticed that other public members are ""inaccessible due to protection level"" and intellitype isn't displaying any members."
