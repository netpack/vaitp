"expression-bodied function members in previous blank i'm currently wokring with blank6 but need to go back to vs2013 for a project so would like to know if the following expression-bodied function member has an equal 'sugar' like implimentation in the previous version of blank:..public string fulladdress =&gt; $""{title} {firstname} {lastname}, {street}, {city} {zip}"";...title, firstname, lastname etc are all other properties that are initialised in the class before fulladdress is called."
