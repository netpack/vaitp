"why is this blank code crashing the process? static void main(string[] args).        {.            try.            {.                var intvalue = ""test"";.                var test = convert.toint32(intvalue);.            }.            catch (formatexception).            {.                console.writeline(""format exception"");.                throw;.            }.            catch (exception).            {..            }.            finally.            {.                console.writeline(""finally"");.            }.        }...according to me, during conversion from string to int, a formatexception is thrown. now inside the catch block, we are re throwing the original exception. why is this not caught in the generic exception catch block? if i put try/catch around the throw then application doesn't crashes."
