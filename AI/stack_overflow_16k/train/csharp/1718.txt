"doing something whenever an object gets disposed consider the following class :..public class someobject.{.        public string x { get; set; }.        public int y { get; set; }..        private void serialize(){}.        //when the object gets collected by the gc want to call the serialize() function.}...what event should i use for that purpose?..i want to call the function when the gc collects the object or when the application closes, but i want to do it from inside the class"
