"how can i quickly encode and then compress a short string containing numbers in blank i have strings that look like this:..000101456890.348324000433.888000033380...they are strings that are all the same length and they contain only numbers. ..i would like to find a way to encode and then ompress (reduce the length) of the strings. the compression algoithm would need to just compress down to ascii characters as these will be used as web page links. ..so for example:..www.stackoverflow.com/000101456890  goes to www.stackoverflow.com/ajks...is there some way i could do this, some method that would do the job of compressing quickly. ..thanks,"
