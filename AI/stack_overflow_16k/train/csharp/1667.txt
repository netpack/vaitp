"references in blank i am trying to implement a simple counter for a game. i want to be able to increment the fire, water and earth attributes using a method which takes a string and an int as arguments...i am however not sure whether the following would work. i am not sure the ints within the elements array would point to the original attribute of the same name or if it would just make a copy of it in the array...class typecounter{.    int fire = 0;.    int water  = 0;.    int earth  = 0;.    string[] elementnames = { ""fire"", ""water"", ""earth""};.    int[] elements = {fire, water, earth};..    public void addto(string element, int val){.        int keyindex = array.findindex(elementnames , element);.        elements[keyindex] += val;.    }.}...i want to be able to do the following:..typecounter counter = new typecounter();..public run(){.    print counter.fire;.    counter.addto(""fire"", 1);.    print counter.fire;.}...i would expect an output of 0 for the first print statement and 1 for the second, when i execute the run() method."
