"how to display a popup in the same window and close this immediately? i have a big problem:..i am loading with a webbrowser a website. on this website my program is searching for a button and clicking it:..htmlelementcollection classbutton = webbrowser1.document.all;.foreach (htmlelement element in classbutton).{.    if (element.getattribute(""classname"") == ""single_like_button"").    {.       element.invokemember(""click"");.    }.}...but it is opening a new window as an ie popup.  i want to display this window inside a form (for background work), and close this popup immediately after opening (because when you close the popup, the script on the site continues running)...any ideas?"
