"given a list of several of the same object, group and combine them based on field value sorry for the incoherent title. i don't know how to concisely explain my problem, which is why i didn't really know how to look it up. i'll explain using an example.....let's say i have a class:..public class cas.{.    public string name { get; set; }.    public int num { get; set; }.}...with that class, i make several objects and stick them into a list. for the sake of example, i will make 4:..var list = new list&lt;cas&gt;.{.    new cas { name = ""firstname"", num = 1 },.    new cas { name = ""firstname"", num = 2 },.    new cas { name = ""lastname"", num = 3 },.    new cas { name = ""lastname"", num = 4 }.};...is there a way to take this list and combine any objects with the same name field? ..so, the new list would be 1 object with:.. name = ""firstname"", num = 3,. name = ""lastname"", num = 7...there's the obvious ""long"" way to do it, but it would be clunky and expensive (go through the list several times to find like-objects). i was wondering if i was missing any clean way of doing it. i intentionally made a simple example so that the answer would be a proof of concept rather than writing my code for me. my actual problem is more complex than this, but i can't figure out this one aspect of it."
