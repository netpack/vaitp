"library to determine indefinite article of a noun? are there any libraries for .net that deal with determining the indefinite article of a noun?..my crude attempt is below, which will probably work for 99% of my usage (which is acceptable) just wondering if there are any established alternatives?..public static string getindefinatearticle(string noun).{.    if(string.isnullorempty(noun)).        return noun;..    var first = noun[0];..    if(first == 'a' ||.        first == 'e' ||.        first == 'i' ||.        first == 'o').        return ""an "" + noun;..    return ""a "" + noun;.}...update: eamon pointed out a duplicate question in the comments: how can i correctly prefix a word with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot;? i'll leave this q here and open though, because i still don't really have an answer."
