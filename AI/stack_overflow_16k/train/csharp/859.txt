"force one application to close when a different application has closed, then close itself so, i'm writing a program, here's the start of it!..namespace consoleapplication4.{.    class program.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            system.diagnostics.process.start(@""c:\windows\ehome\ehshell.exe"");.            system.diagnostics.process.start(@""e:\xpadder\wmc.xpaddercontroller"");.        }.    }.}...all it does is open the two files. what i want it to do is also wait until it detects when ehshell.exe stops running and then force another program (in this case xpadder) to end as well...i've had a look for code for doing this, but i'm not the best at blank and not 100% sure what i'm looking for!"
