"identify those characters which differs i'm supposed to write a program which identifies the differences between pairs of strings to make it easier for humans to see the differences...the program should identify those characters which differ between the two given strings in a visually striking way. ..output the two input strings on two lines, and then identify the differences on the line below using periods (for identical characters) and asterisks (for differing characters). ..for example:..atccgcttagagggatt.gtccgtttagaaggttt.*....*.....*..*.....the first line of input contains an integer .1≤n≤500, indicating the number of test cases that follow. each test case is a pair of lines of the same length, 1 to 50 characters. each string contains only letters (a-z, a-z) or digits (0-9)...but i cant change the matching characters to pointers? can i get some help? .and i don't really understand how to indicate the number of test cases? ..using system;.using system.linq;..public class program.{.    public static void main().    {.        string s1 = ""abcdefg"";.            string s2 = ""acceeff"";..        string s3 = ""hbcdfgi"";.        string s4 = ""hbadehi"";..            char[] c1 = s1.tochararray();.            char[] c2 = s2.tochararray();.            char[] c3 = s3.tochararray();.            char[] c4 = s4.tochararray();..            var diff = s1.except(s2);.            string news1 = s1;.            foreach(var value in diff).            {.                news1 = news1.replace(value, '*');..            }.        var diff2 = s3.except(s4);.            string news2 = s3;.         foreach(var value in diff2).            {..        news2 = news2.replace(value, '*'); ..            }.        string nr1 = s1 + ""n"" + s2;.        string nr2 = s3 + ""n"" + s4;..        console.writeline(nr1);.        console.writeline(news1);.        console.writeline();.        console.writeline(nr2);.        console.writeline(news2);.        console.writeline();.        }..   }"
