"httpwebresponse async the underlying connection was closed : an unexpected error occured on a send i m using httpwebrequest class asynchronously as shown in the code below (it's just windows application):..    private void startwebrequest(string url).    {           .            httpwebrequest request = (httpwebrequest)webrequest.create(url);.            request.begingetresponse(new asynccallback(finishwebrequest), request);          .    }..    private void finishwebrequest(iasyncresult result).    {.            httpwebresponse response = (result.asyncstate as httpwebrequest).endgetresponse(result) as httpwebresponse;.            stream responsestream = response.getresponsestream();.            int num = 100000;.            byte[] buffer = new byte[num];.            int offset = 0;.            while ((num2 = responsestream.read(buffer, offset, 1000)) != 0).            {.                offset += num2;.            }.            memorystream stream = new memorystream(buffer, 0, offset);.            bitmap bitmap = (bitmap)image.fromstream(stream);.            bitmap.save(@""z:new.jpg"");.            response.close();..            responsestream.close();.            stream.close();..    }...sometimes i get that error:..the underlying connection was closed : an unexpected error occured on a send...is there anyway to solve this issue?"
