"can't get the exponent operation button to work in a calculator i've been working through a calculator tutorial to attempt to branch out into blank and i've run into a snag. i can't get the exponent button to function properly. everything else that i've set up so far works fine (+,-,*,/) but i've tried 2 different methods from 5 or 6 different posts i've found about this subject and nothing seems to work. the issue seems to be there's a disconnect at the button level, but the button that calls the operation is coded exactly the same as the others so i'm not sure why it's not working. my second attempt is below...namespace cs_calculator.{.    public partial class calculatorform : form.    {.        string input = string.empty;.        string operand1 = string.empty;.        string operand2 = string.empty;.        char operation;.        double result = 0.0;.        public calculatorform().    {.        initializecomponent();.    }..    private void btn_2_click(object sender, eventargs e).        {   //set button 2.            this.box_result.text = """";.            input += ""2"";.            this.box_result.text += input;.        }..    private void btn_3_click(object sender, eventargs e).        {   //set button 3.            this.box_result.text = """";.            input += ""3"";.            this.box_result.text += input;.        }..    private void btn_exp_click(object sender, eventargs e).        {   //codes exponent button.            operand1 = input;.            operation = 'e';.            input = string.empty;.        }..    private void btn_res_click(object sender, eventargs e).        {   //codes return button .            operand2 = input;.            double num1, num2;.            double.tryparse(operand1, out num1);.            double.tryparse(operand2, out num2);..            this.box_result.text = """";.            this.input = string.empty;.            this.operand1 = string.empty;.            this.operand2 = string.empty;..            if (operation == 'e').            {.                double power = num2;.                for (int i = 1; i &lt;= math.abs(power); ++i) ;.                    result *= num1;..                if (power &gt; 0).                    result = 1 / result;.                box_result.text = result.tostring();.            }.        }.    }.}...attempt 1:..if (operation == 'e').{.    result = math.pow(num1,num2);.    box_result.text = result.tostring();.}...as an aside, i am completely new to blank and barely have an understanding of the syntax or flow. i'm most familiar with vba and so far blank feels completely different in almost every regard so please explain your answers in as much detail as possible as this will help me to understand them without having to ask too many follow up questions."
