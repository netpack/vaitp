"creating a scatter behaviour in blank hi i am practising my coding for my university course and i have built a virtual aquarium...i have currently got some sea horses in there and have made a chicken leg to appear when i click. i have written some code to say when the chicken leg appears they move vertically. however i want them to scatter and not go near the chicken leg or at least bump of it. my vertical swim behaviour code is:..` private void verticalswimbehaviour() //verticle swim scatter.    {.        vector3 tokenposition = this.possessedtoken.position;.        tokenposition.y = tokenposition.y + mspeed * mfacingdirection;..        if (tokenposition.y &gt; 300 || tokenposition.y &lt; -300) // responds if fish goes to the top or bottom of screen.        {.            mfacingdirection = -mfacingdirection;.        }.        this.possessedtoken.orientation = new vector3(mfacingdirection, this.possessedtoken.orientation.y, this.possessedtoken.orientation.x);.        this.possessedtoken.position = tokenposition;.    }.    private void randomnumbermethod().    {.        random random = new random();.        int randomnumber1 = random.next(1, 5);.        int randomnumber2 = random.next(1, 150);.    }`...i want to make a behaviour that work like this but runs from the chicken leg...here is my leg calling upon the behaviour when chicken leg appears..public override void update(ref gametime pgametime).    {.        vector3 tokenposition = this.possessedtoken.position;.        horizontalswimbehaviour();.        velocidadmax();..        if (maquarium.chickenleg != null).        {.            verticalswimbehaviour();.        }....    }...any help is appreciated."
