"trouble with single quotes in select expression the code is pretty simple:..string expression = ""user = '"" + user.username + ""'"";.int selectioncount = data.select(expression).count();...it works fine until user.username doesn't contain single quote '. for example, if user.username equal something like ""gul'mirka"" then app crashes. how to fix this?..actually user.username can contain anything, even only numbers (7548375982) or mathematical equations (1 + x = 4)...thank you!"
