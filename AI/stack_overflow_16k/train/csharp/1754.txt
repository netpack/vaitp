"reading specific columns using textfieldparser class in blank? so,i was using textfieldparser to read a csv file and get the result from it. but the way the data is being printed is a bit different. i get the data row by row. what i am aiming at is to pass the name of a column or column index and get the data from that column and store in a container so that i can create a table or something that i can append to a pdf file for report generation. this is what i tried so far...public void readcsv().    {.        using (textfieldparser parser = new textfieldparser(""t.csv"")).        {.            parser.textfieldtype = fieldtype.delimited;.            parser.setdelimiters("","");.            while (!parser.endofdata).            {.                //processing row.                string[] fields = parser.readfields();.                foreach (string field in fields).                {.                    console.writeline(field);.                }.            }.        }..    }...//i would like to get the data from column index 4, 7,13, 17,21. so, how do i get it work in such a way that i can query random column indexes."
