"smtp client , should my customers change it for their own? i am sending an email like this from my console app, the value for subject, smtp, etc.. as you see in the code are configurable from the app.config file so customer can type their own...     smtpclient client = new smtpclient(configurationmanager.appsettings[""smtphost""]);.     client.port = convert.toint32(configurationmanager.appsettings[""smtpport""]);.     client.deliverymethod = smtpdeliverymethod.network;.     client.send(message);...i entered my own smtp, port, etc.. info in the config file when i tested the application. now that the customer wants to run it, do they have to type their own port, smtp, etc.. or still can use what i have typed there and just change the recipientaddresses? ..note: it doesn't have to be an email address that they can actually reply to. the program just needs to send a report after running to their real email address. it doesn't matter if the sender email address is real or not."
