"how do i get a list of all connection strings in app.config in need to create an small console app, that takes two arguments:...file location for app.config file..passkey.my problem is that the console app needs to read the connectionstrings and encrypt it and then save the encrypted text to the config file. i have looked, but have not found any solution for it. ...my app.config file could look like this:..&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;.    &lt;configuration&gt;.     &lt;connectionstrings&gt;.        &lt;add name=""conn1"" connectionstring=""data source=database1;initial catalog=db12;user id=user1234;password=qwerty123"" providername=""system.data.sqlclient"" /&gt;.        &lt;add name=""conn2"" connectionstring=""data source=database2;initial catalog=db12;user id=user1234;password=qwerty123"" providername=""system.data.sqlclient"" /&gt;.       &lt;/connectionstrings&gt;.      &lt;startup&gt;.        &lt;supportedruntime version=""v4.0"" sku="".netframework,version=v4.6.1"" /&gt;.      &lt;/startup&gt;.&lt;/configuration&gt;...i have the encryption part are done. i just need to in this example to read those two connectionstrings and encrypt them each. please note that the name of the connectstrings are different every time, since the console app are triggered by tfs build server."
