"change a line of code in a while loop beginner in blank here. i was wondering if the following is even possible in blank...i have the following code that works (but does not do much as of now):..while (i != 10).        {.            i++;.            _playercard1.source = new bitmapimage(new uri($""ms-appx:///assets/card {cardsinhand[cardsinhand.count - 1].face}.gif""));.        }...now i have other image fields in my program named _playercard2, _playercard3 and so on. what i wanted to know was if i could have the while loop iterate through the different image fields using the i variable. something like this:..while (i != 10).        {.            i++;.            _playercard{i}.source = new bitmapimage(new uri($""ms-appx:///assets/card {cardsinhand[cardsinhand.count - 1].face}.gif""));.        }...i know the above code will not work, just wondering if it even is possible and if so how would i code it? thank you for all your help!"
