"how to fetch key value pairs from idictionary? i have a json file which contains some values like this:..{availableweapons:[ {""levelnumber"":1,""weaponname"":""axe""},{""levelnumber"":5,""weaponname"":""warhammer""} ]...using minijson, i have parsed this into an idictionary as follows:..idictionary weaponsgrid = jsonmanager.instance.availableweapons as idictionary;...i'm accessing this in a method that has an integer parameter ""level"". the method takes the parameter, compares it with each levelnumber field. if level is greater than levelnumber, the corresponding weapon is made available...pseudocode:..foreach levelnumber in weaponsgrid,.if currentlevel &gt; levelnumber. get name of weapon available at that level ...how can i accomplish this in blank? thanks"
