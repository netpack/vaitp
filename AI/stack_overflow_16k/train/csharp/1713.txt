"blank application encountering a problem and closing for no apparent reason. possible problems with 3rd party dlls we're building a blank application which will sit on pc's in garbage trucks.  things work fine on our development machines but as always, problems start to arise when we deploy onto our target hardware. ..one in particular is giving us headaches.  at random intervals we will get a windows message box popping up and saying that our application has encountered a problem and needs to be closed.  ..the application still works fine while the dialog box is sitting there, and obviously it closes when you click the close button.  the frustrating thing is we get no exceptions, nothing in any logs, nothing in the system activity log.  my hunch that there's some problem happening in a 3rd party library which we are using for gps, which is a .net wrapper for an unmanaged dll which we've had problems with before.  what options do we have to try and debug this??  i'm relatively new to windows programming and wondering if there are programs we can use to track which parts of a dll are being called by our code...cheers.nimai"
