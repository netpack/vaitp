"list mydocuments directory files strange output i'm using windows 7 and i'm trying to list all the files in mydocuments..i get the path with .environment.getfolderpath(environment.specialfolder.mydocuments).which is c:/users/eyalw/documents..now i try to list the files with directoryinfo.getfilesysteminfos(), and i get files that are inside the dir + directories from my user home, like my music, my pictures, my videos...i checked with the command line 'dir', and those dirs are not inside eyalw/documents.so why the hack do i get them?..thanks in advance!"
