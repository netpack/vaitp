"can i identify string [] inner value? i have a task and i have to check how many odd numbers there are. for example: ..cw(string[54]); //37 42 44 61 62...from this i need to get how many odd numbers are in this string. the only way i figured out was to cut the string into 5 ints so int 1 is 37, 2 is 42 and so on. but that is a really long and slow process even with methods...any help, or shall i stick with the ""cutting"" which looks something like this:..for (int y = 0; y &lt; all_number.length; y++).{.    for (int x = 0; x &lt; 5; x++).    {            .        cutter = all_number[y];.        placeholder = cutter.indexof("" "");.        final[x] = convert.toint32(cutter.remove(placeholder));.    }.}...this one is for the first numbers, so at 37 42 44 61 62 final would be 37."
