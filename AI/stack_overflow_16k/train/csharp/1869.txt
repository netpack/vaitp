"blank - accessing a variable inside and outside a class i wanted to access an instance variable from inside and outside of a class. i created a class like this:..public class test {.    public int a = 0;.    a = 3;.}...i can't access variable a from inside the class. but, i can access a from outside of the class:..test abc = new test().abc.a = 3;...it works. is there any way i can access the variable from inside the class and outside the class?"
