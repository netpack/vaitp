"change topmost property on a different form? so in my program i have a settings page. on the settings page, there is an option to set the program ""always on top"". when this option is checked and unchecked, it properly saves the setting, but it does not actually change topmost property itself...the program's main form is called ""mainform"", but the settings page is called ""settingsform"". how would i change the ""topmost"" property on ""mainform"", from within the ""settingsform""?"
