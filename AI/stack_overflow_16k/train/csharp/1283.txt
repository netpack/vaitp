blank class creation i just want to ask if it is possible to add a method within a class in blank?? ..like for example i have a form named sample form and then i have two textbox that the user should enter data. then i have a button that will save the data in the textbox into the database. but before saving it in the database it should first check if the textbox has a value or not. ..what i want to do is add a class and put there a function or a method that will do the checking so that i can use it in other forms also. how will i do it? please help me. thank you so much in advanced.
