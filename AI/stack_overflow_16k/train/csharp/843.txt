"console status bar i have a function that would update the status bar in a console application with the following  statement:..console.writeline(""status {0} copied"", i);...the problem with the above statement is that after a while, it would fill up the console line with statements stating:..status 1 copied.status 2 copied...etc etc...is there a way to have it only refresh one line so that the 1 would be replaced by 2 and so on so it doesn't end up  with a wall of text?"
