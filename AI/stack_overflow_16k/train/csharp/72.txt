elegant way to control length of string properties edit: the referenced duplicate is not an option as it was answered 5 years ago (and my reference 6 years ago) and i was hoping there was something more recent that did this rather than hand crafted work around code. nor is the referenced duplicate a fully declarative solution...i have a number of string properties off a class that are only allowed to be a maximum length. coming from a delphi background you were able to define a custom type as:..type tstring10 = string[10];.type tstring50 = string[50];...and then use that as part of a property definition:..property tstring10 mystring.property tstring10 myotherstring.property tstring50 yetotherstring.property tstring50 andthelastone...there appears to be no declarative equivalent in blank that i am aware of? so it appears my only options are:...write manual property setters or getters (that truncate to the specified length).call a validation method that checks the properties to ensure their length is as needed...or are there other approaches to enforcing a length on a string property declaritively?
