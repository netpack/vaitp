"mousedown event for multiple buttons basically, i've named my mousedown event to be lbtndown, and i've linked the event together with 3 other buttons. i want to make a switch case for each button when it's pressed down, it does something. and i'll also be making a separate mouseup event that does something when the mouse is released, but i'm already stuck at mousedown...i've tried almost everything and researched so many solutions however it doesn't work! i'm desperate as i have to submit this project tomorrow omg!..    private void lbtndown(object sender, mouseeventargs e).    {..        ///code.        switch (e.button).        {.            case btncfl:  .                txtbox1.text = '1';.                break;.            case btncfr:.                txtbox1.text = '2';.                break;.        }.    }...i expected the output to be for example when button cfl is pressed down, textbox1 will change to 1, then when button cfr is pressed down, textbox1 will change to 2."
