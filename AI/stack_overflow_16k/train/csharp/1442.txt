"pass user identity from ui to data layer in order to perform auditing on a sql 2008 database for updates / insert / delete, i was accessing..httpcontext.current.user...in the datalayer to pass to a stored proc which would set the context_info for auditing triggers...these is probably wrong because if i wanted to put another ui (i.e. winforms) the httpcontext wouldn't apply, however i don't want to add a username parameter to my bll methods or add a constructor as all these methods are static.  what is the best way to access a user identity in the dal?"
