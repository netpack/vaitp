"clarification about variable scope and event handlers please, consider this simple function:..public void beginfade() .{.    var fade = new doubleanimation(0d, timespan.fromseconds(1));.    fade.completed += fade_completed;.    grid.beginanimation(opacityproperty, fade);.}...the scope of var fade is the function beginfade and as far as i understand when the doubleanimation class has completed its task, the framework will clear the resources automatically...is this correct?..and what about the event handler? when i call more times beginfade() what happens to the event completed?..this example is just to better understand the underlying behaviors. of course i might declare fade as a class member and set the event completed in the constructor..."
