"returning the existence of a key in a dict by searching key substring i have a dictionary of string people (key) and string addresses (value). i want to have an if statement that returns true if any key in my dictionary contains the substring 'anders'. is there any way to do this? i have tried dict.containskey(""anders"") but that just returns true if any key is explicitly named 'anders'. i would like it to return true even if the key is anderson or andersen. i know this is a pretty strange case but i need it for a purpose...thanks"
