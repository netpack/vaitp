"when passing in an object that is going to be modified to a method, is there a way to indicate this? i have an object and it is passed to a method to be altered. this sort of behaviour seems quite rare so i want to make sure that other developers don't trip up on it and it's easy to see. is there anything i can do to make it obvious what's happening?..the method adjusts some properties on the object, but it doesn't return the object. perhaps it should return it?..myobject = processor(myobject); would be redundant, but it would make it clearer...?..the only thing i can think of is adding ref before it in the interface but not sure if that's a good idea or not. any ideas?"
