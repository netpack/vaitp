"directory.delete runs into ioexception i have created a shell script in blank that deletes windows home folders on the server. the home folders are given by a text-file. the script loops thru the folders and deletes them. i have two log files a ""success""-log and a ""error""-log...the deleting part looks like:..if (directory.exists(servershare + ""\"" + user)).{.       try.       {.               directory.delete(servershare + ""\"" + user, true);.               successlog.writeline(servershare + ""\"" + user + "" --- deleted"");.       }.       catch (exception ex).       {.               errorlog.writeline(servershare + ""\"" + user + "" --- error: {0}"", ex.tostring());.       }.}.else.{.      errorlog.writeline(servershare + ""\"" + user + "" -- errror: directory not exists!"");.}...now i run into an exception: ...  ""system.io.ioexception: the process cannot access the file because it.  is being used by another process. directory.delete pictures.  documents""....the folder was not in use (the users who access it, works no longer in the company), so no another process can access it...the exception occurs with folders my documentsmy music, my documentsmy pictures. so it could be do something with special windows folders?..the other folders are deleted. so the script ""works"". also no problems in local environment."
