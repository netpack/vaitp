"what is a private interface? in an interview a while ago for a .net position the interviewer asked me ""what would you use a private interface for?""...i asked him did he mean the difference between implicit vs explicit interface implementation to which he answered no...so i'm wondering:...what he meant?.what you would use a private interface for?"
