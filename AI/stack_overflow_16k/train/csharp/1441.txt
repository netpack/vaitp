"cryptography unit testing logic i'm relatively new to blank and i've just learnt cryptography (symmetric and one way hash). now i can surely create two methods that encrypt/decrypt text and they work fine. i encountered my problem when i tried to unit test the two methods. what do i test exactly? if i use for example tdes or aes to encrypt, there's not a single online encrypter that gives the same cipher text ( let alone that no online encrypter gives the same result of another one) for me to use as an expected result to compare with my actual result, so how do i verify that my method actually encrypted my text? also are there any other logical tests to run on such methods?"
