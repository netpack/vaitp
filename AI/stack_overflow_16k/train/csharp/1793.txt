"blank call derived class property using base class reference i have a class requestdetail. there are 2 classes classa and classb derived from it such that each of them has their own property:..public partial classa : requestdetail { ..... }.public partial classb : requestdetail { ..... }...i am writing a method createmethod1(classa a) and createmethod2(classb b)...both methods doing the same stuff except some minor difference. i would like to write a generic method and call that method by passing the reference in createmethod1 and createmethod2...can anyone help me in doing this?..thanks..edit:..what i have excluded is i have received a wsdl which when generated gives me four separate classes that inherit from a base class with around 20 properties. they only differ very slightly, to be exact 2 classes contain the same field (isurgent), the third contains (ticket and reason) and the fourth contains (budgetcode) the persistance however is exactly the same for all implementations. i dont want to create 4 seperate methods to persist the same information...its worth noting the classes are partial...xsd looks like following..&lt;xs:complextype name=""classa""&gt;.    &lt;xs:complexcontent&gt;.      &lt;xs:extension base=""iarequestdetails""&gt;.        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;.          &lt;xs:element name=""isurgent"" type=""iaurgency""/&gt;.        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;.      &lt;/xs:extension&gt;.    &lt;/xs:complexcontent&gt;.  &lt;/xs:complextype&gt;..  &lt;xs:complextype name=""classb""&gt;.    &lt;xs:complexcontent&gt;.      &lt;xs:extension base=""iarequestdetails""&gt;.        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;.          &lt;xs:element name=""budgetcode"" type=""projectbudgetcode""/&gt;.          &lt;xs:element name=""isurgent"" type=""iaurgency""/&gt;.        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;.      &lt;/xs:extension&gt;.    &lt;/xs:complexcontent&gt;.  &lt;/xs:complextype&gt;"
