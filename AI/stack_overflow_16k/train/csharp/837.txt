"how do i build a timer that executes some code in intervals? i have an application where it is possible for the user to schedule some taske. a task could be to ""send email"", ""execute application"" etc. each of these tasks has a start time, and this varies. some of these tasks should run from the start time of the task to the stat time of the next task...my question is how do i build a timer that will allow this to happen. usually i would do this using a backgroundworker and an infinite loop - then check the time and the schedules each second or so. the problem with this approach is that when i close my application, the background worker is not closed...any ideas on a better pattern for this timer, or for solving the thread issue?"
