"is it possible to assign a value to a const variable when creating an object? i am creating a client for a webrequesttool which contains a token that is used throughout the lifetime of each object but is unique to each entity of the class. since i do not want that value to be changeable after an object is created, i would like it to be constant. ..i already tried using an internal setmethod which is called from the constructor like : ..internal void settoken(string token).{.    this.token = token; .}...i also tried just assigning it inside the constructor. that is also not working...public class client.{.    const token; ..    public client(string token).    {.      this.token = token;.    }.}...is there really no other way of assigning a constant than hardcoding it when declaring it? and if there is what is it ?"
