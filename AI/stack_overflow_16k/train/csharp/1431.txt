"why is a private variable defined in for conflict with the same variable outside? in my mental model, counter variables defined inside for become private because it cannot be access from outside as follows...    for (int x = 0; x &lt; 2; x++) ;.    //console.writeline(x); x does not exist in the current context...my confusion occurs when i declared the same variable as follows,..    for (int x = 0; x &lt; 2; x++) ;.    //console.writeline(x); x does not exist in the current context, but why cannot i declare.    //int x = 1;...why does the compiler disallow me to declare a variable with the same name as another inaccessible variable? it does not make sense to me. :-)..to make more confusing compare it with..    {.        int x = 1;.    }.    {.        int x = 2;.    }...which is allowed by the compiler. but both below are not allowed...static void foo().{.    int x = 1;.    { int x = 2; }.}..static void bar().{.    { int x = 2; }.    int x = 3;.}"
