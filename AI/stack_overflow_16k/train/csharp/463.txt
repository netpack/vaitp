"merge two programs and using output of 1 as input to another i am trying to merge two programs, using output of one as an input to other. .    program # 1 ends up writing the output and program 2 wants user input both using console. i don't want result of program 1 to be shown as output but rather used as input so that program 2 doesn't ask for user input...    foreach (var item in result).               {.                    console.write(item);.               }.               console.readline(); ...**end of program 1**....**program 2**..console.writeline(""please, enter numbers"");..var numbersstr = console.readline();..if (!string.isnullorempty(numbersstr)).        {.            numbersstr = numbersstr.trim();..and program continues"
