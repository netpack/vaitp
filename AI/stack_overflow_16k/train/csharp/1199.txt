"what's a clean way to pass back groups of class instances without creating additional 'transaction' classes? to explain, every method in an api has to return an instance of a result class along with any other objects passed back...if i have two classes i want to pass back as single items and lists:..public class foo.{.}..public class bar.{.}...that would mean i need four transaction classes to pass back:..public class result.{.}..public class apifoo.{.    public result result;.    public foo foo;.}..public class apifoolist.{.    public result result;.    public list&lt;foo&gt; foolist;.}..public class apibar.{.    public result result;.    public bar bar;.}..public class apibarlist.{.    public result result;.    public list&lt;bar&gt; barlist;.}...i'm sure there must be a better way to pass back the correct collections than this...can anyone advise a better way?..thanks."
