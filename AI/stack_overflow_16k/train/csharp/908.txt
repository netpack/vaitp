"websites for different regions i have got a requirement from a client. they need three blogging web application for three different regions. each application have its own data and posts. probably they want to share user information between these applications. user interface of these application will be same except css level changes (color, font and styles) and little bit layout changes in home page for each blog. that brought lot of questions to my mind. ..three seperate site approah.1. is that good to develop three different websites for each region and deploy them in three subdomains?.2. am i going to use same database or individual database for each region?.3. if there are three web sites, how am i going to overcome caching, session sharing and user signon(single sign-on), multiple deployment, duplication of code issue?..single site approach.1. create a single site, seperate the regions like sitename/regionname?.2. if it is single site, how the performance and scalability is going to be?.3. just use singe database, that would be shared between three regions. is that good approach?..there could be many more possiblities. now i need your guidance that what are all other unknown problems would occur and how would i approach this problem one by one and come to a conclusion that which is best?..we may implement this solution in blank...edit: the sites will be in english language"
