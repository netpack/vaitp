is it possible to access properties of a subclass if the object's reference variable is a superclass type? i am new to programming and to blank and i just wanna know if there is a way for me to initialize the subclass fields through property if my reference variable is a superclass type...example ..character test = new archer();.test.damage = 5; // damage is from the fighter class...superclass character..abstract class character.{.//superclass common.}...class fighter subclass of character..abstract class fighter : character.{.    private int damage.    public int damage {.        get.        {.            return damage;.        }.        set.        {.            damage = value;.        }.    }.}...class archer subclass of fighter..class archer : fighter.{.//stuffs that only archers can do.}
