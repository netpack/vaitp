"print a star (*) right triangle in blank i have already done this with a nested for loop but, i also want to know how to do this with a while loop. i already have this .. int j = 10;.     int k = 0;.     while (j &gt; 0).     {.        if (k &lt;= j).        {.           console.write(""* "");.           console.writeline();.        }.        j--;.     } console.writeline();...and it prints out a line of stars(*). i know the inner loop has to refer to the outer loop but i'm not sure how to do this in a while statement."
