"why does '+' + a short convert to 44 i have a line of code that looks like this:..myobject.phonenumber = '+' + thephoneprefix + thebiznumber;...basically, i'm creating a phone number in e164 format and then i assign that string to a string property of an object. thephoneprefix is a short that holds the international phone prefix and thebiznumber is a string that holds the phone number digits...why didn't the compiler bug when i was concatenating a short in the string in the first place? and then why does '+' + 1 equal 44?? this was a pretty hard bug to track because there was no compile error and 44 is the phone prefix for the uk so everything ""looked"" like it was working because the client-side code just saw a uk number. why 44?"
