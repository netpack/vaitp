"overloaded versions of writeline; why not use generics/template? .  the system.console type offers several overloaded versions of the writeline method (boolean, char, int32)...so basically the sentence is saying when implementing writeline for different primitive types, they overloaded the function a couple of times..instead of writing so many functions for different types, why don't they use generics / templating ?..if it is in c++, i would assume templating in such scenarios are better solutions compared with overloaded versions of similar functions. don't know the incentive here...next line:.for the sole purpose of reducing number of boxing operations for the common value types .....how does these reduce boxing count then? constructing the string directly instead of calling tostring ?"
