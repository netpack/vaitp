"selecting a value to decode hex string in pdf while we have a hexadecimal string, how to convert the hex string as it matches the characters in charactermap table. i have tried splitting the hex string as consecutive two character codes and then get the decoded values using system.globalization.numberstyles.hexnumber. but some times it goes wrong and in those cases the above logic fails converting the hex string as four character sub strings and decoding it produces good result...for example:..in the case: hex string &lt;030402&gt; converted to substrings 03,04 and 02 and then decoding  the substrings produces correct result...in the case: hex string &lt;0000&gt; converted as 00,00 and then decoding  the substrings  produces incorrect result. in this case converting the hex sting as a whole 0000 to hexadecimal produces correct result...could anyone help me with this. thanks in advance."
