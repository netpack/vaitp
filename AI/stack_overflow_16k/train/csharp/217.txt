use yield in for loop i have such function to read large txt files..private static ienumerable&lt;string&gt; readlinefromfile(textreader filereader).        {.            using (filereader).            {.                string currentline;.                while ((currentline = filereader.readline()) != null).                {.                    yield return currentline;.                }.            }.        }...yield can be used only in foreach loop...textreader readfile = new streamreader(file_path);.foreach (string url in readlinefromfile(readfile)).{.}...i need to re-write this function to use it with for loop. to state with iterator the line to read..i tried something but my attempts were unsuccessful.any ideas?
