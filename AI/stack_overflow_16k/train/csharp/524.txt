"best approach to pass information to a function what is the best approach to pass information to a function? should we pass a list of parameters? or we should create a class and just pass the instance of that class, so that whenever, there's a change in the parameter list we don't have to change all the flow?..passing the class variable:..public class fooparams.{.    string name{get;set;}.    string password{get;set;}.}..public void getfoo(foo foo).{.}...passing a list of parameters..public void getfoo(string name, string password).{.}"
