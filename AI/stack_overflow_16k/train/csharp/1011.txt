"how to create variables accessible with intellisense in blank i am starting to work with blank and am still learning the basics..i've got a few different classes:..public class companya{}.public class companyb{}.......i need to define adult, child and infant ages for each company in such a way that i could then access those ""int"" values with intellisense, and where i can initialize the 'maxage' and 'minage' for each of them. i believe it would be something along the lines of:..companya.adult.minage.companyb.infant.maxage...could you please provide an example of how i can achieve this? i need to create other similar structures, so having a working example would help me a lot...thank you."
