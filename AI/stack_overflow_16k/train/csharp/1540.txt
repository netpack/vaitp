"how do i match varying postal addresses? i have a requirement to match u.s. postal addresses during an import process.  the problem is the address line could be typed in several different ways.  example:..123 main street..123 main st...123 main st..how do i standardize an address so that i can do matching?  we are importing 10,000 addresses at a time so i don't want to use a service like google, yahoo, or usps.  is there an open source or commercial library for address standardization that is not a com component?  i don't care if the address is real or not, all i care about is the matching."
