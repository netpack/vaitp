"does the outer class's main method gets called by default in a nested class? if i have the following code:..class outer.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.    }..    class inner.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.        }.    }.}...the by default, which main method would be executed, would it be the main method of the outer class? ..also, another question is, what is the difference between a nested inner class and an internal class in blank?"
