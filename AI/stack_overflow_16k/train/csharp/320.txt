"the difference between (sender as) and (new) in blank i'm new in blank, these days i'm studying this tutorial from msdn.microsoft.com (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd492172.aspx), ..a part of this tutorial there is a statement to make a new object as think but i'm not sure for a numeric up down control, and the statement is:..numericupdown answerbox = sender as numericupdown; ...and it's on this page .(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd492138.aspx)..the question is, what is the difference between these two statements?, and what both mean...numericupdown answerbox = sender as numericupdown;...and..numericupdown answerbox = new numericupdown();...thank you in advance."
