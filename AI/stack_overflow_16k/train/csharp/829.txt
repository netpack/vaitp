"is this matching from scala is available in blank? i found nice little one example of scala today. something like:..(1 to 100) map { x =&gt;   .  (x % 2, x % 6) match {  .    case (0,0) =&gt; ""first"".    case (0,_) =&gt; ""second""    .    case (_,0) =&gt; ""third""    .    case _ =&gt; x tostring    .  }.} foreach println...and i wonder if i could do something similar in blank. i tried to search on my own but it's hard since i don't know name of this expression. it seems pretty useful. so can i do this in blank?"
