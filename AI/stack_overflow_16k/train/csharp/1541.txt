"how can i restrict the type of data my users enter at the class level i have the following class:..public class reference : auditabletable.{.     [range(0, 99, errormessage = ""{0} must be between {1} and {2}"")].     [displayname(""order"")].     public int order { get; set; .}...with mvc the range check should stop the user entering bad data. however my other code that does not go through the mvc front end allows me to enter in values like 999. is it normal to have checking at the class level for this and how could i implement it ?"
