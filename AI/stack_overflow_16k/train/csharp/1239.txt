"hashset<string>contains for collection i am comparing 2 hashsets full of filenames.i have successfully implemented ""exceptwith"" but now i need to get a list of ""all filenames that are in both sets.""..i know hashset has a contains but that means looping the hashset for each item of the other one..wondering if there is an inbuilt method to do this..i am doing with files with over 50000 filenames...many thanks"
