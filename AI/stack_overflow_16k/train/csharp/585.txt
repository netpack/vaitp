"how can i update the progress bar in window application from another class? i have created one windows form, there i have a progress bar, i want to update the value of progress bar, from another class. i have written one function in my class on its execution, i want to see the progress in progress bar...for example:...the code written in forms .cs file:..... namespace updateprogressbar.{.    public partial class progressbarudpate : form.    {.        public progressbarudpate().        {.            initializecomponent();.        }..        private void btn_submit_click(object sender, eventargs e).        {.            updatedataprogress updt = new updatedataprogress();.            updt.executefucntion();.        }.    }.}....the code written in another class.....namespace updateprogress.{.    public class updatedataprogress.    {.        public void executefucntion().        {.            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++).            {..            }..        }.    }.}...my expected output is when i call updt.executefucntion function it should update the progressbar values as per loop implemented in another class."
