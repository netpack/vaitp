"can not load my own file or assembly i have created two projects in one solution and the idea is that i want to have one project call a method in the other project. i have added the called project as a reference to the calling project, but when i try to run the code i get this error:...  additional information: could not load file or assembly 'abc,.  version=9.8.0.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=4f047e93159395ca' or.  one of its dependencies. the located assembly's manifest definition.  does not match the assembly reference. (exception from hresult:.  0x80131040)...when i paste the main method that is calling the method from the other project into the called project and only run that one it works fine. so it is likely not a problem with dependencies."
