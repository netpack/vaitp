"one array calling another one's methods i will try to ask the best way i can....i have ..let's say 5 instances of chunks in my map class.the chunks instances contain array  of point struct data...now what i am trying to achieve is to hold this point data in the chunks..but i want to.have them also sorted in the map class in one array and access them through static array...i want to call the chunk instances methods through another array in the map class like:..""call:"" map.points[13,2,1].destroy() ""which is directly calling: "" => chunk[1].points[13,2,1].destroy()..""call:"" map.points[53,24,1].destroy() ""which is directly calling: "" => chunk[1].points[12,12,1].destroy()..so i just need straight access through another array.is there any way to achieve this?"
