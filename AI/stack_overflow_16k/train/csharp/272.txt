"polymorphism - exercise alright, so this is the exercise: ...  define a class named student,.  containing three grades of students..  the class will have a function that.  calculates the grades average. now,.  define a class named student1 which.  will be derived from student and will.  add a function to calculate the sum of.  the grades.in the main program, define.  a student variable and object of type.  student1. perform placement of the.  object to variable and run the.  function of student1....note: this is not homework, i'm learning this my own..this is the code: ..class student.{.    protected int grade1, grade2, grade3;.    public student(int grade1, int grade2, int grade3).    {.        this.grade1 = grade1;.        this.grade2 = grade2;.        this.grade3 = grade3;.    }.    public double average().    {.        return (grade1 + grade2 + grade3) / 3;.    }.}.class student1 : student.{.    public student1(int grade1, int grade2, int grade3).        : base(grade1, grade2, grade3).    {.    }.    public double sum().    {.        return grade1 + grade2 + grade3;.    }.}.class program.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.    }.}...i don't really know what to do in the main class, how do i perform this placement and also, i wanted to know what's the benefit of doing it, let me know if i have mistakes so far, thanks alot."
