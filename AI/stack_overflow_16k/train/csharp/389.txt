"how to calculate sin using system.data.compute() in blank i'm new here! i'm a newbie in blank. one of my friends challenged me to create scientific calculator. i searched and found an easy way to make it here - using the system.data library. for an example we have this:..string math = ""5 + 3 * 3"";.string answer = new datatable().compute(math, null).tostring();...this worked pretty easy with basic expressions, but i can't seem to find a way how to make the calculator be able to calculate sin, cos e.t.c. anybody has an idea?..ps: i'm not good in english so plz forgive me"
