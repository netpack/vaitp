"blank event deadlocks i got this:..object locker = new object(); // edit: sorry, omitted for simplicity. lock(this) is not the source of the problem..private something property;.public event somethinghandler propertychanged;..public something property.{.    get {.        lock (locker) {.            return property;.        }.    }..    set {.        lock (locker) {.            property = value;.            propertychanged();.        }.    }.}...and then this:..myclass.propertychanged += () =&gt;.{.    dosomethingwithnewvalue(myclass.property);.};...for obvious reasons, this causes a deadlock..what is the right way to handle this situation?..i can put propertychanged() after lock{}.or remove lock from get{}, or pass new value to the handler,.but it all looks somehow wrong."
