"base class used with types, possible to assign generically? assuming the following code:.. public class shared. {.     public string string1 { get; set; }. }.. public class implementedone : shared{}.. public class implementedtwo : shared{}.. public t setbaseproperties&lt;t&gt;(shared shared). {     .    // go through and assign, return type implementedone or implementedtwo. }...i have two objects inheriting from shared, implementedone and implementedtwo. each of these uses the property string1, however it can vary between the object instances. since both of them inherit the base class, can i have a generic method that assigns these common properties?"
