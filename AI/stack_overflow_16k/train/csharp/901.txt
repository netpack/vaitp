"blank use multithreading or run as separate application? i have a windows application that reads from a database and populates multiple listview containers depending on what items the user selects.  some of the data in a particular listview is right-clickable with a menuitem option to ‘write data to excel’.  this may take around 10 minutes to complete.  ..i have the excel interop portion written in stand-alone code or can i incorporate it into the application project.  the excel interop app takes only 1 parameter to do its thing...my question is… should i incorporate it into the windows app and use multithreading or run it as a standalone app (which seems more efficient), which is called from the windows app?  and what is a good way of doing that where the windows app starts the process and then can forget about it."
