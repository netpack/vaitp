"blank multiple sql select statements single method i have a task to develop a console application that is a recon of values from a few tables in the db. i have all the queries that i need for each value that is required and understand the logic on how the values will interact. the challenge i have is the best method to retrieve and store these values. ..i have researched and successfully been able to create the static method to retrieve a single value from a single sql query but i'm curious about the best method:...create multiple methods to retrieve each value (upwards of 15 different select statements) summarised below (not complete code) ..static double total1(int arg).    {.        using (sqlconnection connection = new sqlconnection(connectionstring)).        {.            connection.open();.            sqlcommand command1 = new sqlcommand(commandtext1, connection));.            return(response);.        }.}.static double total2(int arg).    {.        using (sqlconnection connection = new sqlconnection(connectionstring)).        {.              connection.open();.            sqlcommand command2 = new sqlcommand(commandtext2, connection));.            return(response);.    }.}..try to combine all select statements in a single method (i've been unsuccessful here) summarised below (not complete code)..using (sqlconnection connection = new sqlconnection(connectionstring)).{.    connection.open();.    using (sqlcommand command1 = new sqlcommand(commandtext1, connection)).    {.    }.    using (sqlcommand command2 = new sqlcommand(commandtext2, connection)).    {.    }.    // etc.}..create stored procedures in sql and execute them and pass the parameters via the blank console app ...i think method 1 is going to be taxing on the server as it would require the connection to open and close multiple times (although i don't know if that's as big a issue as i think it is). method 2 seems more reasonable although i've followed the concepts here and i get stuck when trying to get the output of the commands (i'm using return). method 3 seems smarter to me although i'd still be in a position where i need to choose between methods 1 &amp; 2 to execute the sp's...i would really appreciate advice and guidance here, i'm new to blank so this is a steep learning curve when tutorials don't cover the sort of thing (or at least i can't define my problem properly)"
