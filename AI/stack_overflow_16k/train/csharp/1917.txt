"why does this performance counter always return zero? i have this code:..using (performancecounter pfc = new performancecounter(""processor"", ""% processor time"", ""_total""))    .    return pfc.nextvalue();...this always returns 0, even when the total cpu usage is not zero, and this corresponding counter when viewed in performance monitor is also not 0...why?  what do i need to do to simply return total cpu usage?..this is a windows 8.1 virtual machine."
