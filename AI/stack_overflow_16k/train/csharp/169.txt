"if you throw/generate an exception from an asynchronous callback where does/can/should it be caught? say we're using socket.beginreceive and passing in a callback method:..    var state = new stateobject() { worksocket = socket };.    var ret = socket.beginreceive(state.buffer, 0, stateobject.buffersize, socketflags.none, new asynccallback(beginreceivecallback), state);........    private void beginreceivecallback(iasyncresult ar).    {.        stateobject state = (stateobject) ar.asyncstate;.        int bytes = state.worksocket.endreceive(ar); //worksocket is the socket receiving.        ....    }...if an exception is encountered in the callback and not handled there -  where will it go? how/can i catch it?"
