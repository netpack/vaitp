"maildefinition outside of asp.net application i'm looking to write a blank console app that will, in the process of running send out emails. i have the emails going out simply by doing something like:..     mailmessage message = new mailmessage(""foo@foo.com"", ""bar@bar.com"", ""test message"", ""test message content"");.     message.isbodyhtml = true;.     message.body = ""&lt;a href=""http://www.daringfireball.net""&gt;daringfireball.net&lt;/a&gt;"";.     smtpclient client = new smtpclient(""localhost""); // your host here..     try.     {.        client.send(message);.     }.     catch (exception e).     {.        console.writeline(""there was an error trying to send the message: "" + e.tostring());.     }...i was trying to find a way to do this with maildefinition because these emails might be longer, but in the process of doing that i ran into a little problem. the createmailmessage method requires a system.web.ui.control which i don't have because i'm not an asp.net application...has anyone run into this problem? or found a better way of doing this?..thanks"
