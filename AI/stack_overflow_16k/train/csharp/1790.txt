two namespaces with the same object name i have two namespaces:..system.numerics and unityengine..both have the type vector3...so now when ever i want to use it i have to declare which namespace before it. like this:..protected struct cvn.{.    public complex h;.    public unityengine.vector2 d;.    public unityengine.vector3 n;.}...is there any way to define that i only want vector3 from one namespace so i don't have to always type namespacehere.vector3 every single time ?..or am i stuck with the tedious nature of stating the namespace every time. especially since i only need the complex type from numerics its quite annoying.
