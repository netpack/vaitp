"read log files in reverse order and instead of complete file just read few lines may be 10 i have this method to read a log file  .. public static string getfiledata().    {..        filestream logfilestream = new filestream(configurationmanager.appsettings[""logfilelocation""].tostring(), filemode.open, fileaccess.read, fileshare.readwrite);.        streamreader logfilereader = new streamreader(logfilestream);.        string line = """";.        while (!logfilereader.endofstream).        {.            line += logfilereader.readline()+""n"";..        }..        // clean up.        logfilereader.close();.        logfilestream.close();.        return line;.    }...but now instead of showing complete log file i just want to show user last 10-20 lines as log file becomes very much heavy so its taking too much time to read complete log file."
