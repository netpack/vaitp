"how to change value in a dictionary<int, float>()? i think it's more understandable to show my code here...dictionary&lt;int, float&gt; list = new dictionary&lt;int, float&gt;();.list.add(0, 0f);..float fvalue = 0f;.list.trygetvalue(0, out fvalue);.fvalue = 10f;...this code is incorrect because float data type is not a class. it's a structure...i want to change the value, ""float"". ..anyone ideas?"
