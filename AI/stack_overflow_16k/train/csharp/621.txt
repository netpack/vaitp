"how do i use num pad short cut keys in a blank windows form? so i want to use ctrl plus a number on the num pad for a shortcut to a menu item (or button). but it seems that i am not able to do this with system.windows.forms.shortcut..for example:..this.menuitem3.shortcut = system.windows.forms.shortcut.alt7;..will work for the non-num pad number 7, but not for the num pad 7. i want to specify so that it works on the num pad (i don't care if it works for both)."
