"using ""reference3 interface"" to add desired references to a project i found this:.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vslangproj80.reference3%28vs.80%29.aspx..what i have in mind is that many of the references that we add to our project are on a network drive and there are ton of them. adding references to the project by right clicking on the references in the porject and choosing add reference is a pain...so i was wondering if i can take advantage of something like what i posted the link to it and have a small program,add-in,macro, etc! that we can give it a list of the references that i want and it will add them to the project."
