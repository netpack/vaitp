"what are the different componenets needed to produce and sell an application in blank? i need some help with my knowledge of .net !..ive always created applications using blank(for fun), i also have knowledge in c, however i have some unanswered question and ive been searching for days!...  .    once i create my form and my application is running fine, do i need to add a class of any sort to programename.cs file? and why (i breifly know why but i need to understand exactly why, and when is it a must) ? .    .    when im finished with the application design and my previous question is answered; what do i need to do to sell the application? do i just burn a cd with the .exe in it?? :s.  ...i guess my question would be, what are the different componenets needed to produce and sell an application? is it really as simple as just creating a windows application form that works??..cheers"
