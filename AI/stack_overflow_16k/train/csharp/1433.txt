"how to roll back to original value ipropertychanged? blank i have a datagrid in my xamarin form app and it got a editable column. the values in the column are from mysql database and user can change the value and store to db. i used ipropertychanged interface to allow user make the changes to the value. there is one condition when editing the value. the new value must be equal or bigger than the original value. my problem is whenever i enter a value bigger than the original, i cannot edit the value again to previous value. for example, the original value is 10. the new value i enter is 30. if i want to change the value again and this time i set it to 20, it is not allowing me because now the original value is 30 not 10 and 20 is less than 30. how can i retain the original value and compare with it?..public int actualreading.    {.        get.        {.            return _actualreading;.        }..        set.        {..            if (value &gt;= _actualreading).            {.            _actualreading = value;.            raisepropertychanged(""actualreading"");..            }.            else.            {.                userdialogs.instance.alert(""meter readings should not be smaller than previous value."",""error"",""ok"");.            }..        }.    }..private void raisepropertychanged(string name).    {.        if (propertychanged != null)..            this.propertychanged(this, new propertychangedeventargs(name));.    }"
