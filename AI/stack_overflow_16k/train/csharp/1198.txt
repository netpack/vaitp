why do you use private variables with blank getter/setters? i see this all the time:..    private int _myint;..    public int myint.    {.        get.        {.            return _myint;.        }.        set.        {.            _myint = value;.        }.    }...to me this seems identical to:..    public int myint{ get; set; }...so why does everyone do the former... why the private var at all?!
