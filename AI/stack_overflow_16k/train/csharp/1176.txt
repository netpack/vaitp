"how would i program my code to start over if a certain condition is met? for clarification i'm using microsoft visual studio and trying to turn the cmd format into a cute little interactive terminal. i'm a bare basics beginner and i'm aware this may be an ambitious project for someone of my skill. the only thing i'm confused about at the moment is how to tell the program that i want it to start itself over within the constraints of an else if statement...static void main(string[] args).        {.            console.writeline(""what's your name?"");.            string name = console.readline();.            console.writeline(""hello, "" + name);.            console.writeline(""what's your age?"");.            string age = console.readline();.            console.writeline(""your name is "" + name + "" and you are "" + age + "" years old, correct?"");.            string val = console.readline();.            if (val == ""yes"").            {.                console.writeline(""data confirmed, thank you for your cooperation!"");.            }.            else if (val == ""no"").            {       //i would like to restart the code if this condition is met.                console.writeline(""incorrect data provided, please try again"");.            }.            else.            {       //the issue with this line is that i want it to just ask if the data is correct again.                console.writeline(""that is not a valid response, try answering with a yes or no"");.            }"
