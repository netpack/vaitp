"wondering how to complete a function that will have the console write out a random string from an array of 20 answers? i'm very new to programming and still lack a lot of information, but would like to dive into it and learn from experience/constructive criticism...my current problem is getting the console to print a random string from a string array. i have some code written out already, but not sure how to initialize it or if it is even the right approach...below is the string array and a few other lines of code i thought might work to get me where i need to be, but i know i'm missing a good bit...public static void main().        {.            string[] randout = new string[20];.            randout[0] = ""it is certain."";.            randout[1] = ""it is decidedly so."";.            randout[2] = ""without a doubt."";.            randout[3] = ""yes- definitely."";.            randout[4] = ""you may rely on it."";.            randout[5] = ""as i see it, yes."";.            randout[6] = ""most likely."";.            randout[7] = ""outlook good."";.            randout[8] = ""yes"";.            randout[9] = ""signs point to yes."";.            randout[10] = ""reply hazy, try again."";.            randout[11] = ""ask again later."";.            randout[12] = ""better not tell you now."";.            randout[13] = ""cannot predict now."";.            randout[14] = ""concentrate and ask again."";.            randout[15] = ""don't count on it."";.            randout[16] = ""my reply is no."";.            randout[17] = ""my sources say no."";.            randout[18] = ""outlook not so good."";.            randout[19] = ""very doubtful."";.            random rnd = new random();.            console.writeline(randout[rnd.next(0,19)]);.        }...what i hope was that this would allow the console to print out a random string from the list, but after having it write the introductory string, nothing occurs. no errors are found with this code."
