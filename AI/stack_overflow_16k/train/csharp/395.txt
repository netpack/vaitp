"call function1 with function2 arguments i'm new to blank, with basic knowledge from other languages. and i came up with this problem:..public void startupmessage(string apptitle, string (((color)))).{                                               v--------v.    console.foregroundcolor = consolecolor.(((color)));.}...what i think is some of the problem is that the second parameter has to be something else than string. but i'm not sure."
