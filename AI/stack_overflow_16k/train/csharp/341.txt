"blank replace character every other word recently i've been given an assignment to swap out let's say x for y every other word, all the documentation i've found seems to contradict this possibility. i don't want a ""direct answer"" i'd like to exercise and learn it on my own, however if possible could someone give me a simplified example...such as replace all a's with z's every other word. ..the way my program is structured is it will ask for user input use .split, and store each word into a separate ""index"" in an array...regards, and thank you mrj"
