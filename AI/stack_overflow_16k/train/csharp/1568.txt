"compiler exception from/within a method background:.we have a legacy library in which a specific method returns an unmanaged resource (file handle). the consumers of this library work with that file handle and dispose once they are done with it. the library currently externalize the dispose since only consumer can dictate when it is safe to dispose...it so happen in some scenario where the consumer leave the file handler as is even after the purpose and this causes memory leak. to avoid this, we are in process of standardizing consumer call where it deterministically dispose the file handle...question: is it possible to throw a compiler exception from/within a method if it is not adhere to any required standard. eg: we wanted to ensure that the consumer is disposing the file handle within their implementation and if not throw a compiler generated exception..we are open to any approach including custom attributes, custom fxcope rule etc."
