"'else if' cant use variable from tryparse double x;.double y;.string strx = textboxx.text;.string stry = textboxy.text;..if (!double.tryparse(strx, out double a)).    {messagebox.show(""incorrect input"");}..else if (!double.tryparse(stry, out double b)).    {messagebox.show(""incorrect input"");}..x = a;.y = b; &lt;---...the problem is that x and receive value of a, but y cant do the same for b..i understand its because its within 'else' and might not get executed, but if i remove the else, then if both textboxes are empty or not numbers i'll get two error popups.....any help resolving the issue?"
