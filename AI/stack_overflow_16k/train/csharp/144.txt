"blank input text in a popup or similar box i need my user to enter the date of the transaction during the process of parameterizing the sql insert query. i thought of a popup window with a textbox, returning the date, as string maybe, but i faced many issues and i guess there is an easier way. also i have to call this code many times, because each transaction have different parameters, but the date is always there. there is an input box i saw, but couln't really understand how it works..thank you for your help. it's in blank."
