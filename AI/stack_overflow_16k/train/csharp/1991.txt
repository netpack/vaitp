"i am new to delegates and wonder how to break down the following code i have the following code and am wondering how to break it down?  it works great but was written by a guru and is over my head.  thank you in advance for any help...the code basically writes device information sent and received to the gui.  it seems like it has events created based on the device and also invokes gui stuff.  ...why would you need to invoke? .i guess i'm wondering if this is overly complicated or appropriate?  what may be a better way to accomplish the same task?  .i'm also wondering what the ""delegate { };"" does?....  public event eventhandler communicationperformed = delegate { };...    serialport _port;.    readonly int _delay = 100;...    private string readandupdatestatus().    {.        string read = _port.readexisting();.        communicationperformed?.invoke(this, new loaderreadwriteeventargs(read, loadercommunicationdirection.read));.        return read;.    }..    private void writeandupdatestatus(string data).    {.        if (!data.startswith(""//"")) //ignore ""comment"" lines but show them on the gui to read.            _port.write(data);.        communicationperformed?.invoke(this, new loaderreadwriteeventargs(data, loadercommunicationdirection.write));.    }....public class loaderreadwriteeventargs : eventargs.{.    public loadercommunicationdirection direction { get; }..    public string value { get; }..    public loaderreadwriteeventargs(string value, loadercommunicationdirection direction).    {.        value = value;.        direction = direction;.    }.}..public enum loadercommunicationdirection.{.    read,.    write.}"
