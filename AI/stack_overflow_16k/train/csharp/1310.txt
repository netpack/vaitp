"using a while loop in a switch statment i am new to blank and coding in general so please forgive me. i want to use a while loop in the default of my switch statement but i have no clue how to setup the bool for the while. my goal is to have the menu loop until either 1 or 2 is pressed...switch (userchoice1).{.    case ""1"":.        msg = ""nnyou have chosen the house salad with ranch dressing. npress enter to continue."";.        saladchoice = ""house salad with ranch dressing"";.        break;..    case ""2"":.        msg = ""nnyou have chosen the caesar salad. npress enter to continue. "";.        saladchoice = ""caesar salad"";.        break;..    default:.        msg = ""nnyou have chosen an invalid option. you should have selected  n1 for the house salad nor n2 for the caesar salad. "";..        console.beep();.        while (true) // i don't know if the switch should be in the while loop or here.        {.        }.        break;.}"
