"remove redundant characters from string after importing a file i'm working on application where my goal is to import a data from .txt file and store it in database. ..one row in that file looks like this: .txt file for import..lets take a look at ""papua new guinea"" which i marked with red square in the previous image...so after importing this file using iformfile i get something like this: list of items in code..my plan is to store this values to database, but i am having redudant characters as can be seen in previous picture """"papua new guinea""""...how can i remove those redudant characters? having in mind that not every item will have those redudant ("") characters (2nd image you can see some integer values)"
