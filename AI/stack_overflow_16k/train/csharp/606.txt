parsing data from a file on the server i have an application on a server and i want it to send a file that can be parsed for the data i am looking for with as little human error as possible. ..i am not sure what tags to attach to this it is being coded in blank though...i was thinking an excel spreadsheet but it can be changed to easily from what i'm told...what is a vaible way to recieve data to be parsed that can have any format?.or.what is a way to enter data to get to the network without setting up a program?..edit:.the server is on a diffrent network than the user wich they cannot directly access.
