"using an anonymous type in a try catch blank i have struggled with this for years and normally just code my way around it, but it is time to solve it...i am declaring a var that returns a new anon type and want to put it in a try/catch..however, doing that means it is out of scope and cannot be seen by later code obviously..normally i just declare it first, then wrap the code in the try/catch then reassign inside of it like:..int result = 0;..try.{.    result = 77; //real code goes here.}.catch (exception).{.    throw;.}...but here is my real code that i cannot figure out how to do something like that:...    try.    {.        var dt_stop = (from s in cdb.distributionstopinformations.                       join r in cdb.distributionrouteheaders on s.routecode equals r.routecode.                       where r.routedate == s.routedate &amp;&amp;.                       r.branchid == s.branchid &amp;&amp;.                       (r.companyno == companyno &amp;&amp; s.companyno == companyno).                       &amp;&amp; s.uniqueidno == uniqueid..                       select new.                       {.                           s,.                           r.                       }).single();.    }.    catch (exception).    { //no this will not be blank.        throw;.    }...update:.i do use dt_stop extensively after this, i am wanting to catch if there is a problem with it is assigned data...i created the following class:.. public class stopdata.{.    public distributionstopinformation s { get; set; }..    public distributionrouteheader r { get; set; }.}...then i attempt to use is like:.. stopdata dt_stop = null;..        try.        {.            dt_stop = (from s in cdb.distributionstopinformations.                       join r in cdb.distributionrouteheaders on s.routecode equals r.routecode.                       where r.routedate == s.routedate &amp;&amp;.                       r.branchid == s.branchid &amp;&amp;.                       (r.companyno == companyno &amp;&amp; s.companyno == companyno).                       &amp;&amp; s.uniqueidno == uniqueid..                       select new stopdata.                       {.                           s,.                           r.                       }).single();..        }.        catch (exception).        {.            //yes....there will be code here.            throw;.        }...i am getting.    cannot initialize type 'stopdata' with a collection initializer because it does not implement 'system.collections.ienumerable'"
