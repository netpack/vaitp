"how to make a blank library i am relatively new to programming and i am trying to create a library so that i can use my commonly used methods in different projects without having to find the last time i used it and copy paste. .i tried using  the process outlined at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/library-with-visual-studio but the method which worked in  my console app produced an error. the code is as follows:..using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;.using system.threading.tasks;..namespace utlitylibraries.{.    public static class numberlibrary.    {.        public static int[] initializenumarray().        {.            console.writeline(""please enter a series of numbers seperated by spaces"");.            string[] numbers = console.readline().split(' ');.            int[] userarray = array.convertall(numbers, int.parse);.            return userarray;.        }.    }.}...when i entered this code in the library it produced the following error: ..error  cs0117  'array' does not contain a definition for 'convertall'  ..i would greatly appreciate it if someone would be generous enough to take the time to show me where i went wrong and/or outline the process involved in creating a blank library. ..if it makes any difference i'm using visual studio 2017."
