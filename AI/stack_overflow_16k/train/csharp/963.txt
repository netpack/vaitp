"is t only considered 1 character? i was trying to do some basic logic with a do while and substring like below..bool foundfirsttaskname = false;.int startcounter = 0;.do.{.    var checkeverytwo = name.substring(startcounter, 1);.    if (checkeverytwo == ""t"").        startcounter += 1;        .    else.        foundfirsttaskname = true;..} while (!foundfirsttaskname);...i run a little code like this when a user does a paste action so i grab the contents of the clipboard and set them to 'name'. now for this application, i am checking for ""t"" since they can be pasting things from excel for instance...lets say, our pasted input for this example is - tttttest1. (this would happen by adding contents to cell e1 and copying a-e1 and pasting it into this app.)..now i my little do while is just searching for the first instance where there is no t, and it hits the bool flag...now for my actual question, when i run this app and i look at my checkeverytwo variable, if it actually sub string the t, it displays that in the var variable, that is good...so now my variable has displayed t, t, t, t, but now when it gets to the remainder of the string, it will only display 't'...why is that? i know i am using a start counter of 0, and increment by 1 which is why i get the 't', but why am i still getting back ""t"" every time then if i am increment by 1...is ""t"" considered only 1 character?.i also checked this post out, which doesn't seem to be related to my specific question..how many spaces are considered in t..ps. sorry for long post, wanted to make sure people understood my question fully."
