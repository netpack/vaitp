"adding spaces between character in a string blank well, i've got a propositional logic sentence like this : ..~(((-p|-q)-&gt;(p-&gt;q))&amp;((p-&gt;q)-&gt;(-p|q)))  ...and what i'd like to do, it's to add spaces between each character; and get something like this: ..~ ( ( ( -p | -q ) -&gt; ( p -&gt; q ) ) &amp; ( ( p -&gt; q ) -&gt; ( -p | q ) ) )  ...moreover; i wouldn't like to add spaces only in those joined character -&gt; and -p because represent an operand and a negative statements..i had found a regular expression which added spaces, but it did it with all the characters, even with those which shouldn't have. .this is the expression i had found:..(?&lt;=.)(?!$) ...so; any help for doing it; doesn't matter whether is either a method or the same regular expression but modified."
