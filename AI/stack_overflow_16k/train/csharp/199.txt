"a private class that can be passed anywhere as a parameter - is such a thing possible? i want to define a class, classa, that can be passed as a parameter to any method or class in a project (global scope). however, i want to enforce a constraint which will insure that classa can only be instantiated within the scope of a single classb. in other words, i want the class to have private scope with respect to classa while still being able to pass that object as a parameter to methods and classes distributed throughout the project. ..is this possible?"
