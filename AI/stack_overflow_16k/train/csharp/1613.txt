"why is array initialization in a static context? let's consider this class:..class abclass.{.    object a;.    object b;..    object[] ab = new[] {a, b};.}...this does not compile :..a field initializer cannot reference the non-static field, method, or property 'testconsole.abclass.a'.a field initializer cannot reference the non-static field, method, or property 'testconsole.abclass.b'...however, r# suggest this to fix successfully the compilation:..class abclass.{.    object a;.    object b;..    object[] ab;..    public abclass().    {.        ab = new[] {a, b};.    }.}...why does the array initialization seem to happen in a static context?..follow-up : in blank 6 there is the auto-properties with initializers feature. how will it relate to my issue?"
