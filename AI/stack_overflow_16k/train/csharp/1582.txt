importing a cell array from matlab to visual studio (blank) i am using visual studio(blank)  to access a simulink model (matlab). i have to read a text file which has a list of strings and numbers of varyinmg length e.g.hello.10929999.world.i have been able to read the file and these variables are available in cell array. now i have three options 1.extract the contents of the file into different variables and get each variable into blank one by one. 2. import that cell array into a string array in blank and then access each element of the string array in blank and 3.convert the cell array to character array(string) and import it to blank ..i have succeeded in 1. .3. seems cumbersome because extracting words from a string will require a loop etc..2. is the most effective of the options but the problem is that when i use the getworkspacedata option i dont know how to decode object into a string array. it is importatnt to note that it is not an object array but only an object..and if i use the getvariable command i dont knw how to extract the data. getchararray seems to be working only for a single string. plz help
