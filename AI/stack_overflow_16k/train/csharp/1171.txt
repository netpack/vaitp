"text in the center of the box centering is there a way i can make my text box's text into the center of the text box when its multi line? ..my example is windows 8 login username text box if you haven't seen it google it.i have not provided any example in code because i'm simply new to blank, i have researched it and it said something about grid? but i didn't know where to add it and i also thought it was for vb.net coding language..they all said things like..&lt;textbox width=""200"".     text=""hello world !"".     textalignment=""center""/&gt;...but i might sound dumb but i have never seen this in blank, am i looking at a different language? my app is below!!"
