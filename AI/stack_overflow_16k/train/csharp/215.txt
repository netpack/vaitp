"delegate instantiate and invoke syntax going back to basics - a little confused on the syntax sugar for delegates. here is my scenario:..i have a delegate which takes zero paramaters and returns void. essentially an action delegate with zero parameters. code snippet below (purposefully using basic delegate syntax versus action delegate usage) ..class program.{.    public delegate void del(); // declare.    static void main(string[] args).    {.        del d = methodcalled;  //instantiate.        d();   //invoke..        console.readline();.    }..    public static void methodcalled().    {.        console.writeline(""hello"");.    }.}...question: how can i combine instantiate and invocation calls in one sentence (for delegates with no return) similar to below (use-case where i have a return value coming from a delegate: ..//instantiate &amp; invoke delegate.string handler = methodcalled(""hello"");...please note - this question is not how to write a action delegate equivalent using anonymous method or lamda expressions. that i know. even in there i still have to do invocation of the delegate d(). .my question is more related to how do i combine 2 statements (irrespective of the syntax used - basic delegate, action delegate)"
