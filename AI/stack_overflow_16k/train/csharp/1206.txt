"how to model ""stage"" with both int and timespan - custom enum? i have a class named ""creature"" which is in one of several stages.  there are only seven stages, but each stage has a different timespan that will be used throughout the application.  i'd like to do something like the following: ..enum stage.    {.    one,.    two,.    three,.    four,.    five.    };...but then also somehow attach a timespan to each of those, so that..stage.one.time ...returns something like ""one hour"".  how can this be achieved?"
