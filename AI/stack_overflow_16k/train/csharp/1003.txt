"blank - get second to last item in a list i have some code written in blank. in this code, i have a list&lt;keyvaluepair&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; items. i am trying to get the second-to-last item in the list. i'm having problems doing it though...originally, my collection was just a dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;. at that point, i was using:..var nexttolast = items.reverse().skip(1).firstordefault();...that worked. however, since items is now a list&lt;keyvaluepair&lt;int, string&gt;&gt;, the reverse method returns a void. so, i can't do the skip...anyone know of an elegant way for me to get the second-to-last item from a list&lt;keyvaluepair&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; in blank? ..i know i can use a loop. i just figured there had to be a better way."
