"insert to arraylist in specific position i am trying to insert a person's name into a specific position within my arraylist, i get an error when i run this:..public void insertintoarraylist(string actname, int posnum).{.    snip.}...the user would enter the name into the name textbox then the position(index) at which to insert the string...any suggestions on an easier way to code this or a way i can change it?..the error i get is - that the index is out of range. i assume the conversion might be messed up?"
