"get names of the params passed to a blank method void mymethod(string something, params object[] parameters).    {.      foreach (object parameter in parameters).      {.        // get the name of each passed parameter.      }.    }...for example, if i call the method in the following way, i want to get the names ""myfirstparam"" and ""anotherparam""...string myfirstparam = ""some kind of text"";.string anotherparam = 42;.mymethod(""test"", myfirstparam, anotherparam);...perhaps reflection is the answer? perhaps it's just not possible? i am aware of the existance of this question, but that solution won't work here...(please do not respond with ""this is not a good idea"". that is not my question.)"
