saving file in folder and path in database i want to save image into a folder and the path of the folder to the database. ..i have done this with file.copy(filepath) command but it is giving me error when a file with the same name already exists there. ..second thing in this command is that i have to provide a filename in it from which it is copying the file. if i am modifying a record and not the image then it is giving error that file source cannot be empty. ..i have also tried picture1.image.save(filename) but i have not found any command to overwrite the existing file. ..please help me by providing a simplest way to do all this.
