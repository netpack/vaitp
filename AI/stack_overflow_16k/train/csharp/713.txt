"trying to make quit sequence that only proceeds when correct input is given i'm having trouble creating a loop that will request user input and if the input is not ""y"" or ""n"" to re-prompt the user to input over and over until they give the correct input...while (quitorcontinue != ""y""|""n"")//cant use ""y""/""n"" in the same line, how do i phrase this line?.console.write(""nwould you like to process another set of bowling scores?"");.console.writeline(""npress 'y' to process another set or 'n' to exit the program"");..console.clear();// this needs to happen if the input to run again is ""y"""
