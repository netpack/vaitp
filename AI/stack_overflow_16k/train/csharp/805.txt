"blank converting from double to int loses precision i'm trying to convert from a price to the smallest currency unit. eg. when receiving the value 9.45 it should produce the result 945..the conversion code should take a double and convert it to an int while maintaining a two decimal precision...this blank console code gives me a strange rounding error... double val = 9.45d;. var result = (int)(val * 100);. system.console.writeline(""result is "" + result); // 944...the result of the code snippet is 944 which baffles me. what's wrong?"
