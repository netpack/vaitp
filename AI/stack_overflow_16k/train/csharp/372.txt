"blank how to make overlapping areas drawn with graphics darker i am working on a small project that draws many filled circles on a form with the graphics class and solidbrushes. is there a way to make areas darker when graphics are overlapping? i would like to have it so as more circles overlap, the overlapped areas get gradually darker in whatever color the circles are drawn in...i have looked over the graphics class documentation but i can't seem to find anything talking about this in it...but i might have missed something...any help is greatly appreciated! thank you!"
