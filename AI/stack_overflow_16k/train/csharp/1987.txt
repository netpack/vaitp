"blank idle game; adding money issue i am currently working on a blank only (no unity) idle game (a.k.a clicker game) where the user collects money by clicking a button and leveling up a gold mine, here is the code;..namespace business_tycoon.{.public partial class form1 : form.{       .    public decimal level;.    public decimal money;.    public decimal revenue;.    public decimal multiplier;.    public decimal price;.    public form1().    {.        initializecomponent();.        start();.    }.    void start().    {.        money = 10;          .    }..    void update().    {.        money = money + revenue;.    }...    void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        price = ((price/100) * 150m);.        level = (level + 1);.        multiplier = 1.10m;                .        money = (money - price);.        revenue = (level * multiplier);             .        button1.text = ""price: "" + price;                  .        textbox1.text = ""item bought"";.        label4.text = ""money: "" + convert.tostring(money);.        label1.text = ""level: "" + convert.tostring(level);.        label3.text = ""revenue: "" + convert.tostring(revenue);.    }...    private void button2_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        update();.    }.}...}...button1 is the level button, the player clicks this, subtracting.money, and it levels up the gold mine one level at a time..button2 is the collect button, the player clicks this which adds the.revenue created from the gold mine....however, to collect from button2 the player must first click button1 to level it up and i do not know how to solve this. the player should just be able to click on the collect button and add whatever the revenue is of the gold mine...please coud someone help, thank you - maximus"
