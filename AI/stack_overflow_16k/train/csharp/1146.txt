"add a second command that calls another method? i'm remaking a text-based adventure game. during the character creation, i'd like for the user, at any time, to type 'skillset' and list all the traits that a specific race has. i've tried for a couple hours and can't seem to figure it out...this is my character creation class...public string usercommand_seachskill;..    skillset searchskill = new skillset();..    public void create_character().    {..        // choose gender //.        do.        {.            validate = 0;.            console.clear();.            console.write(""are you male or female? (f/m): "");.            sex = console.readline().toupper();...            if (sex == ""m"" || sex == ""f"").            {.                validate = 1;  .            }.            else if (sex != ""m"" || sex != ""f"").            {.                console.writeline(""you must enter 'm' or 'f'"");.            }...        } while (validate == 0);...and this is my skill set class. everything in the if/else statements are methods to print the traits of a race to the console. let me know if there is anything else i can add to better ask my question. thank you in advance! :)..classattributes classes = new classattributes();.character character = new character();.skillset = console.readline().toupper();.        do.        {.            validate = 0;.            if (skillset == ""human"").            {.                classes.skillsethuman();.            }.            else if (skillset == ""orc"").            {.                classes.skillsetorc();.            }.            else if (skillset == ""elf"").            {.                classes.skillsetelf();.            }.            else if (skillset == ""exit"").            {.                validate = 1;.                character.create_character();.            }..        } while (validate == 0);"
