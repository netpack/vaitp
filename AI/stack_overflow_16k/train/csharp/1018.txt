"is it possible to reuse a connection when accessing multiple tables in blank? i am new to blank. i have a program which reads multiple tables in single database. suppose if i am reading table a so before reading this i have to connect to database in blank. after this i have to fetch some information from table b. do i have to give the server info, userid and password again to connect to database?"
