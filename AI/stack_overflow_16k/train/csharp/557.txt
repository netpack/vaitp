"set culture info for export only i am interested in exporting some data (mostly numbers) into an excel and i need it to be in the us format (i.e. 1,234,567.89) no matter what is the current culture of the user. i don't want to change the culture for the whole application. i just need to make sure the numbers will be in the right format. i've tried setting the culture for the current thread, but it seems it changes the culture for the whole application. any help will be appreciated. ..edit my data will be in datatable. do i need to go through every value and convert it?"
