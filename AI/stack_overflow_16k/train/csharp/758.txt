"find a row with timestamp closest to the given time in datatable i have a datatable with a column named timestamp and other columns. i'm trying to find those rows where the timestamps are nearest to the given times. for example, there are some rows with different timestamps. how can i find the rows which are closest to 12/02/2015 15:00:00, 12/02/2015 15:15:00, etc. in the following samples, rows with timestamp 12/02/2015 14:59:48.089 and 12/02/2015 15:16:01.376 are the most closed rows for the given time 12/02/2015 15:00:00 and 12/02/2015 15:15:00 respectively.........12/02/2015 14:57:59.768..12/02/2015 14:59:48.089..12/02/2015 15:00:59.453..12/02/2015 15:02:12.145..12/02/2015 15:10:35.789..12/02/2015 15:16:01.376...........i tried to use..datarow[] drrows = dtmyrecords.select(""min(timestamp-#12/02/2015 15:00:00#)""); ...or..object obj = dtstationrecords.compute(""min(timestamp-'12/02/2015 15:15:00')"", null);...to find it. but they don't work. could you give solutions?"
