"blank exceedingly long execution time on list<t>.find() i'm using blank to build a game that involves a grid-based map system. i'm storing the grid system in a list object where t is a type that contains position and other data. upon calling a function that finds a tile's neighbors, i've run into an extreme delay in execution. i've narrowed the delay down to a call to the find() method of my list. the method looks like this:...  list.find(tile => tile.x == x &amp;&amp; tile.y == y)...why is this causing such immense lag? is there any better alternative to storing my tiles in a list?"
