"resources to learn oop design patterns in regards to data driven applications hi i'm trying to find some good resources for using oop in the context of data driven applications.  i have a relativity firm grasp of oop i use objects, interfaces, and delegates quite often in my code.  however, i find more often then not in when i write data driven apps ( which is the bulk of my work right now ) i tend to veer to a functional approach.  this is mostly because i don't know the right way to do it i guess...i've only been programming for about a year and recently i've been putting allot of time into trying to improve my knowledge of design patterns (i'm currently reading blank 3.0 design patterns watching the john skeet videos) and really writing unit test for everything.  however, i find that allot of examples that i see tend to not deal with data driven apps.  more with like truck inheritances from car stuff lol..so i was wondering if anyone could point me in the directions of some good videos, tutorials or even books on the subject ?"
