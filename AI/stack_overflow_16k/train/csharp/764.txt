"why can't the ??-operator be applied to generic types, but a null-check can be applied? if i have a generic function that returns a t or some default value i want to use the ?? operator..t f&lt;t&gt;(t a, t b).{.    return a ?? b;.}...this fails with the message...  operator '??' cannot  be applied to operands of type 't' and 't'...i assume this is because t might not be nullable. but i would also assume that the ?? operator above should do the same as..t f&lt;t&gt;(t a, t b).{.    var a_ = a;.    return a_ != null ? a_ : b;.}...and the second code compiles without a problem...so why are those cases handled differently even though they should do the same?"
