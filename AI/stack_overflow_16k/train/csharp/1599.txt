"blank: merge uniform with figure code? i have a figure code which detects what pieces of clothing a user is wearing. here are some examples of some random figure codes...lg-285-76.hr-155-31.sh-300-92.ca-1819-63.hd-209-2.ch-3030-76..he-3149-1331.sh-3035-110.hr-170-61.fa-3276-72.ch-255-110.hd-209-2.lg-280-1331..ch-210-110.hd-209-7.hr-828-1407.he-3082-63.lg-280-1408.cp-3309-77.sh-290-92....the two-letter codes indicate the type of clothing, for example:...lg = leg.ch = chest.sh = shoes.he = head.hr = hair...what i want to do is to merge that figure code with a uniform code. lets say i have a uniform code that i wanted the figure code to be merged with, and that this uniform contained a tshirt and trousers. it would contain the lg tag for leg and the ch tag for chest...uniform string: lg-285-76.sh-300-92.ch-3030-76...what i want to do is to replace the legs, chest etc in the main figure code, and replace them with the one in the uniform string, here is what i have tried so far:..public static string returnuniform(string uniform, string figure).{.    string[] uniformparts = uniform.split('.');.    string[] figureparts = uniform.split('.');..    foreach (string uniformpart in uniformparts).    {.        string[] childuniformparts = uniformpart.split('-');..        if (figure.contains(""."" + childuniformparts[0])).        {.            // remove it from figure parts and replace it with the uniform one here.        }.    }..    return string.join("""", figureparts);.}"
