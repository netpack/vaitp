"why is the `ref` keyword not mandatory here? i clearly doesn't understand ref and the scope of a parameter good enough.  can someone tell me why this code works? how can you send dt into a function (i mean it will become a parameter and the scope would be as a local variable right?). so why is dt populated(filled) after fill() has been called? ..so my first thought was i'm only sending a reference to dt with fill(), but then i doesn't understand the ref keyword. i thought that's what we had that for.. do you only have to use ref when the parameter is value by type?..var dt = new datatable();.using (var cmd = new mysqlcommand(cmdtext, connection)).using (var adapter = new mysqldataadapter()).{.    adapter.selectcommand = cmd;.    adapter.fill(dt); // &lt;---why is ref not needed here?.}.return dt;"
