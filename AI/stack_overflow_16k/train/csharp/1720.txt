"project and develop a framework / class library me and another guys would like to develop a framework. our mission is to create something abstract and general enough to let us develop smartly a set of different web application (with the same core idea)...i'd like to know if there's a docs i can read, to better understand which should be the way to project a framework (ie: which layered solutions i'd choose and so on)..thx everyone"
