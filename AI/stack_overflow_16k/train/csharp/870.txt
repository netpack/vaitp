"what causes directory.getfiles() to append the given path to the path the program is run from? i'm using directory.getfiles() to get all the files in a path on a network location..however i'm running into an issue where it is appending the path i give it to the path that the program is running from...so,..string workingdir = ""\1.1.1.1cpathtodirectory"".string dirtosearch ""\1.1.1.1pathtosearch""...but when i run the program directory.getfiles(dirtosearch); it searches for files in ..\1.1.1.1cpathtodirectory1.1.1.1pathtosearch...i've found no cause for this in the documentation or in my searches on google and i'm not even really sure where to start debugging this."
