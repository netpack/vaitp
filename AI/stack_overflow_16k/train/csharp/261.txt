"how can i implement a global int/counter across my whole application? this may be obvious to someone else, i've wrestled with it for hours to no avail...how can i implement a global int/counter across my whole application?..it's just one int i need and it would only ever increase..the counter would be called asynchronously from a few different methods in different classes that are all contributing to the same json output from a webapi. .there are lots of small chunks of data that need a unique id attached to them. ..hope this makes sense. .thanks for any help."
