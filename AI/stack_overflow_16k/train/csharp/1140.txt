"storing values in an array and outputting the highest,lowest,average. output flaw this was a small problem the teacher gave us at school. we were asked to make a program which keeps asking the user to input test scores until he inputs -99 to stop the program. the values are stored in an array and the highest, lowest and average scores are displayed...the problem i have with my code is that whenever i run it it always gives me a value of 0 for lowest scores even though there are no zeros in the input. can anyone please point out the mistake in my code?..code:..static void main(string[] args).    {.        int[] za = new int[100];.        scores(za, 0);.    }.. public static void scores(int[] ar, int x).    {..        console.write(""please enter homework score [0 to 100] (-99 to exit): "");.        int a = convert.toint16(console.readline());.        if (a != -99).        {.            ar[x] = a;.            x++;.            scores(ar, x);.        }.        else.        {.            console.clear();.            console.writeline(""homework app"");..            int[] arr = new int[x];.            foreach (int l in arr).            {.                arr[l] = ar[l];.            }..            int lowest = arr[0];.            for (int i = 1; i &lt; arr.length; i++).            {.                if (lowest &gt; arr[i]) { lowest = arr[i]; }.            }..            int highest = arr[0];.            for (int j = 1; j &lt; arr.length; j++).            {.                if (highest &lt; arr[j]) { highest = arr[j]; }.            }..            double sum = 0;.            double nums = 0;.            for (int k = 0; k &lt; arr.length; k++).            {.                sum = sum + arr[k];.                nums++;.            }.            double average = sum / nums;..            console.writeline(""highest score: {0}"", highest);.            console.writeline(""lowest score: {0}"", lowest);.            console.writeline(""average score: {0}"", average);..            console.readline();.        }.    }"
