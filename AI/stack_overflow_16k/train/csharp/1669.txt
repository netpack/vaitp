"how to check if a datetime field is not null or empty? i am very new in blank and i have a doubt...in an application on which i am working i found something like it in the code:..if (!string.isnullorempty(u.nome))...this code simply check if the nome field of the u object is not an emptynull string...ok this is very clear for me, but what can i do to check it if a field is not a string but is datetime object?"
