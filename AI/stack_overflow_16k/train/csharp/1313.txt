"blank regex quick help i'm trying to read a text file, and then break it up by each line thats is split by a ""n"".  then regex it  and write out the regex...string contents = file.readalltext(filename);.        string[] firefox = filename.split(""rn"");.        string prefix = prefix = regex.match(firefox, @""(d)"").groups[0].value;.        file.appendalltext(workingdirform2 + ""configuration.txt"", prefix);...string[] firefox = filename.split(""rn""); doesnt exactly work.  ..what i want to do is run a regex foreach line of contents and then write out each line after the regex..so.....filename:.hero123.hero243.hero5959  ..writes out to:.13.243.5959  ..well everybody is suggesting something off the base in which i started.  the ending result will be about a 20 line regex with ints.  i've got to parse it out line by line."
