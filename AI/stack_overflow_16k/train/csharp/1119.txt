"how do i access datagridview from another form? i want to access a datagridview from another form. i just want to get a value from datagridview and show it in a textbox located in another form...as shown in the photo: .i click edit line button and form2 pops up, so when i click button1, textbox1 should have the value of row[0] cell[0] (which is ""1"") but instead i get this error:.an unhandled exception of type 'system.argumentoutofrangeexception' occurred in mscorlib.dll...additional information: index was out of range. must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection...is there anything i am missing? i made datagridview modifiers = public but still didn't work. please help thank you."
