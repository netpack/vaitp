"unorthodox approach to checking if a string is a palindrome i'm attempting to create an unorthodox approach to working out if a string is palindrome or not. i am aware of the current .reverse() method that you can use but this is the way that i am trying to do it:..the user will enter the string and then the program will check the first and last letters of the string. if they are the same, it will keep checking. if they are not (at the start or at any particular point) then the program will declare that it is not a palindrome. once the program stops checking and sees that no letters are not the same, it will declare that it is a palindrome...here is my current code below:..using system;.using system.collections.generic;..namespace tasks.{ .    class program.    {.        public static void main(string[] args).        {.            console.writeline(""enter a message and i will check if it     is a palindrome: "");.            string message1 = convert.tostring(console.readline().tolower());.            char[] message = message1.tochararray();.            int i = 0;.            int j = message.length - 1;.        if (message[i] == message[j]).        {.            do.            {.                i++;.                j--;.                if (message[i] == message[j]).                    console.write(""this is a palindrome"");.                else if (message[i] != message[j]).                    console.write(""this is not a palindrome"");.                break;.            } while (message[i] == message[j]);.        }.        else if (message[i] != message[j]).        {.            console.writeline(""this is not a palindrome"");.        }.    }.}...(sorry about the indentation)...if i was to type in 'haegah', the program would say that this is a palindrome. when it is clearly not. my question is, what is causing my program to do this and how can i fix it?"
