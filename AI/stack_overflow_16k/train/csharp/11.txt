"how to count the frequency of each number in an int list? i have a list of player numbers(int list), i also have a number of laps (int laps). i have to enter the number of the player into a text box each time the player completes a lap. if valid, the player number entered into the text box will be sent to a list. however, each player number cannot be entered more than the number of laps. ..i'm new to windows forms so i've only used lists to solve the problem, i've seen people use dictionary to solve similar issues but i'm not quite sure how to incorporate that to solve this issue...    private void textbox2_textchanged(object sender, eventargs e).    {..        bool result;.        int runnernumberinorder;..        repeat2 = (getlaps2 * rows2);.        textbox2.focus();..        //readplayernumber is the list that contains the list of the runners in the race. .        //playernumberinorder int list is a global list and it is the list that the runners number order gets sent to if valid..        result = int.tryparse(textbox2.text, out runnernumberinorder); //checks if the value entered is an integer...        if (result == false || !readrunnernumbers2.contains(runnernumberinorder)) //if the value entered is not an integer an error message will pop up and ask to enter a valid number.        {.            label3.text = ""please enter a valid player number from the list"";..        }..        else.        {.            if (runnerorder.contains(runnernumberinorder)).            {..                count++;.            }..            if (count == getlaps2).            {.                count = 0;.                label3.text = ""max laps for this runner has been entered"";...                invalid.add(runnernumberinorder); //invalid is an int list that i used to send the numbers of the runners that have completed all laps. ...                textbox2.clear();.                return;..            }..        }..        if (invalid.contains(runnernumberinorder)).        {.            messagebox.show(""max number of laps for this runner has been entered"");.            textbox2.clear();.        }..        if (result == true &amp;&amp; readrunnernumbers2.contains(runnernumberinorder) &amp;&amp; !invalid.contains(runnernumberinorder)).        {.            runnerorder.add(runnernumberinorder); //if number entered is valid, the it is added to the global variable             .            playernumbersentered++;.            label8.text = runnernumberinorder.tostring();//counts how many valid car numbers have been enterted.            textbox2.clear();.        }...    }...the code i have kinda works but it sometimes only allows one number 2 times when the number of laps is 3 and sometimes will allow more than the laps entered. i want an error message to pop up when the player's number equals to the number of laps and the number shouldn't be allowed any further. i also have to use a text_change. cheers for the help in advance."
