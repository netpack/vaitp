"letter replacement in string i have this simple code for letter substitution. what i would like to add is, that if i.e., i replace letter a with letter t, all t letters are automatically replaced with a as well. so if i have a word ""atatatat"", the following code changes the word to ""tttttttt"", but it should change it to ""tatatata"". how can i fix this?..private void button3_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.    string key= this.textbox1.text;.    string letter1 = this.textbox2.text;.    string letter2 = this.textbox3.text;..    stringbuilder newkey = new stringbuilder();.    newkey.appendline(key);.    newkey.replace(letter1, letter2);.    this.textbox4.text = novikljuc.tostring();.}...i tried with adding this line: newkey.replace(letter2, letter1); but this changes word to ""aaaaaaaa"""
