"is it really worth it? i'm working on a project that was made by another developer, and i've been assigned the job to add extra functionality, although this question isn't about one application, it's about a language...in blank, i find myself running across this probably around 50 times a day, i need to grab a value from a method and store it to a variable, or i need to store a variable, or even if i just need to hard code a variable to something...do i go with my head or my heart? my head says store it in a variable incase i need to use it more than once in the future, but then my heart says lets be lazy and just add it to the if check, instead of calling the variable, let me give you an example... ..example 1:..var name = someclass.getname();    .if (name.contains(""something"")).{.    // do something .}...example 2:..if (someclass.getname().contains(""something"")).{.    // do something .}...i guess what i am asking is, does it have any sort of advantage? or does it not really matter? ..am i using memory by storing these? especially if i'm storing hundreds across a solution in all different types of methods?..is it worth just using it inside the if directly for an advantage, or should i just have a variable just in case? can anyone explain the difference? if there is any that is...i'm talking about if i only ever use the variable once, so don't worry about the ""having to change in multiple locations"" issue, although if anyone does want to go into that aswell, i would appreciate it."
