"polling database to print out files i need a program that sends any files in my database (mssql) to my printer. i thought of using something like this:..thread.sleep(20000);...so every 20 seconds i check my database if there are any changes and if so, print the files. but i was wondering if there is a better way? .something to send interrupts to my program when the database changed?"
