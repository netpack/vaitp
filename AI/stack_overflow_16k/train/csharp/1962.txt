"simplifying code for message box were file name is built from file.writealltext i have the this code that i would like to simplify..       file.writealltext(.            path.combine(dir,.                datetime.now.tostring(""dd-mm-yyyy_hh-mm-ss"") + ""-"" + messagetype + ""-"" + messagegateway + "".csv""),.            messagebody);..        messagebox.show(strings.allactionlogviewmodel_exportmessagecontenttocsv_saved_log_file + "" "" + datetime.now.tostring(""dd-mm-yyyy_hh-mm-ss"") + ""-"" + messagetype + ""-"" + messagegateway + "" "" + ""to "" + dir);}...as you can see i have duplicated the filename syntax in messagebox.  i would like to condense this so my message box returns the file name but gets it from the file.writealltest method as opposed to rewriting the syntax."
