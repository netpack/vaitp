"access text files contained in a solution i have 3 text files in my solution (they are in the solution explorer) that i need to read in from. i don't want them copied to the output directory and they are marked as embedded resources. the path to them is projectnamespace.utility.names.namexxx.txt..i need to access them in a class, also in the names folder:..    public randomname().    {.        _prefixparts = populatefromfile(""aow.utility.names.nameprefix.txt"");.        _middleparts = populatefromfile(""aow.utility.names.namemiddle.txt"");.        _suffixparts = populatefromfile(""aow.utility.names.namesuffix.txt"");.    }...what is the correct syntax to read in from these files?..update: here is the populatefromfile method in case it matters:..private static string[] populatefromfile(string path).    {.        return file.readalllines(path);.    }...update: i'm attempting to implement the code from this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/16901400/1667020..update: well, i've gotten it to work at this point:.._prefixparts = populatefromfile(@""c:usersownerdesktopaowaowaowutilitynamesnameprefix.txt"");._middleparts = populatefromfile(@""c:usersownerdesktopaowaowaowutilitynamesnamemiddle.txt"");._suffixparts = populatefromfile(@""c:usersownerdesktopaowaowaowutilitynamesnamesuffix.txt"");...how can i make the path local to the project?"
