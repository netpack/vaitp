"what synchronism can i use? i'm working in blank and i'm searching for a mechanism to synchronize my application...i have a function to manage anomaly in my application, working on multi-thread. when an anomaly is raised, a function is called, making some treatment and asking for user to check...if a new anomaly is raised while the first is in progress i want to wait for the first and doing nothing after (function has been executed for the first)..how can i do that properly ?..my draft :..private void onanomaly(enumanomaly err).{.    if (anomalyinprogress).        //wait.        return;.    else.        anomalyinprogess = true;.        //do something.        anomalyinprogess = false;.}"
