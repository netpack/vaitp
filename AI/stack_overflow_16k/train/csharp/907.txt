"creating derived class with given base class if i have this:..public class bclass.{.    int id {get; set;}.    string name {get; set;}.}..public class dclass : bclass.{.    int extraval {get; set;}.}...and i have a list of bclass objects:..list&lt;bclass&gt; baseclasslist = getbaseclasslist();...what is the easiest way to convert the baseclasslist to a list of dclass objects with ""extralval"" set as a specified value? i would hope for a solution something like:..public class dclass : bclass.{.    public dclass(bclass b, int exval).    {.        base = b;.        extraval = exval;.    }.    int extraval {get; set;}.}..list&lt;dclass&gt; dclasslist = bclasslist.convertall(x =&gt; new dclass(x, exval));...where it essentially just plugs in the base and then sets the extra property value, but obviously that is not the right syntax. what is the correct way to do this?"
