"subsequent method calls to same method enters a new context? i have a question regarding method calls and stack pointers...basically i have a program that reads input from the user. after creating an object of a class ""input"", a method call ""prompt()"" presents a menu with choices, and each choice you make calls a new method that performs some operations. after making a choice, you can always choose to go back to the main menu, and this action calls ""prompt()"" again. ..now, my question is, will each call of ""prompt()"" point to a new place in the memory stack or will it enter the same context as when the first call was made? i.e is it possible to create a memory leak by going back to the main menu over and over?..class inout {..public string[] prompt(){.   ....   presentchoices();.   ....}..private void presentchoices(){.   ....   if(somechoice){.       manualinput();.   }.   ....}..private void manualinput(){.   ....   if(goback){.       prompt();.   }.   ....}...}..i hope the question was clear and thanks in advance for any answers on this!"
