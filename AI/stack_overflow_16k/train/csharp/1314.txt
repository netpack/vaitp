check difference in seconds between two times hi all i am currently working on a project where when a certain event happens details about the event including the time that the event occurred is added into a list array. ..once the method has finished i then pass on the list to another method that checks its values. before i go through the loop i check the current time of my pc and i need to check whether the difference between the time saved in the list array and the current time is greater than 5 seconds. ..how would i go about doing this.
