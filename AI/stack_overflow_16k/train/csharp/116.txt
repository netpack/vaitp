"open when minimized on key down i'm trying to do something like what steam has; when in the game and you click shift+tab it opens overlay with data relative to steam. as i understand, this can be done since steam is on when game is played through steam. it can also be done by assigning a key to open program through windows settings, but my question is whether or not program can listen to the keypressevent event even if it's minimized? in other wards, can i open the program even if it's minimized by just pressing the assigned key?"
