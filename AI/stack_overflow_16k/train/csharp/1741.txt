"is there a way to check a character against a list of strings without writing a long chain of or operators? the first if statement in this program checks a string against a letter i am using the logical or operator (||) to compare the first letter against the string. it's tedious and for the future i am looking for a way to this faster and make it shorter...string struser;.string strsubcheck;.console.writeline(""please type in a word:"");.struser = console.readline();.strsubcheck = struser.substring(0, 1);    ..if(strsubcheck == ""a"" || strsubcheck == ""a"" || strsubcheck == ""e"" || strsubcheck == ""e"" || strsubcheck == ""i"" || strsubcheck == ""i"" || strsubcheck == ""o"" || strsubcheck ==  ""o"" || strsubcheck == ""u"" || strsubcheck == ""u"").    {.      console.writeline(""nthe first letter is a vowel"");.    }.else console.writeline(""nthe first letter is a consonant"");"
