"blank program to get modified date from url directory i am fairly new to blank and was hoping for some assistance. i currently use visual studio 2008. what i am wanting to do is the following:..i have a server (backupserv) that runs a robocopy script nightly to backup directories from 18 other servers. these directories are then copied down to backup in directories of their own:..example:.it copies down ""dir1"", ""dir2"", and ""dir3"" from server1 into backupservbackupsserver1 into their own directories (backupservbackupsserver1dir1, backupservbackupsserver1dir2, and backupservbackupsserver1dir3)...it does this for all 18 servers nightly between 12am and 6am. the robocopy runs via schedule task. a log file is created in backupservbackupslog and is named server1-dir1.log, server1-dir2.log, etc. ..what i am wanting to accomplish in blank is the ability to have a 'report' showing the modified date of each text log file. to do this i need to browse the backupservbackupslog directory, determine the modified date, and have a report displayed (prefer html if possible). along with the modified date i will be showing more information, but that is later...again, i am fairly new to blank, so, please be gentle. i was referred here by another programmer, and was told i would get some assistance...if i have missed any detail please let me know and i will do my best to answer."
