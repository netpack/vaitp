"make a countdown from now to a date in the future[blank] hello so i'm trying to make something like a countdown from the time now to a time in the future, therefor i initialize 5 new variables:..int currentyear = datetime.now.year, currentmonth = datetime.now.month, currentday = datetime.now.day, currenthour = datetime.now.hour, currentminute = datetime.now.minute;...so now i have f.e. a date in the future like 04.11.2016 11:14(day.month.year hour.minute) so now i tried to just subtract those values but i ended up getting negative numbers and since i want a countdown looking like this: .years: 0000.months: 00.days: 00.hours: 00.minutes: 00.seconds: 00.that's not really what i want to end up with. so i wanted to ask if there is an object orientated way on how to do this, without using a ton of if statements? thanks in advance"
