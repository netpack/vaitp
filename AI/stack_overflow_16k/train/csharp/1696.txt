"shortcut &= acting like & not && public static void main().{.    var result = false;.    xpto xpto = null;.    result &amp;= xpto.some;.}..public class xpto.{.    public bool some { get; set; }.}...i'm using blank 6.0 vs2015; the code above triggers a null exception...the &amp;= operator is behaving like the &amp; operator. i would expect it to behave similar to &amp;&amp; and skip evaluation of the right side if value already false (see explanation of ""short-circuit"" behavior in the conditional-and operator (&amp;&amp;) article). ..is this behavior intended or is it a bug?"
