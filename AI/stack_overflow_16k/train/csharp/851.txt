automate login to google and download a spreadsheet my blank application reads and processes excel file. recently i moved my spreadsheets to google documents. now i need to sign in to google and access a particular link(equivalent to export) to get the exported form of the spreadsheet (xls) that my application reads...i was wondering if there is any way to automate logging to google and getting the xls file to a particular location so that i can avoid the trouble of logging in and downloading the excel file. any thoughts on this?..(i'm thinking of saving the google credentials and link for the xls file in an xml)
