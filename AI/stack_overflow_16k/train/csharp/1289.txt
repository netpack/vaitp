console like output in windows with blank.net is there a control that would allow me a console like output of text? like cout in c++ or textout in wm paint message. ..i need to output a two dimensional array and later be able to change background color of each array element. if there are any other ways i could achieve it please do leave a suggestion. however i can't use an array of labels or other controls.
