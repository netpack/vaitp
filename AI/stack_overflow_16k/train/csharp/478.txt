"is it possible to get only initialized properties in a blank class i have a class as follows..public class sampleclass{..  public string property1 {get; set;}..  public string property2 {get; set;}..  public string property3 {get; set;}..}....then i create an initialization of this class only with two properties and send it through some method. here, i get all the 3 properties but how can i differentiate whether the 3rd property is initialized or not while accessing within the method?...var classinstance = new sampleclass {.  property1 = ""one"",.  property2 = ""two"".};..this.somemethod(classinstance);..// is it possible to get that the third property is not defined in the class instance in this method?"
