"console.writeline() error cs1503 cannot convert from 'void' to 'bool' i am executing this simple program in which i am trying to see the outcome of console.writeline with function returning void given as an argument. ..using system;..class program.{.    static void printme().    {.    }..    static void main(string[] args).    {.        console.writeline(printme());.    }.}...this is giving following error:..program.cs(11,27): error cs1503: argument 1: cannot convert from 'void' to 'bool' [c:usersnafeez quraishisourcereposxx.csproj]..the build failed. fix the build errors and run again....as per the writeline documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console.writeline?view=netframework-4.8.this looks to be corresponding to following case:...  writeline(object)     .  .  writes the text representation of the specified object, followed by.  the current line terminator, to the standard output stream....question is:..in order to write text representation of the function object returning void, why is it trying to covert it in to bool(than perhaps string)?"
