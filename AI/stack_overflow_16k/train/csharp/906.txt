"function assign with multiple line i am new to programming in blank, and i know that .videodownloader.downloadprogresschanged += (sender, args) =&gt; console.writeline(args.progresspercentage); will run the console.writeline whenever the videodownloader.downloadprogresschanged is called. but i don't know how to have more than one line in that function. ..i want to be able to have something like:..videodownloader.downloadprogresschanged += (sender, args).{.    if ((args.progresspercentage % 1) == 0).    {.        console.writeline(args.progresspercentage);.    }.}...also, can someone explain to me what this is (and what it is called) and how/when this kind of thing is used?"
