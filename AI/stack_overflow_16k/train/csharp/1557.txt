"how to draw polygon including negative points ? in blank i am doing blank project. i have found a problem and unable to find answer of this problem that's why i am posting here/.i am implementing procedural floor plan generation in blank. at first i need to draw a polygon to on given points to generate grid. points can be positive or negative. points will be in floating...from the microsoft documentation i am able to draw polygon for the floating positive points, but when i change points to negative it does not draw anything on form...this method id drawing x,y coordinates 0,0 in the corner ...code example.public void drawpolygonpointf(painteventargs e).{..// create pen..pen blackpen = new pen(color.black, 3);..// create points that define polygon..pointf point1 = new pointf(50.0f,  50.0f);.pointf point2 = new pointf(100.0f,  25.0f);.pointf point3 = new pointf(200.0f,   5.0f);.pointf point4 = new pointf(250.0f,  50.0f);.pointf point5 = new pointf(300.0f, 100.0f);.pointf point6 = new pointf(350.0f, 200.0f);.pointf point7 = new pointf(250.0f, 250.0f);.pointf[] curvepoints =.         {.             point1,.             point2,.             point3,.             point4,.             point5,.             point6,.             point7.         };..// draw polygon curve to screen..e.graphics.drawpolygon(blackpen, curvepoints);...}..i have negative coordinates value for example pointf(300,-250) this method is not drawing nothing for negative coordinates value..so please give me brief solution because i don't know much about drawing...thank you"
