"why does sortedlist implementation use throwhelper instead of throwing directly? reflector tells me that sortedlist uses a throwhelper class to throw exceptions instead of throwing them directly, for example:..public tvalue this[tkey key].{.    get.    {.        int index = this.indexofkey(key);.        if (index &gt;= 0).            return this.values[index];.        throwhelper.throwkeynotfoundexception();.        return default(tvalue);.    }...where throwkeynotfoundexception does nothing more than just:..throw new keynotfoundexception();...note how this requires a duff statement ""return default(tvalue)"" which is unreachable. i must conclude that this is a pattern with benefits large enough to justify this...what are these benefits?"
