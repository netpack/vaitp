"class instantiation from the main or through a method i know this is too silly a question. but i am a learner and class business is difficult for me. ..i am presenting code-1 and below that code-2. i would like to know if both serves the same purpose and the difference exists only in the presentation...i raise this doubt because up to this point i used to do everything in the main rather than have a different method within the class program...code-1...namespace trial1.{.    class program.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            program p = new program();.            p.instanceequal();.        }.        public void instanceequal().        {.            string name = ""unnikrishnan"";.            employeename emp1 = new employeename(name);.        }.    }.    public class employeename.    {.        string _name;.        public employeename(string name).        {.            _name = name;.        }.    }.}...code-2...namespace trial1.{.    class program.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            program p = new program();.            employeename emp1 = new employeename(""unnikrishnan"");.        }.    }.    public class employeename.    {.        string _name;.        public employeename(string name).        {.            _name = name;.        }.    }.}"
