"how to retrieve the directory in which the current class/dll is located in blank? one of my classes, to execute some instructions needs to know its location (as an absolute path). i was using a naive directory.getcurrentdirectory(), until i noticed that things get messed up when the user is actually not executing from the directory where the class is sitting...how can i get that ? so far my googling is unfructuous... :(..ps : i intend to release this class as a dll, no com or anything fancy, just a basic dll. will that change any rule?"
