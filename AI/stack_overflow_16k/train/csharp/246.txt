"how do i store references to elements of a 2d array? i'm checking each element of a 2d array for specific conditionals..if the element is true i want to check it's direct neighboring adjacent elements..if the neighboring elements are false i want to keep track of them, lets call these ""validelements"". .once all elements have been checked i want to pick one of the validelements at random and make it true, then clear that collection of validelements and repeat this process an arbitrary amount of times...i know how to check each element and their neighbors for the conditionals but i'm not sure the proper way to keep track of the references to elements that are considered ""validelements"". how should i keep track of this data?..public bool [,] grid = new bool [3,3];..// lets make the middle element true so we have a starting point. ..grid[grid.getlength(0) / 2, grid.getlength(1) / 2] = true;..for (int row = 0; row &lt; grid.getlength(0); row++).{.    for (int col = 0; col &lt; grid.getlength(1); col++).    {.        if (grid[row, col]).        {.            // if neighboring cells are false keep track of them somehow.        }.    }.}"
