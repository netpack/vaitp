can i have a class within a class in blank i have the following class:..public class notelink.{..    public ilist&lt;notelinkdetail&gt; notelinkdetails.    {.        get { return _notelinkdetails; }.    }.    private list&lt;notelinkdetail&gt; _notelinkdetails = new list&lt;notelinkdetail&gt;();..    public notelink().    {.        _notelinkdetails = new list&lt;notelinkdetail&gt;();.    }..}...and then another class that's used just within the first class...public class notelinkdetail.{.    public string l { get; set; }.    public string r { get; set; }.}...is there anything i could do to optimize this. i do need the second class as i use json to store the contents of notelinkdetail in a string. however is there such a thing as an inner class in blank?  any recommendation on how i could optimize this code? thanks.
