"populate a blank object with random values i want to populate an object with random data at runtime...there are lots of tools (like nbuilder) but the rely on generics and i don't know the object's type until runtime...any ideas?..edit: this has nothing to do with testing or test data. i have a wcf service, and for any data contract type i want to deserialize it to xml and json and display the output. the deserialized output can then be used by other developers and testers as a reference guide...if the object is not populated the deserialized output is not meaningful...i don't want to build proxies, or use wsdl etc...i got nbuilder working with reflection. but its only populating value types?"
