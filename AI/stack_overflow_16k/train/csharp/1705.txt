randomly assign employee day off within a week i have an application that will assign employee in their designated task. the problem is how can i randomly assign day-off day within a week for each employee. the system must work with at least 7 employees. ..example:..employee | day off.emp 1    | sun.emp 2    | wed.emp 3    | tue.emp 4    | mon.emp 5    | thu.emp 6    | sat.emp 7    | fri...but if the number of employee goes higher than the default. there must be alteast 1 day with 2 employee with day-off...example 1 with additional 1 employee..employee | day off.emp 1    | sun.emp 2    | wed.emp 3    | tue.emp 4    | mon.emp 5    | thu.emp 6    | sat.emp 7    | fri.emp 8    | tue...example 2 with additional 2 employees..employee | day off.emp 1    | tue.emp 2    | thu.emp 3    | sun.emp 4    | mon.emp 5    | wed.emp 6    | fri.emp 7    | sat.emp 8    | tue.emp 9    | sun...example 3 with additional 3 employees..employee | day off.emp 1    | thu.emp 2    | sat.emp 3    | fri.emp 4    | mon.emp 5    | sun.emp 6    | wed.emp 7    | tue.emp 8    | tue.emp 9    | sun.emp 10   | wed...and so on....i want the system to generate this randomly. is there any code algorithm that will resolve this problem? thanks!...  update...this is what i tried...// note that getactiveemployee() returns list&lt;employee&gt; object..list&lt;employee&gt; activeemployees = this.getactiveemployees(); ..list&lt;employee&gt; assignedemployees = new list&lt;employee&gt;();..// set collection of employee which has no day off .// from active employee list..list&lt;employee&gt; hasnooffemployees = new list&lt;employee&gt;();.hasnooffemployees = activeemployees; ..//  7 days a week..// assumption: start dayofweek is sunday..for (int x = 0; x &lt; 7; x++).{.     // get random employee from hasnooffemployees..     int eidx = rnd.next(hasnooffemployees.count);.     employee selemphasoff = hasnooffemployees[eidx];..     foreach (employee employee in activeemployees).     {.          if (selemphasoff == employee).          {.               assignedemployees.add(employee);.               hasnooffemployees.remove(selemphasoff);.               break;.          }.     }.}...the given result of day-off will always be like this...examples:..a - with 7 actual employees..employee | day off.emp 2    | sun.emp 4    | mon.emp 3    | tue.emp 1    | wed.emp 7    | thu.emp 6    | fri.emp 5    | sat...b - with 8 actual employees...employee | day off.emp 7    | sun.emp 6    | mon.emp 5    | tue.emp 4    | wed.emp 3    | thu.emp 8    | fri.emp 2    | sat...c - with 9 actual employees...employee | day off.emp 8    | sun.emp 3    | mon.emp 9    | tue.emp 4    | wed.emp 6    | thu.emp 7    | fri.emp 2    | sat...and so on.....there is always a missing employee/s.
