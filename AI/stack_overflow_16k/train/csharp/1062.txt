"separate numbers with comma i had a task to display the numbers, which are divided into 3 and 5. i have them are displayed, but it is necessary so that they are output separated by commas...console.writeline(""write number greater than 0: "");.            string input = console.readline();.            int n;.            if (int.tryparse(input, out n)).            {.                for (int i = 1; i &lt; n + 1; i++).                {.                    if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0).                        console.write(""{0} "", i);.                }.            }...string.join("" , "", i) doesn't work...i am very sorry for such a question, but i am a beginner, i looked everywhere, but i did not find it anywhere..after the last number should not be a comma."
