"cefsharp exit when detecting cookie? i'm using cefsharp to ask the user to login, and i want to automatically detect when a certain url and cookie is set. ..i found this way for the cookies:..class webview_cookies : icookievisitor.    {.        public bool visit(cookie cookie, int count, int total, ref bool deletecookie).        {.            console.writeline(cookie.name +"" = "" +  cookie.value);..            return true;.        }.    }..webview_cookies o = new webview_cookies();..            cef.visitallcookies(o);...however cef.visitallcookies is synchronous... meaning that i won't know when the cookie is created. ..what can i do?"
