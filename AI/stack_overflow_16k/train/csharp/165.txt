"lazy or not to use the new keyword without assigning the result? i always enjoy learning new approaches and coding methods. my question relates to the use of the ""new"" keyword.  would one consider using the new keyword without assignment fair practice?..   var example1 = new item();.   example.add(testobject);  //ok..   //using initializer ....   var example2 = new item.   {.       title= ""this is the title"",.       summary = ""this is the summary"".   }; //fine again .....   //but my question relates to using the new keyword like thus ...  ..   new item().add(testobject);...i personally am not keen on the last approach, to me it seems a little lazy and messy haha, but are there any drawbacks or issues associated with using the new .keyword in this manner? i don't think there are as the garbage collector will clean up but would like a little advice here?"
