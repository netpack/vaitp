"angle between three vector points i have three vector points where i want to get the angle of one of the vertices..i tried to use the law of cosines - cos c = (a² + b² - c²)/2ab, but i get non accurate results.here is my getangle() method..public static float getangle(vector2 vec1, vector2 vec2, vector2 vec3).{.    float lenghta = mathf.sqrt(vec1.x * vec1.x + vec1.y * vec1.y);.    float lenghtb = mathf.sqrt(vec2.x * vec2.x + vec2.y * vec2.y);.    float lenghtc = mathf.sqrt(vec3.x * vec3.x + vec3.y * vec3.y);..    float calc = ((lenghta * lenghta) + (lenghtb * lenghtb) - (lenghtc * lenghtc)) / (2 * lenghta * lenghtb);..    return mathf.acos(calc) * mathf.rad2deg;.}...given that i insert the three vectors:..vec1 = new vector2(1,1);.vec2 = new vector2(1,5);.vec3 = new vector2(5,5);...where i want to find the angle of vec3 respectively:..result: nan, then when i start moving the vectors i get sometimes inverted angles sometimes again nan.its hard to me to observe and inspect what is happening but i was thinking did i get the formula and coding right?..edit: observing more when i move vec1 to position (1,5) i get 90 degrees, further to position (1,10) i get 40 degrees.."
