how to generate a unique 4-digit string i'm looking for a way to generate a (fairly) unique (non auto-incrementing) 4-digit string using the numbers 0 - 9 for each digit using blank.  i can validate uniqueness and generate another number if a dup is found.  i had thought about basing the number somehow on the datetime object's ticks property but am having a difficult time putting the pieces together...any thoughts or expertise would be much appreciated.
