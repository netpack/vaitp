"get the original source code location for an assembly is there a way to obtain the location of an assembly's original source code location through reflection?..warning, i'm not looking for the current location of the assembly, rather the location were the source code resided when it was compiled...e.g...given: myassembly.dll.   c:program filesmyappmyassembly.dll &lt;- i'm not looking for this location. this is its current location..   d:devmyappmain.cs &lt;- this is the location i want; the location were the source code resided when it was compiled...i started with this, but i haven't been able find which rabbit hole to go down to get this info so far...assembly.getexecutingassembly().gettype(""myassembly.main"").&lt;something&gt;.....when exceptions occur in .net you'll often see the name of the class that threw the exception along with the full path to the original source code file. this is what i'm after. i realize that a .pdb symbol file may be required in order to obtain this location."
