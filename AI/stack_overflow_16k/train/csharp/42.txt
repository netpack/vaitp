"internal property and subclassing i think it is by design and there is nothing can be done about it, but i found it interesting...i needed to create a concreate class based on third-party abstract base class. as always, i told visual studio to implement abstract base class, which it did, but the code didn't compile complaining about missing getter. however, event after adding getter manualy, the code still didn't compile. it turned out that this getter is internal. funny thing about internal property is that it's not shown in metadata (view definition). vendor will make it protected in the next release, but at the time being, unless i'm missing some other way, there is nothing i can do about it, right?..-stan"
