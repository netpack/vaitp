"blank program - the login is from an untrusted domain name and cannot be used with windows authentication i have been using a blank program, which i wrote several years ago, that accesses data from a sql server (2008 r2). recently the screen on my laptop malfunctioned and the cost of replacing it was too expensive so i decided to transfer the blank program and the database to my desktop computer. visual studio 2010 was perfect. so as to not change anything i installed sql server 2008 r2 and attached the database. so far so good. using sql server i can access the database, no problem, but as soon as i run the blank program, which also runs just fine, until it tries to access the ""mdf"" file, then i get the ""the login is from an untrusted domain...."" error message. ..i have tried deleting the log file and re-attaching the mdf file, as was suggested by someone, but that didn't work. ..so any suggestions anyone?"
