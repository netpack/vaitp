"rescale array into smaller size array, preserving average values as example, i have array with size 5159..i need to scale it into 790 values, but keep them on same level. as example with smaller size: if i have [4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 5] array and scale it to array of 2 elements it will be [4 ,3] - first three average value is 4, second three became 4. but if i have array [4, 4, 4, 3, 2] i have no idea how to scale it into 2 values. because each part need average from 2.5 elements...i tried like:..private static ienumerable&lt;list&lt;byte&gt;&gt; splitlist(list&lt;byte&gt; samples, int chunks).{.    var list = new list&lt;list&lt;byte&gt;&gt;();..    var itemsperchunk = samples.count / chunks;..    for (int i = 0; i &lt; samples.count; i += itemsperchunk).    {.        list.add(samples.getrange(i, math.min(itemsperchunk, samples.count - i)));.    }..    return list;.}...but that not works, and returns 860 parts, because itemsperchunk is integer (6 instead of actual 6.53.. ). any suggestions?..edit: .to make it more clear, final goal is to scale this 5159 array into 790 array, preserving average values. ..to make it more clear: i have alot of values for drawning chart, how much is unknown until program runs. i need to make array of smaller amount of values, but with same ""shape"" as original array."
