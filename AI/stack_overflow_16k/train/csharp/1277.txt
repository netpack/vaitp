"replace dotx placeholder with complex table data we have a requirement to use microsoft word document as a template where its place-holders will be replaced. it works fine for simple place-holder replacement...however the complexity comes in, when we need to add in place-holder which will be replaced by table with number of rows depending on the data retrieved from database...currently we are doing it using blank codes by generating the data before replacing into the microsoft word template...is there any better approach for this? or can we use ssrs for to fulfil this requirement?..the end result should be the same word document with its place-holder replaced by values from database."
