"call a method dynamically based on some other variable .  possible duplicate:.  how to call method using its name?  .....getting sick of using switch/case statements.  i'm wondering if there is some way to call a method based on the value provided by the user.  understand that there could be a million reasons why this is a bad idea, but here's what i'm thinking:..console.write(""what method do you want to call? "");.string method_name = console.readline();...then somehow call the method contained in 'method_name'.  is this even possible?"
