"blank creating rectangles with different aspect ratios i am writing an application in wpf where the user defines a rectangle {x, x, w, h} in a 2d space. that's easy enough. now the next bit is where i am having difficulty. what this rectangle represents is a picture space and i need to save out two rectangles, one will keep a 1 to 3 aspect ratio while the other maintains a 1 to 4 aspect ratio. ....now, i've come up with formulas on how to get the aspect ratios (assuming it's right)..1.3 aspect ratio:.w: 2119.0.h: w / 1.3..1.4 aspect ratio:.w: h * 1.4.h: 1515.0..but what i don't know is how to i get the coordinates for both. i suspect i have to get it from the initial rectangle's coordinates somehow. but i'm not sure. any input will be greatly appreciated."
