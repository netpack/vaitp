"blank directoryinfo getfiles returns empty array i am trying to read a file from directory with blank directoryinfo.getfiles but it returns an empty array. even though there is a file in the folder, it has all the access permissions and there is no exception thrown..although, when i try to run the line in ""immediate window"" (vs 2010) it gets the file from the directory properly...i was googling but, so far i found no answer..is there something i missed? ..the code is pretty simple:..         try.        {..            directoryinfo pathdir = new directoryinfo(this.path);..            fileinfo[] files = pathdir.getfiles();..            foreach (fileinfo file in files).            {.                xmldocument xml = new xmldocument();.                xml.load(file.fullname);..                // doing something with xml here   .            }..        }.        catch (exception exc).        {.            console.writeline(""the following error has occured: "" + exc.message.tostring());.        }"
