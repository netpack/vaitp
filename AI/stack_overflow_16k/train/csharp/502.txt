"determine local uri (assembly.getentryassembly() returns null) i have a project-folder called testa, then a folder in it called testb and in that one a folder with the name testc. in testc is an image (image.png) and i want to know how to get that uri...i need to call a function and give the uri to the function..i already tried many things like:..class.function(new uri(""pack://application:,,,/testb/testc/image.png""));...but i always get this exception: ..assembly.getentryassembly() returns null...i am pretty sure, that this part isnÂ´t correct: ""pack://application:,,,/testb/testc/image.png""..thanks for any suggestions :)"
