"is writing interfaces to aid testing a good practice? the project i work on has multiple layers and each layer's object is being used in the subsequent layer. but some of the classes do not have any interfaces and have non virtual methods. so basically i will not be able to use a mock framework to stud those classes from other layers. when i asked the developer to create an interface for the same class, so that i can mock it, he asked me why should i create an interface if i am not going to reuse it..is it a good practice to write interface just to improve the testability of the code?"
