"error the name 'inumber' does not exist in the current context - how does it not exist? i was programming a blank program, where i got this error""..error   1   the name 'inumber' does not exist in the current context..for this line..console.writeline(inumber + ""/"" + i + ""="" + d);...looking over the code, i don't understand how inumber doesn't exist. i understand what the error means, but for inumber to not exists, then the try catch would have failed, meaning that code that had the error wouldnt run.....could someone explain to me why inumber won't exist?.. try.            {.                inumber = convert.toint32(console.readline());...                for (int i = 1; i &lt; inumber; i++).                {.                    decimal d;.                    d = inumber / i;...                    if (((d % 1) == 0)).                    {.                        if (!numbercount.contains(d)).                        {.                            numbercount.add(d);.                            console.writeline(inumber + ""/"" + i + ""="" + d);.                        }.                    }...                }..            }.catch.{.}"
