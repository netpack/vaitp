"how to check if multiple buttons where clicked in an alphabet soup game everyone..i have this assignment at school where i have to make one of those alphabet puzzle games where you find a word in an alphabet soup. i don't really know the name for it. ..i have 70 buttons. for example button12, button13, button14 and button 14 form the word ""hola"". as soon as people click those four buttons i want them (those four buttons) to be disabled, except if people clicked on another button which wasn't part of the word. i know i could program each button assigning a value to a variable and upping that value when i click the button. the problem is that i'd prefer not to do this on all 70 buttons since there are other requirements for the assignment and the code would be too long...i tried a bunch of stuff but i've since then erased the code out of frustration...this is an image of my form: enter image description here..private void button_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        button mybutton = (button)sender;..        mybutton.forecolor = system.drawing.color.red;..    }...i have that event in all my buttons because i have to change the text color on each button when i click on them. ..edit: i did put all the buttons manually"
