"pass any method of an object as a paramter in a function the title is may be not clear enough, but i'll show you a short program in order to make you understand what i want to do:..class program.{.   private static obj a = new obj(...);..   private static void function(anymethodofmyobject() m).   {.      object[] result = a.m();.      ....   }..   static void main().   {.      double a,b,c = 0;.      string d = "" "";.      function(methodx(a,b,c));.      function(methody(d,a,b));.      .....   }.}...the methods will always return the same type which is an object[], but i don't have the same number/type of argument. ..thanks !"
