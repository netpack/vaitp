"calculate percentage if percentage sign is in the text my project has a textbox field which is named as txtdisc. i need to minus the entered value from another textbox called txttotal. the problem is i need to minus the percentage if i enter the percentage sign. for example, if my total value is 1000 and my discount value is 2 then i need the answer as 998 and if the entered value is 2% i need the value as 980. i used _textchanged event for the calculation...my code is:..private void txtdiscount_textchanged(object sender, eventargs e).{.  if (txtdiscount.text.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; lbltotal.text != """").  {.    decimal net = 0, total = 0, discount = 0;.    total = convert.todecimal(lbltotal.text);.    discount = convert.todecimal(txtdiscount.text);.    net =total- discount;.    lblnetamount.text = net.tostring();.  }.}"
