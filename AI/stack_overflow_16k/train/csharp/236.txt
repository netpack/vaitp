"if (integer console.readline """" or null) doesn't work i can't figure out after searching and searching (you know how it goes) why this code doesn't work...i just want it to work like this ..if (nummer == """") {.    console.writeline(""0"");.}...that's it, and it doesn't work. i have been searching for an hour and a half. can't understand why there is a simple basic explanation. i only found how to fix it with a string or something, then i tried to convert it and it still didn't work. can someone help me please?..i appreciate your patience for my limited knowledge. thanks for your time..static void main(string[] args).{.    bool herhaal = true;..    do.    {                .        console.write(""geef een getal : "");.        int nummer = convert.toint16(console.readline());           ..        if (console.readline() == """" &amp;&amp; console.readline() == null).        {.            console.writeline(""0"");.        }..        double kw = math.pow(nummer, 2);..        console.writeline(""kwadraat van {0} is: {1}"", nummer, kw + environment.newline);.    } while (herhaal);.}"
