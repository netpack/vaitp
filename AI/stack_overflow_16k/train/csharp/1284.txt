"how do i stop the spinning cursor in a long process i wrote a blank program that lets a user drag and drop a file name from a folder into a text box, after that the program will then run a long process to search all the subdirectory(s) for the name. the problem i have is when it does that, it change the cursor to the ""+"" and i can't do anything else in that folder.  is there a way to not having the cursor change to ""+"" and let the user continue working in that folder? thanks in advance."
