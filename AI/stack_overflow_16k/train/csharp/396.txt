"can i force anonymous type in method signature? i can already hear the close vote clicks... lol, oh well...ok so i wrote a method that took a dictionary but then i got this idea to just pass an anonymous type instead so the method calls are less verbose, and then i just convert it to a dictionary in the method...however, after this update the compiler is not going to point out to me any calls that are still passing a dictionary since the parameter is just an object...so i just started wondering if there's a way to enforce the type as anonymous? i actually feel fairly certain the answer is no and if someone just wants to post an answer that simply says ""no"" (followed by enough characters to be accepted as an answer... and perhaps letting me know how ridiculous my request is while you're at it as well) then i will happily mark that as the answer...was just curious enough i had to ask though. don't hate me for it! :)"
