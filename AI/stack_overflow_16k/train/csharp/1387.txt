"are there any special requirements for resolving namespaces for sealed classes? i have created a sealed class called transactions with some static methods and compiled it successfully. i then created a test project to test the functionality of all my methods and added a reference to the dll file of the sealed class. ..when i begin typing the namespace of the class in my test project, intellisense resolves the reference and adds it...i can even type the class name and intellisense provides the complete list of public methods and properties for the class, but when i attempt to compile the project i get the error ""the type or namespace name 'transactions' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)"" ..when i double-click the error it points to the namespace reference at the top of my code. if i remove the namespace i get a question mark when i hover over my method call prompting to add the namespace that i just removed. what the ???..so on one account it complains that it can't find the namespace during compilation, and on the other if i remove the namespace it recognizes the dependency of the method and wants me to add it back. i am stuck literally between a rock and a hard place...my only suspicion is the use of the sealed class that is causing the issue because if i create another class (not sealed) and add the same method the issue goes away...thoughts or advice would be appreciated. this is the .net 4.0 framework"
