"how should i set up my private variables when i move them into a base class? i have the following code in all of my controllers:..public class packagescontroller : basecontroller.{.    private iaccountservice _account;.    private idatasourceservice _datasource;.    private ipackageservice _package;.    private iproductservice _product;.    private icontentservice _content;.    private isequenceservice _sequence;...they all inherit from basecontroller.  i'm a bit confused about the difference between public, private and protected.  i am thinking i could move these into basecontroller. if i did this then should i use private, protected or is there some other modifier."
