"is this possible to create subdirectory in ftp using ftp.makedirectory? i have to create this query to get some answer before i change my code.pardon me if this question is doesn't make sense to you guys...scenario 1:..string path :ftp://1.1.1.1/mpg/test"";.ftpwebrequest requestdir = (ftpwebrequest)ftpwebrequest.create(new uri(path));.requestdir.credentials = new networkcredential(""sh"",""se"");.requestdir.method = webrequestmethods.ftp.makedirectory;...using the same code to create the directory structure to connect my local filezilla ftp server to do the job---works fine...scenario 2:.used the above code to connect the remote ftp server to do the same job throws exception : error 550 no file found or no access...question 1 : i have a full permission to read/write for the folder,if its not a permission issue,what else i have to keep it in mind to look for it ?..question 2: if i modified my code like.step1: make""mpg"" direcotry first.step2: make""test"" directory after that,works fine.is that mean ftp.makedirectory won't support to create a subdirectory in the main dir ?..if that's the case how it created in my local ftp server ?..any help appreciated...thanks in advance."
