"how to not include data in a text file if it is already in there i want to add data into a text file based on a specific output, it will read an xml file and write a certain line to a text file. if the data is already written into the text file, i dont want to write it again...code:..public void output(string folder).{.    string s = ""data"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yyyymmddhhmm"") + "".xml"";.    //trades.save(s);.    string path = path.combine(folder, s);.    console.writeline(path);.    xdocument f = new xdocument(trades);..    f.save(path);..    string[] lines = file.readalllines(path);.    file.writealllines(path, lines);..    using (system.io.streamwriter file = new system.io.streamwriter(@""h:test"" + datetime.now.tostring(""yymmdd"") + "".txt"", true)).    {.        foreach (string line in lines).        {.            if (line.contains(""certaindata"")).            {.                file.writeline(line);.                if (file.readalllines(path).any(x =&gt; x.equals(line))).                {.                }.                else.                {.                    string[] tradereflines = file.readalllines(path);.                    file.writealllines(path, tradereflines); ;.                }..            }.        }.    }.}...the problem is it will still write the line even if the data is exactly the same elsewhere. i don't want duplicate lines..any advice?..clarification update..the ""certaindata"" is a reference number..i have a bunch of files that has data in it and the piece i want to seperate and put into a text file is ""certaindata"" field, which will have a reference number..sometimes the files i get sent will have the same formatted information inside it with the ""certaindata"" appearing in their for reference..when i run this programme, if the text file i have already contains the ""certaindata"" reference number inside it, i dont want it to be written..if you need anymore clarification let me know and i will update the post"
