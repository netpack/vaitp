"why i cannot call the default constructor while having a private constructor? i have the following class with a private overloaded constructor.. class car.    {.        string _make;.        string _model;..        car(string make, string model).        {.            _make = make;.            _model = model;.        }.    }...then i've tried to call the default constructor of the above class..class daytona.{.    public int foo().    {.        car c = new car(); //compilation error..        return 0;.    }.}...note both classes are in the same namespace!..i could not create an instance of the car using its default constructor. but either i create a default constructor or not i should be able to access the default constructor. but i why this error occurred?..okay fellows, something bad happened with vs 2010, when i restarted my machine vs 2010 compiled the above code. so that problem was solved...its my compiler, when i recompiled it, again brought the error, in line "" car c = new car();"" error was mynamespace.car.car(string, string) is inaccessible due to its protection level..but i want to drag this top to a new area, why would someone want to create a private constructor? (the above code just for testing!)"
