"using list<keyvaluepair> to store keys and values i'm still trying to understand keyvaluepairs but i believe this idea should work.  in my code below it searchs through a large string and extracts 2 substrings.  one substring (keep in mind the value between the quotes varies) is something like identity=""ednusername"" another substring is something like frameworksiteid=""desoto""  so i was thinking about combining these strings together before i added them to the list but here is my problem.. the login string below is a unique field of strings that i need to use in a sql statement to select records in sqlserver and the framew strings are strings i need lined up with the login strings (and all the columns and rows of data coming from sqlserver) when i output this to a text file.  should i make the login strings keys and the framew strings values?  if so how do i do that??  hope that makes sense.  i can further explain if needs be..regex reg = new regex(""identity=""[^""]*"""");.regex reg1 = new regex(""frameworksiteid=""[^""]*"""");..foreach (fileinfo file in files).{.    string line = """";.    using (streamreader sr = new streamreader(file.fullname)).    {.        while (!string.isnullorempty(line = sr.readline())).        {.            if (line.toupper().contains(""identity="")).            {.                string login = reg.match(line).groups[0].value;.                string framew = reg1.match(line).groups[0].value; //added.                identitylines.add(new keyvaluepair&lt;string, string&gt;(file.name, login + "" "" + framew));.                    //this is probably not what i need.            }...            else.            {.                identitylines.add(new keyvaluepair&lt;string, string&gt;(file.name, ""no login""));.            }.        }"
