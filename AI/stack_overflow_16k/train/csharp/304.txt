"file not found error in blank i have some interesting error in blank while reading a txt file after a process ran. this process run some operations and after it finishes, copy its output to a txt file. this txt file shown below as output.txt. ..when i'm trying to run it it throws an error called file not found. but if i try to debug it with pressing f10 file can be found and everything works fine. ..i guess that problem occurs when code runs while process working in the background. code requires txt file but process still working. and error thrown...here its my code...var aprioriprocess = new processstartinfo();.aprioriprocess.useshellexecute = true;..string supportvalue = t_minsupport.text;.string workingdirectory = appdomain.currentdomain.basedirectory;.string outputfile = ""output.txt"";..int index = workingdirectory.indexof(""bin"");..if (index &gt; 0).{.    workingdirectory = workingdirectory.remove(index, 10);.}..if (file.exists(workingdirectory + ""/output.txt"")).{.    file.delete(workingdirectory + ""/output.txt"");.}..//proc1.workingdirectory = @""c:usersberkidocumentsvisual studio 2017projectsdataminingdatamining"";.aprioriprocess.workingdirectory = workingdirectory;.aprioriprocess.filename = @""c:windowssystem32cmd.exe"";..string command = ""-s"" + supportvalue + "" census.dat - &gt;&gt; "" + outputfile;.aprioriprocess.arguments = ""/c apriori.exe "" + command;..process.start(aprioriprocess);..string filename = outputfile;.filereader.readfile(workingdirectory + filename);.apriorilines = filereader.getentries().cast&lt;apriorioutput&gt;().tolist();...maybe not deleting it but updating that txt file will solve my problem but im not sure. ..thanks"
