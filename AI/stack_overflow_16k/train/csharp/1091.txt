"is assigning a list<int> to ienumerable<int> beneficial or not? the language i use is blank...say that a method of an object returns a list&lt;int&gt;. if we assign this result to a variable of type ienumerable&lt;int&gt; would we benefit anything or not?..in other words..ienumerable&lt;int&gt; result = list...is better than ..list&lt;int&gt; result = list,..where list is a list&lt;int&gt;...i think intuitively that we will not benefit anything. however, i would like to be sure. hence i am asking this."
