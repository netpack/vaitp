"de-format currency in blank i have a string value coming from a label in the .aspx page as following...string text = price.text; // price.text = ""$31.07"".single value = convert.tosingle(text); //throws formatexception...i can replace the $ sign with the empty text and then convert to single but i was wondering if there is better way to de-format the text with the '$' sign into a single."
