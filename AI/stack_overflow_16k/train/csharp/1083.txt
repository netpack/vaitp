"what is the best way for on demand download and install of dlls in .net? we have an application that we wish to install just a basic shell for. as the users use it, it will download and install the necessary dlls for actions that need to take place (imagine a wizard application scenario with several possible paths). currently, everything is installed for all possible paths through the shell app...for about 3 months out of the year, the dlls used for the possible paths go through a high churn rate with updates, so we wish to start ensuring the users have the most recent version of these dlls. the idea is that after all their selections are made, we'd make a web check to see what dlls are required for their selection and check to make sure they have the most recent version of those files. ..all of this we have a plan for on how to do it. the problem i'm fighting is what is the most appropriate way to ""install"" these files. clickonce is not an option...too much legacy stuff here. our app is installed in ""program files"" which obviously has restrictions for writing random files into the program's install folder under vista and later...right now i see the options as the following:...on install mark the install directory as writable for the ""everyone"" group. i haven't actually tested to see if this would work yet, or if vista does something different in this scenario..split the download portion out into a second app that we can have prompt for elevated privileges so that it can download and install these files....i'm leaning towards the second option since that maintains the security aspect of the program files folder. others in the group lean towards the first option because they just don't want to have to worry about things. or is there some other option i'm missing?..the app is a .net app, though it has some requirements of third party dlls that are not managed assemblies."
