"static class, static constructors and static properties i have a static class that has only static properties and a static constructor. when i try to access or set the value of property (with a backing field) the static constructor is not called. however, if i define a static method and try to call it the constructor is executed...i believe properties are just syntactical sugar and are internally translated as methods. so why does the runtime treats them differently? my class define is given below:..edit: i have removed the code where i was initializing the value of _fileencodingtext inline...edit: the constructor is called but the property is not set. this is probably because ""a static constructor runs exactly zero or one times, and runs before a static method call or instance creation in its type"". igor ostrovsky and eric lippert have explained it in their blogs...http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/05/03/10159682.aspx.http://ericlippert.com/2013/01/31/the-no-lock-deadlock/..internal static class appsettings.{.    static appsettings().    {.        fileencodingtext = ""utf8"";.    }..private static string _fileencodingtext;.public static string fileencodingtext.{.    get { return _fileencodingtext; }.    set.    {.        string oldvalue = _fileencodingtext;.        _fileencodingtext = value;..        try.        {.            fileencoding = encoding.getencoding(value);.        }.        catch (system.exception).        {.            _fileencodingtext = oldvalue;.            fileencoding = encoding.utf8;.        }.    }.}..public static encoding fileencoding { get; private set; }...}"
