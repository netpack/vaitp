"design reasons behind making toupper a static method on char in blank, we have this non-static method on the type string:..""abc"".toupper()...but for char, we need to use a static method:..char.toupper('a')...when introducing blank to beginners, they always expect to be able to write the following:..'a'.toupper()...does anyone have insights as why it was designed like this?..the only thing i can think of is performance but then i would have expected a static toupper() for the type string too."
