"blank converting a streamreader string to a double i'm trying to read in each line and determine whether the line contains a specific string ""donated"" or any double number....if the string ""donated"" is found, increment a variable by 1..if a double is found, add the value to the variable....however, i have 1 problem: when i convert the string to a double using dconverted, it outputs the numbers as a set of string being added together. for example, if it read 3 lines, each containing the number 1, i would end up with the total of ""111"" instead of ""3""...here is my code :..double dconverted;.string sline= """";.string dcount = """";.int isponsors = 0;.string swords = ""donated"";..using (streamreader sr = new streamreader(""donations.txt"")).{.    while (sr.peek() != -1).    {.        sline = sr.readline();      // read in the line.        if (sline.contains(swords)) // if line contains donation text, add another sponsor.        {.            isponsors++; // increment sponsor amount.        }.        else // if sline does not contain donated.        {.            dconverted = convert.todouble(sline);.            dcount = dcount + dconverted; // store the numbers in a variable.        }.        console.writeline(sline); // write the line to console.        console.writeline();.    }.    console.writeline(""total amount sponsored: "" + dcount);.}.console.writeline();.console.writeline(""enter any key"");.console.readkey();...the question is; how do i end up with a totalled number instead of multiple strings being added together?"
