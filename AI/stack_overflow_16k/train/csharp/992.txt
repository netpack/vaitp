"getting variable type and variable info from console.writeline basically i'm trying to make it so i can do ..console.writeline(""variable : value"");.var stuff = console.readline();...and then use the first word of ""stuff"" to be the variable type int,string etc. and the rest of the line to be what the variable's value is, so like..string testing this..would make a variable i made into a string and the value be ""testing this"""
