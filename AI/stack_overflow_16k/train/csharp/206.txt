is this possible with ilist i have a public class called profile. very simple model class currently with 2 properties;  string name and string fields. as i develop the project the class will expand but it's not particularly important at the moment...i have a global static ilist of type profile called profiles. i am quite new to manipulating the data in these ienumerable types but i am looking to update one of the properties of a single profile. i have tried the following but i am receiving an object reference not set exception. the following is where i set the property:..profiles.single(x =&gt; x.name == listboxprofiles.text).fields = textboxfieldname.text;...the debugger is showing the listbox and textbox text properties both have the correct values so i think that it is the way i am using single that is wrong...if anyone could shed some light i would be grateful.
