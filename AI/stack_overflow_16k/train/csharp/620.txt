"output computation strategy problem maybe not the best title i can think of but my problem is this:..i have to design a blank application which takes a bunch of inputs, perform some computation on the input according to a bunch of rules to get a set of results...the problem is that the rules can change as an when required. to complicate things, many of them are cross tab look ups and conditionals. for example,..public string rule_getfruitforthisseason(hamper design).{.    // crosstab of 2 properties of values 400 to 100 and 600 to 500 respectively..    if(design.pty1 &gt; 400 &amp;&amp; design.pty &gt; 600) return ""apple"";.    else if(design.pty1 &gt; 200 &amp;&amp; design.pty &gt; 600) return ""pear"";.    else if(design.pty1 &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; design.pty &gt; 600) return ""orange"";.    else if(design.pty1 &gt; 400 &amp;&amp; design.pty &gt; 500) return ""grape"";.    else if(design.pty1 &gt; 200 &amp;&amp; design.pty &gt; 500) return ""berry"";.    else if(design.pty1 &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; design.pty &gt; 500) return ""peach"";.}...and then during the next season, all the fruits might change again! (even the conditionals may change.) ideally, i don't want the programmer to change the fruits every season. the hamper designers should be able to do it themselves...worse still there could be rules that depend on the output for example..public string rule_getboxforfruit(string fruit).{.   if(fruit == ""apple"" || fruit == ""pear"" || fruit == ""orange"" || fruit == ""peach"") return ""big box"";.   else return ""small box"";.}...i have been thinking through various methods and currently i am using excel for its lookup() and generally ability to evaluate formulas, and then directly reading the excel results. but it is still a huge cumbersome task...anyone has any ideas on how to approach this in a better way? thank you."
