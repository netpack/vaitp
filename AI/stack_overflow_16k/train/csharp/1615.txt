"simplest and best way to display a list of items on windows form application using blank at my school i was handed a project for my blank course. it's a fairly simple project but i don't know how to go about doing it or even start doing it. so i'll just get to it then....  i am supposedly a developer hired by a book company that needs a developer to code an application for them to work on one machine in the work place. .  .  users should be able to do the following with the application:.  .  .  view a list of books, as well as a list of audio publications.  create new records for books and audio.  .  .  the application should adhere to the following specifications:.  .  .  it must be windows form.  it must be user friendly and easy to navigate.  data should be saved to a file when application closes and be read back into it when it opens.  it must perform appropriate input validation.  it must be well designed and support future changes and the business is growing.  .  .  the following data needs to be stored about the publications:.  .  book:.  .  .  publish date.  title.  author.  isbn number.  type of book (enum).  type of over (enum).  .  .  audio:.  .  .  publish date.  title.  artist.  number of tracks.  total length.  type of audio (enum).  ...i need to make use of object-orientated programming concepts such as classes, properties, methodes, inheritance and polymorphism...basically what i need to know is how should i display the information on the form and what is the best way to create new records of that info and what format to save it in. ..we haven't learnt anything about grids, so i doubt it's that. we have only learnt how to read/write from text files. also i suspect that i need to create a class for all the publications and create two child classes for the book and audio in order to handle the data that is different between them."
