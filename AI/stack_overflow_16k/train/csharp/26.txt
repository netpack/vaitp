"blank, can i move dictionary initial code out from the constructor? here is my code right now. but i would like to move those ""add"" out from the constructor. can we initialize dictionary when we new it? or you have another better idea. basically i want to define few characters which are used in many places...public class user.    {.        public enum actionenum.        {.            in,.            out,.            fail.        }..        public static dictionary&lt;actionenum, string&gt; loginaction = new dictionary&lt;actionenum, string&gt;();..        public user().        {.            loginaction.add(actionenum.in, ""i"");.            loginaction.add(actionenum.out, ""o"");.            loginaction.add(actionenum.fail, ""f"");...        }. ......}"
