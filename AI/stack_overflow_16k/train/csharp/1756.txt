difference between 2 dates showing wrong result i'm trying to build a project and trying to compare between two dates from the date time picker...let's say it's departure and arrival time. the user chooses the date 5/11/2016 on departure and 6/11/2016 on arrival...the code is below:..datetime departure = dtpdeparture.value.date;.datetime arrival = dtparrival.value.date;..messagebox.show(departure- arrival).days.tostring();...the result is: 6576 which is wrong.. it should be 1 (the difference is one day only)?..thanks for the help.
