"blank ""if this, then don't execute this"" - is there such a thing? for example: ..if (riflesradio.checked == true || smgsradio.checked == true || heavysradio.checked == true).//then don't execute below.{.    if (secondarylist.enabled == false).    {.        secondary = """";.        secondarycost = 0;.    }..    if (heavylist.enabled == false).    {.        heavys = """";.        heavycost = 0;.    }..    if (primarylist.enabled == false).    {.        rifles = """";.        riflecost = 0;.    }..    if (smglist.enabled == false).    {.        smgs = """";.        smgcost = 0;.    }.}.//up to here...so basically, in my windows form, if these buttons are being checked, then don't execute the lines below. ..i don't know if this is a possible solution, but here is a gif example of what is wrong: http://i.imgur.com/bdx53qc.gifv.after selecting the first item, it shows the pricing correctly. however, when i move to another radio to enable the other drop list, then enable the previous list, it shows the pricing as 0. .i know this is caused by the code i have pasted above, but what would be the solution to this?..thank you"
