"find nearest position to target position by a specific distance i have two positions and want to calculate the position where the red star is. (i want to move b to the ""red star location"" but i don't know the coordinates.)....i have the position of a and b and a minimum distance from position a. so my question is how do i calculate the nearest position to b within the specified distance...hope someone understand what i'm trying to accomplish."
