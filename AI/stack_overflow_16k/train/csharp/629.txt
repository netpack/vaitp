blank method as parameter where method contains ref paramater i have got the following method..public static void method1(ref list&lt;int&gt; list).{//code to update list}...is it possible to create a method that takes this method as a parameter similar to (but instead of action&lt; list> it uses action&lt; ref list>).. public static void method2(action&lt;list&lt;int&gt;&gt; othermethod).    {var newlist = new list&lt;int&gt;(); othermethod(newlist)}...my main problem is that my method uses reference while action> does not take references. is this possible?
