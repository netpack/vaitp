how to compare two objects excluding a single object property? i need to avoid duplication in a list for that i used the below code . i would like to know whether there is any option to compare the objects as (item = findobject) except item.id . i dont want to type the entire property list here. please suggest a better method...var result =(obj.find(item =&gt; (item== findobject)));
