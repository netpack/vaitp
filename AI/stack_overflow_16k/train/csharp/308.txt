"overloading inherited abstract method i'm having a conceptual problem here, i have like this:..abstract class a.{  abstract setsomething(bool f1, bool f2);} ..class c : a {setsomethng(bool f1, bool f2){/*implementation*/}}..class b : a {setsomething(bool f1, bool f2, bool f3){/*implementation*/} !! error...i'm trying to change the signature of the ""setsomething"" method in the subclass ""b"" but it gives me an error that the subclass b doesn't implement the base abstract class, is there anyway to do this? i mean to overload an inherited abstract method?"
