"object value changing i am facing an issue while maintaining object's state...i have a struct as follows;..public struct mystruct.{.    public string viewtype;.    public object objcb;.}...// usage of struct type in the program..list&lt;mystruct&gt; mylist; //global list..mystruct mystr; //global struct object...in one of the event functions i am filling this struct object as follows;..private void onclick(object sender, eventargs e).{.    mystr = new mystruct();.    mystr.objcb = sender; //filling object value in struct object.}...then in another method i am inserting this struct object in a list:..private void btnsave_click(object sender, routedeventargs e).{.    mystr.viewtype = (rbline.ischecked == true) ? ""singleline"" : ""area"";.    mylist.add(mystr);.}...the problem is, that my previous objcb value in list is changed whenever  onclick event is been called (reason could be i am having reference of sender object in list)...i tried cloning an object with memberwisecopy, but it is still giving same problem...how can i tackle with this problem?"
