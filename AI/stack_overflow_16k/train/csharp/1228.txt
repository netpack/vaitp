"date-check with non-string return type - design public static bool checkexpired().{.    datetime expirydate, currentdate = datetime.today;.    datetime.tryparse(date, out expirydate);..    if (expirydate &gt; currentdate).    {.        return true;.    }.    else { return false; }.}...this is what i have now. however, i'd like there to be a third option for if a date isn't formatted correctly. as it is now, it jumps straight to the else and returns false...the problem is that i want three possible results:..true --> has not expired..false --> has expired..third --> invalid date entered..i'm just stuck on how i get there. i know i could easily just use a string return type, but is there any way around that?"
