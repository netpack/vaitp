"dictionary with limited number of types first, excuse the rather funny name of my question. i'm no native speaker and it took me 10 minutes to express my thoughts in these few characters...what i'm trying to do is to create a dictionary in blank that allows the value to be either an int, a string or a bool. what first had come to my mind was using generics, but as far as i know, i can only define one type as possible value-type, not ""be one of those"". using object would also be possible, but boxing seems to be quite a performance-killer...is there any way to do this?..here's a sample of what has come to my mind:..dictionary&lt;string, (string, int, bool)&gt; foo = new dictionary&lt;string, (string, int, bool)&gt;();.foo.add(""key1"", ""hello, world!""); //correct - value is a string.foo.add(""key2"", 37); //correct - value is an int.foo.add(""key3"", true); //correct - value is a boolean.foo.add(""key4"", new foobar()); //compiler error - value is a foobar...my ultimate goal is to provide a library for other developers. this feature should enable them to define ""variables"" during runtime and give them a type...edit://firefox' about:config page has something very close to what i want to achieve"
