"reordering tabpages in blank with a for loop hi guys i'm trying to change the order of tabpages but whatever i do i fail...i have a total of 24 tabpages and what i would like to do is ..keep the first 5 tabpages as it is ( index 0 to 4 will remain same) and move the pages 16 to 23 (index 15 to 22) at index 5 ..so it should look something like this: ..index:..0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23..page number: ..1 2 3 4 5 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 24..to accomplish this task i tried to following code:..for (int i = 23; i &gt;= 16; i--).          {.              tabpage lotabpage;.              lotabpage = this.mycustomtab.tabpages[i];.              this.mycustomtab.tabpages.removeat(i);.              this.mycustomtab.tabpages.insert(5, lotabpage);.          }...but the above code fails, any suggestions?"
