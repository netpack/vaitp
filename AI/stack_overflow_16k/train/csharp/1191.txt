"how can i make a settings page affect multiple forms? i am building a game for a school project. i don't think i can call a function from my settings page on my main page, so how can i make my settings page affect the other forms in my project?..i haven't started coding my form as i'm still designing all of the forms, but i don't think i'll be able to call functions from one form in another form. for example (don't ask why) but as a joke/easter egg i want a button to change the game's text into russian. how can i make it so that when i press a button in one form, it affects all of the others?..i haven't tried anything yet, as i'm still designing...edit: i’m working with visual studio 2015, sorry for leaving that out. this is my first post so don’t crucify me to hard."
