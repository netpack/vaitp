"blank file last modified time i am trying to get the last write time of a particular file. this is the code and it works:`..directoryinfo dr = new directoryinfo(folderpath);  .fileinfo[] fr2 = dr.getfiles(""inputdata.csv"");.var filelastmodified= null;..foreach (fileinfo f1 in fr2).{.    filelastmodified = f1.lastwritetime;.}...filelastmodified gives me the last write time and i am only interested to find the time of this inputdata.csv file. the problem is i do not want to use a for loop and need the write time for just one particular file. is there a better way to write this without the loop?"
