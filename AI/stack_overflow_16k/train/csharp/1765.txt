"blank - creating x and y axis with customizable rectangles i'm working on a school project...the goal is to create x and y axis with numbers, that part i can handle...problem is, i have to create numericupdowns that will allow me to create rectangles on specific x and y axis with specific size. the size and position is to be controlled by the numericupdowns. i could use some help as i do not know any command that could connect the two. ..also if there is a way for the numbers on the axis to repeat itself without me having to write it individualy then i could use that as well...how it should look..        public void tvary(float x, float y, float polomer, graphics gr).        {..        gr.drawellipse(pens.black, x, y, polomer, polomer);.        gr.drawellipse(pens.black, x - 15, y - 15, polomer * 2, polomer * 2);.        gr.drawellipse(pens.black, x - 30, y - 30, polomer * 3, polomer * 3);..        gr.drawrectangle(pens.red, x-30, y-30, polomer * 3, polomer * 3);.        }...right now the x and y position of the rectangles are written in the code itself. i would like to move the rectangles by using the numericupdows that are shown on pic 3..the thing is that i do not know how to do that...unfortunately i cannot post more than 1 picture at the moment."
