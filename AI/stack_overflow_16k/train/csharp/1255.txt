"alternative to imagelist tag i asked this question earlier get image from list view..to which i got a reply of ""use the tag field"". however after spending all morning trying to do this and the tag field always being null i got curious and stumbled across this..http://connect.microsoft.com/visualstudio/feedback/details/115832/imagelist-does-not-preserve-the-tag-property-of-images-added..when creating an imagelist and adding an image that has the ""tag"" property set to a non-null value, the imagelist does not retain the tag value for the image. when retrieving the image at a later time from the imagelist, the tag property of the image is null...now i am pretty stuck, what alternatives are there to using tag?..thank you..foreach file in the pdf collection..add it to the image list..determine other files to add..add to the image list..set listviewimages to imagelist pictures`..now i want to use the item clicked (a listviewitem) and determine how to open it (a pdf does a certain task, a custom icon does something else)..sorry i cant be more precise but i am worried about posting work data/code"
