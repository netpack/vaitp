"is an object creating using an ""inline"" new statement automatically disposed? the following snippet is taken from an example of combobox::drawitem implementation on this msdn page:..e.graphics.fillrectangle(new solidbrush(animalcolor), rectangle);...i question this part:  new solidbrush(animalcolor)..since this is neither deliberately given a dispose nor is it wrapped in a using, i assume this is also an example of poor form, since the solidbrush object will be created and never disposed...i have always labored under the assumption that i must use one of the aforementioned disposal mechanisms directly, or risk a memory leak...am i correct, or is there some deeper implicit disposal going on of which i am unaware? perhaps because it was never assigned to a variable?"
