"printing double values on my system, the following code prints '3.6':..double a = 1.2;.int b = 3;..double c = a * b;..console.writeline(c);...but in the debugger, i can see that c has a value with more than 2 digits:....i know that i can display the full representation with console.writeline(""{0:r}"", c). is this the only and recommended way to display the actual value of a double?....update..going with the above example, i'd like to print c such that if the user were to take the printed value and insert that back into the code in a test using ==, the comparison would be true. in this case c == 3.5999999999999996 returns true."
