"is there a way to change a value of a timespan object? i'm getting new time values in milliseconds regularly and need it in the form like ""00h 00m 00s"", so thinking of using timespan because it's very simple to use...timespan t = timespan.frommilliseconds(timevalue);..but what i'm worrying about now is gc. i don't think it's a good idea to call frommilliseconds() every time because it seems it creates a new instance all the time..i need to update the time value in every 0.1 secs or so, so if there's a way to modify the value of the timespan object directly, it can be very useful for my case. otherwise, i think i need to create a method on my own....is it possible?"
