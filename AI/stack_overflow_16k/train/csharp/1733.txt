"blank - search inside for loop i'm having troubles with my current code and i wish someone help me to develop a simple one or at least give some ideas (pseudocode)...basically i have n drones and i want to create a ""safe area"" around them...so i want to if drone2 is inside drone1's safe area i want stay outside. but i want to create for n drones (drone.length)..for example:.if drone2 approaches drone1 from the +x side i want him to stay in position (x+1,y) so they dont collide..image of the safe area..code:..for each drone i have:.int xmin.int xmax .int ymin .int ymax.string ip (example ""192.168.1.10"".point position (x,y)..for(int i = 0 ; i&lt;drone.length;i++).{..   //i think i need to check drone's ip to know the current drone being iterated.    if(drone[i].position //is inside every drone[except i]’s safe area.              {.                  //debug: which drone’s safe area is drone[i].position inside?.              }.}...can someone help me please? thank you so much"
