"blank file not found in system32 when running in 32 bit i'm trying to run quser and get the resulting string. when i run the code below, i see the following message the the resulting string is empty:...  'quser' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file....process p = new process();.p.startinfo.useshellexecute = false;.p.startinfo.redirectstandardoutput = true;.p.startinfo.filename = ""cmd.exe"";.p.startinfo.arguments = ""/c quser /server:someserver"";.p.start();..string output = p.standardoutput.readtoend();..p.waitforexit();.console.writeline(output);...so the full command that gets run is ..cmd.exe /c quser /ser:someserver...which runs fine when i do it directly, but fails from blank...i found a similar question with no answer here: executing quser windows command in blank; returning result to string. this question doesn't have the quser not recognized message though...why would the command not be recognized when running from code? ..i tried running the quser command directly like so, but i get a file not found... strange..process p = new process();.p.startinfo.useshellexecute = false;.p.startinfo.redirectstandardoutput = true;.p.startinfo.filename = @""c:windowssystem32quser.exe"";.p.startinfo.arguments = @""/server:someserver"";.p.start();..string output = p.standardoutput.readtoend();..p.waitforexit();.console.writeline(output);...we found that running it in 64 bit, it finds it. when running as anycpu or 32bit, it seems to be looking in syswow64, even when i directly tell it to look in system32"
