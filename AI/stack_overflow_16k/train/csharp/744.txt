"replace part of a string with new value i've got a scenario, wherein i need to replace the string literal with new text...for example, if my string is ""01hw128120"", i will first check if the text contains ""01hw"" if yes, then replace that with the string ""machineid-""...so eventually i wanted ""01hw128120"" to be ""machineid-128120"". sometimes i do get the string as ""1001hw128120"" - in this case also i require to replace the ""1001hw"" with ""machineid-"".i tried the below code snippet, but this does not work to my expectation...string sampletext = ""01hw128120"";.if(sampletext.contains(""01hw"")).  sampletext = sampletext.replace(""01hw"",""machineid-"");...any suggestion would be of great help to me."
