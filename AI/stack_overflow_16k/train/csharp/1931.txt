"how to use class as a parameter in static method i have a static method (relevant) inside a class that process xml documents (not so relevant). the method looks like this.....public static bool processformfile(iformfile formfile, modelstatedictionary modelstate, string fileextensiontovalidate = ""docx"").{.    //...some logic &amp; stuff.    memberinfo property = typeof(uploadtemplateviewmodel).getproperty(formfile.name.substring(formfile.name.indexof(""."") + 1));..    //... all the rest.}...as you can see i'm using reflection to get some properties from uploadtemplateviewmodel. the thing is that i need that this class be dynamic using another class such as someotherviewmodel and use it inside the method...i have tried using something like this.....public static bool processformfile(iformfile formfile, modelstatedictionary modelstate, t entity, string fileextensiontovalidate = ""docx"") where t : class...... but i get constraints are not allowed on non-generic declarations. this is a topice that i've always wanted to learn more about but this is the first time that i use it in a real case scenario. ..how can i achieve this? changing method from static to public or something like that? thanks in advance...the method works, and i can get property via reflection, i just need to use typeof(somethinginmethodparameters).getproperty()"
