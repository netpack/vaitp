"possible mistaken empty statement i am new to programming and i have come across an issue called a ""possible mistaken empty statement"" now i have done a lot of research on this topic, and the solution i was given was to remove the semi colon after the if statement, however this only produces more warnings and more errors that i currently do not know the solution to, i would very much appreciate the help, the language i am using is blank...if (checkbox5.checked = true) ;.double value5 = convert.todouble(checkbox4.checked);.value5 = +1;.double result5 = value5;.label2.text = convert.tostring(result5);"
