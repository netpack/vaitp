"how does the algorithm work of determining the enum value? how does the algorithm work of determining the enum value in blank?..main code:..void main().{.    numbers number;.    number = numbers.four;..    console.writeline((int) number);.    console.writeline(number);.    console.writeline(numbers.four);.}.....example 1..enum numbers {.    one,.    two,.    three,.    four = 1,.    five,.    six.}...set the value to 1 for four..as a result of execution it turns out:...  1 four four...if you decompile, you can see the following:..private enum numbers.{.    one = 0,.    two = 1,.    three = 2,.    four = 1,.    five = 2,.    six = 3.}.....example 2..enum numbers {.    one,.    two,.    three,.    four = 2,.    five,.    six. }...set the value to 2 for four..as a result of execution it turns out:...  2 three three...if you decompile, you can see the following:..private enum numbers.{.    one = 0,.    two = 1,.    three = 2,.    four = 2,.    five = 3,.    six = 4.}...why is the last matching value selected in the first example, and the first matching value selected in the second example?"
