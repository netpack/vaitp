"library for traversing object property tree on blank i want to have a method that could traverse an object by property names and get me the value of the property...more specifically as an input i have a string like ""model.child.name"" and i want this method to take an object and get me the value that could be found programatically via: object.model.child.name...i understand that the only way to do this is to use reflection, but i don't want to write this code on my own, because i believe that there are pitfalls. moreover, i think it is more or less usual task. ..is there any well-known implementation of algorithm like that on blank?"
