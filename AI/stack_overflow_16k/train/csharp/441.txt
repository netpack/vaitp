"how to check if file has been generate for current month i am running a windows service which runs every 6 hours and generates files. for some files i want to generate them only once a month. ..var todaysdate = datetime.now.date;.var firstofmonth = new datetime(todaysdate.year, todaysdate.month, 1);.var monthend = firstofmonth.addmonths(1).adddays(-1);.var filegenerated = false;..if (convert.toboolean(firstofmonth)).{.    var filetouploadone = generatefileone(""sproc_name"");.    var filetouploadtwo = generatefiletwo(""sproc_name"");.    filegenerated = true;.}...how can i make sure the file is generate only once a month...updates: once is month means, generate file one time each month, so that when the services runs every x hours, it does not generate the file over and over again."
