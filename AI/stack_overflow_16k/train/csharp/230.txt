"how to run a other codes based on the value of a variable, wait a few minutes, check the variable and run again? i am getting the row count from a database and assigning it to a variable..i need to run or call other classes and methods from the main method of a console app based on the value assigned to the variable from the database...here are the steps:...check the variable, if it is greater than zero.run the code in side the main method conditional statement.the wait for x seconds.check the variable again and if it is still greater than zero, run and wait again..finally, if the variable is equals zero, exit the console....what i do not know is how to repeat the wait and execute...the following code i an example:..static void main(string[] args).{.    int intcheckrowcount = database.dataexists();..    while (intcheckrowcount &gt; 0).    {.        //run code in here.        thread.sleep(20000);.        //run code again.    }..    //exit when variable is zero.}"
