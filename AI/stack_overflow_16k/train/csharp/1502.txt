"sending status message from one class to my main method i have a class with a lengthy foreach loop that may take a minute or even more to run, depending on number of records i am parsing and inserting, updating,etc....so i have one class like this:..public class filemaneger.{..   public bool parsefile().   {.       // ....stuff.       foreach(datarow row in rows).       {.            // stuff.       }.   }.}...and then in my program.cs  main method:..filemanager manager = new filemanager();.console.writeline(""parsing started..."");.manager.parsefile();.console.writeline(""parsing finished."");...so i was thinking maybe in between of those two messages i can show a few more feedback, for example put a counter in that foreach loop and for every 50 rows that passes.print a console message like ""parsing rows 1 to 50 from 6500 rows"", ""parsing rows 51 to 100 from 6500 rows"", etc.....so i think i need to write some sort of event but i am not experienced with events, can someone help with that part?"
