replacing microsoft.visualbasic.compilerservices.designergenerated() i am converting a vb.net project over to blank.  after the conversion i still have some outstanding issues to deal with.  one is the left over designergenerated() attribute....  [microsoft.visualbasic.compilerservices.designergenerated()].  .  internal partial class tags : servicebase {.  .  ......i do not want to just reference the visualbasic assembly to make this code happy.  i don't want any remenence of vb period.  so i don't know how to replace this attribute with an equivilant blank attribute here.  it looks like this designergenerated() is only used in vb.net so not sure how to resolve this and convert it to some blank equivalent.
