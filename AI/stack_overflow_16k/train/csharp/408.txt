"how to copy an eventhandler to another class of the same hierarchy we have a class modelbase that has defined a propertychangedeventhandler propertychanged. then we inherit from this class, and using kind of a decorator pattern, add more functionality to it -- filtering, inserting, etc. we wrap the current object into another one each time we add stuff to it and copy all the properties so we can use them in the next class...public class modelbase&lt;t&gt; : imodel&lt;t&gt; where t : iview, new(). {.   ....   ....   public event propertychangedeventhandler propertychanged;.   protected internal void raisepropertychanged(string propertyname).   {.     if(propertychanged != null).       propertychanged.invoke(this, new propertychangedeventargs(propertyname));.   }. }.. public class viewmodel : modelbase&lt;grid&gt;, iviewmodel. {.  protected internal viewmodel(iewmodel viewmodel).            : base(viewmodel).  {.     // copy all the properties of viewmodel to the ones of this instance.     ....     ...   .     propertychanged = viewmodel.propertychanged;..  }.. }  ...the issue is that when trying copy the propertychanged event handler the compiler throws the error ... can only appear on the left hand side of += or -= operator......is there a way how a can copy propertychanged property to the next decorator isntance?"
