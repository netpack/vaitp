"difference between networktohostorder and hosttonetworkorder? it seems that with any given input both of these functions return the same value...does that mean that my computer is using big-endian (win7)? because i know networkorder is in big-endian so converting between the two should do nothing, then?..i am a bit confused on when i have to use these functions. i am trying to write a simple client-server program and am currently just familiarizing myself with what msdn has to say about the networkstream, ipadress, and tcpclient classes...when would i need to use these functions, if at all? when sending byte arrays to the server and back would i need to call these functions on the individual bytes before sending them off? i'd imagine not.. what about if i prepend the data with a length integer. would i need to call hosttonetworkorder on that?"
