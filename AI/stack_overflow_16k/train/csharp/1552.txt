"iterate through string and count occurrences this is the question:...write a program that reads a string from the console and prints in alphabetical order all letters from the input string and how many times each one of them occurs in the string. ...it seemed interesting and not too complicated at first, but i couldn't solve it...public static void letters().{.        string input;.        console.write(""enter a string:  "");.        input = console.readline();..        var chars = new list&lt;char&gt;();..        //to populate characters with the letters of the input but without repetition.        for(int index = 0; index &lt; input.length; index++).        {.            if(!characters.contains(input[index])).                characters.add(input[index]);.        }..        //to increment the counter corresponding to the character index.        int[] counter = new int[characters.count];...        //now what ?!..    }...my thinking is:..i create a collection to hold the letters of the input string, without any repetition...then i use an int array of the same size such that each int holds the number of times the corresponding letter has occurred in the input string...i not only don't know how to implement this, but i have a feeling its not an ideal solution.to the problem. there's probably a query or a lambda expression that should make this easy.to implement and read...note: the question following this is of the same nature. the difference is that it asks .to replace the repeated letters with a single one ""aaabbbccc"" to ""abc"". ..i will appreciate if the logic is described. i will try to implement it on my own,.just point me to the logic. ..edit: ..this my answer using a dictionary ..public static void letters().{.        string input;.        console.write(""enter a string:  "");.        input = console.readline();..        var dict = new dictionary&lt;char, int&gt;();..        for(int index = 0; index &lt; input.length; index++).        {.            char thekey = input[index]; //just for clarity..            if(!dict.containskey(thekey)).                dict.add(thekey, 1);.            else.                dict[input[index]]++;.        }..        foreach(var key in dict.keys).        {.            console.writeline(""{0}t{1}"", key, dict[key]);.        }"
