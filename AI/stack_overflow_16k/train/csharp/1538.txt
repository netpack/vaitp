"blank syntax :----- ienumerable<person> people = new list<person>(); i understand the first two statements. however, for the third statement,  i couldn't figure out what type of the people is? ienumerable(person) or list(person)? i assume there is a conversion behind the scenes. can someone explain what techniques is used in statement 3? ...ienumerable(person) people = new ienumerable(person)();.list(person) people = new list(person)();.ienumerable(person) people = new list(person)();"
