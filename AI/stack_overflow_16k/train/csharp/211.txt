"string.split() with default(string[]) as delimiter, how does it work? in some blank code i saw default(string[]) is null, but the behavior looks like it is splitting based on whitespace:..string[] x = ""1 2   3"".split(default(string[]), stringsplitoptions.removeemptyentries);.string[] y = ""1,2,  3"".split(default(string[]), stringsplitoptions.removeemptyentries);...here, x becomes string[3] = {""1"",""2"",""3""}, y becomes string[2] = {""1,2,"",""3""}...my input string can be separated using whitespace or comma i.e.""1 2   3"" or ""1,2,  3"". but i want output to be numeric array string i.e. {""1"",""2"",""3""}..how can i achieve this?"
