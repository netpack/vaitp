determine if all the properties in two classes are equal i have method that updates the properties of a class and then updates that object in the database using a web service. i want to verify that the update succeeded by pulling the new object and comparing it to an object in memory. ..do i need to compare each property or will this determine if they have the same values for all the properties?..var areequal = objectthathaschanges.equals(objectsavedtodatabase);
