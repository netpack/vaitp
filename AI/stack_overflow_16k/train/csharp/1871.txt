"environment.currentdirectory in resources i'm trying to put this string in my resources:..environment.currentdirectory + \server files\...but whenever i load the string, the environment.currentdirectory part is shown as normal text instead of the current directory path :(...example:..console.writeline(resources.serverfileslocation); // doesn't give me a path, but just plain text."
