"unable to read xml file with characters at the beginning of the document i am trying to read data from an xml file. the data has characters at the beginning of the document (the document comes this way as i am getting the files from an ftp site) so i am reading as string so that i can pad out the extra characters with code. now when i open the file in notepad++ or word pad it opens just fine, the problems comes when i want to do it from my program...i have tried to use both streamreader and file.readalltext() methods as i always do but nothing seems to work. when i run it from my code all i get is a few special characters..view from notepad++..openfiledialog opendialog = new openfiledialog();.opendialog.showdialog();.var filename = opendialog.filename;.var filestring = file.readalltext(filename);...i have also tried to change the encoding type when  reading from the file but it still doesnt work"
