"one time generic event call? what i am trying to achieve is to create convenient syntax for calling a callback on an event only once...public static class extensions.{.    public static void once&lt;t&gt;(this eventhandler&lt;t&gt; @event, eventhandler&lt;t&gt; callback).    {.        eventhandler&lt;t&gt; cb = null;.        cb = (object that, t info) =&gt; {.            if (callback != null) {.                callback(that, info);.            }.            @event -= cb;.        };.        @event += cb;.    }.}...this should allow us to write something like this:..obj.onsomething.once((sender, obj) =&gt; console.writeline(obj));...note that onsomething is an event eventhandler of some type...the problem is that i get the error message:...  error cs0070: the event sharptox.core.tox.onfriendmessage' can only.  appear on the left hand side of += or -= when used outside of the type.  sharptox.core.tox' (cs0070) (sharptox.tests)...is there no way to achieve this that easily? do i have to remove event from onsomething and make it a simple delegate?"
