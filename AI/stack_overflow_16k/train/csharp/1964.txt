"display each picture in a specific folder in order i have 5 pictures in a folder inside c: ..the pictures are named pic(1) to (5)..i want the program to display the first picture inside that folder then go to the next...i can do it by declaring a string ""path"" and an int ""nextnumb"" and build a code inside a timer where the ""nextnumb"" will increase each time the code runs and change the path from (1) to (2) to (3) and so on.....but this is unefficient i wanted to somehow read/open the pictures inside the folder and display them in the order they are set."
