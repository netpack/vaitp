how to perform search on list of objects using multiple parameters? i have list&lt;&gt; of objects with type of my class car. class car has 12 attributes. and i have 7 textbox where user can enter there search values (some of attributes). how do i search trough this list to get objects which match all data entered?.i've tried something like this:..foreach (car x in cars).{.   //then here i question every attribute with search value which match i add to new list&lt;&gt;.   if(x.color == textbox1.text) search.add(x); .}...textbox1 is one of values user enters. this works when user enters only one value. if i enter two values it finds all objects with any of that two values. but i want to find objects which match both of values.
