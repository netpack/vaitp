"ignore class members based on version? i'm working with an application which change their database models quite often and we have multiple versions of the application installed around in my company at the same time. ..this has made a ""challenge"" for my homemade app, since i am not sure how to handle the models for all the different versions. right now, i have 4 different library dlls including the different models and you have to manually change the dll according to the version you're working with, all compiled with the same name, eg. ""movielib.dll""...is there some sort of attribute i can set or other solutions, so i dont need to have tons of duplicate code?..example..\moviedbapp version 1.0.public class movie .{.    public string title { get; set; }.    public string genre { get; set; }.}..\moviedbapp version 1.1.public class movie .{.    public int movieid{ get; set; }.    public string title { get; set; }.    public string genre { get; set; }.}..\moviedbapp version 1.2.public class movie .{.    public int id{ get; set; }.    public string title { get; set; }.    public string genre { get; set; }.}..\moviedbapp version 1.3.public class movie .{.    public int id{ get; set; }.    public string title { get; set; }.    public string genre { get; set; }.    public datetime releasedate { get; set; }.}"
