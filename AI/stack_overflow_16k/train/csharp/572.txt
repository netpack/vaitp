"checking a checkbox based on a textbox value the code i have here is supposed to load three separate values from three lines in a .txt file. this works fine so far. load1 works well, and gets converted to an integer and then put back into the program as expected.the trouble is load2...what i'm trying to do: i want this bit of code to check whether the text ""counter clockwise"" is the text in load2. if it is, i want it to automatically check a checkbox (rotdir, which is also available for manual input in the main program). the only other available text that can be in that textbox is ""clockwise"", which should leave rotdir unchecked. so ticking a checkbox by using input from a textbox, is this possible?..i figured, this can be solved with a basic true/false kind of statement, since it is only two values. however, this does not seem to work. does anyone have an idea how i could solve this?..streamreader sr = new streamreader(""c:\users\gebruik\desktop\settings.txt"");.string[] lines = sr.readtoend().split(new char[] { 'n' });.load1.text = lines[3];.load2.text = lines[7];.load3.text = lines[10];..int a = int32.parse(load1.text);.servospd.value = a;.label1.text = load1.text;..if (load2.text == ""counter clockwise"").{.    servodir.checked = true;.}.else.{.    servodir.checked = false;.}"
