"inheritance in blank is not working i've started learning blank, but now i'm a little confused, because there i have some problem..i'm trying to do the inheritance of one class to another and it's not working. it says something like ""you have no right parameter"".so, there is the code:..using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;.using system.threading.tasks;..namespace consoleapplication15 // base class.{.    public class cakes.    {.        public int cakes_for;..        public cakes(int number) // constructor.        {.            cakes_for = number;.        }.        public int cakes_get // get value.        {.            get.            {.                return cakes_for;.            }   .            set.            {.                cakes_for = value;.            }.        }.        public static int cakes_plus_number(int n) // number plus constant.        {.            return n + 42;.        }.    }.    }...namespace consoleapplication15 // derived class.{.    public class class2 : cakes // inheritance test.    {.        public int cakeses;.        public int size { get; set; }.    }.}"
