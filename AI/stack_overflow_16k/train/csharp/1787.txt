"how can i sort my list of names alphabetically? i would like to know, how can i sort the names and surenames alphabetically in my list...i'm not sure, but i googled and i'm guessing it only sort's by the name...    public void filterparticipants(list&lt;string&gt; players, playercontainer allplayers).    {.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; allplayers.count; i++).        {.            if (!players.contains(allplayers.findname(i) + "" "" + allplayers.findsurname(i))).            {.                players.add(allplayers.findname(i) + "" "" + allplayers.findsurname(i));.            }.        }.        players.sort();.    }"
