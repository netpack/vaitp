"data updating only with beak point, without changing code. in winform using blank? i have problem in refreshing data in a windows forms application. i have one server (it is also an other client) and one client. my task is to update data in list by clicking on button and server side client is updating properly, but in client it is not updating for the first time. ..but by keeping debug point on particular point it is updating on client side also. i understood that this is happening because of timing issue, so i used thread.sleep();..but still i am facing the same problem..i am not able to understand why this is happening without changing any code."
