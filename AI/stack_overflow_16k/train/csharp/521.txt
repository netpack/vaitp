"blank hide member in same namespace and class it seems like in blank it is not possible to set the timezone for an application, so i want to change datetime.now to my timezone on a machine that runs on utc wich can not be changed..i want to use the system namespace to hide datetime.now because then i can not make the mistake of using the wrong datetime.now because it would be hidden. this is what i want to achieve:..namespace system.{.    public static class datetime.    {.        public new static datetime now =&gt; system.datetime.utcnow.addhours(1);.    }.}...but it does not work becaus of: ...  the type 'datetime in '...datetime.cs' conflicts with the imported.  type 'datetime' in 'system.runtime.'...is there any way to do something like this? ..edit: .i want to know if it is possible to ""override"" system.datetime and if yes, how to do this."
