"blank multiline textbox to .txt file i'm definitely using the wrong method. actually i'm trying to convert from java to blank and it's beginning to become tough ....anyway, i have a textbox1 that is multiline, i write to it by for looping an arraylist...the textbox1 looks like this:..website: https://google.dk.firmanavn: google llc.email: google@gmail.com.cvr: 123456.gscore: 1.glink: googlepagespeedlink...the code that i use right now, which manages to create a file, but it ends up empty. i am surely doing something wrong, and i'm unsure how to write the textbox to the file...private void button3_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        stream mystream;.        savefiledialog savefiledialog1 = new savefiledialog();..        savefiledialog1.filter = ""txt files (*.txt)|"";.        savefiledialog1.filterindex = 2;.        savefiledialog1.restoredirectory = true;...        if (savefiledialog1.showdialog() == dialogresult.ok).        {.            string path = path.getfullpath(savefiledialog1.filename);..            path = dialogresult.tostring();.            if ((mystream = savefiledialog1.openfile()) != null).            { ..                file.writealltext(path, textbox1.text);..                mystream.close();.            }.        }.    }...any help appreciated... :3 :3 i searched for around 1Â½ hours on stackoverflow but i didn't manage to see a sample that would match my way of code :3..i hope it's not a duplicate question, thanks a lot for your answers :)"
