"confused about gridview and inamingcontainer? i have a nested gridview.  in order for me to find the nested gridview, i have to do a findcontrol on the parent gridview, but i was under the impression that you only need to do this if the parent control implements inamingcontainer and according to this link, gridview does not implement from inamingcontainer.  is there another reason?"
