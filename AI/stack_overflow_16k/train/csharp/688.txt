"creating mediatypewithqualityheadervalue throws formatexception i am creating an instance of mediatypewithqualityheadervalue like this:..var m = new mediatypewithqualityheadervalue(""multipart/form-data; boundary=acrcloud***copyright***2015***8d467c7c10a7062"");...it throws a formatexception, so i guess the string that i passed doesn't follow the standard convention. it's supposed to be the content type that my client api requires. i then need to add it to my httpclient to make the api call like so:..var client = new httpclient();.client.defaultrequestheaders.accept.add(m);...my first question is, how can i fix the string that i passed so that the format is correct?..my second question is, is it possible to set the content type to this string, even though it is not formatted correctly?..edit..to clarify, i'm trying to do the equivalent of this:..var request = (httpwebrequest)webrequest.create(url);.request.method = ""post"";.request.contenttype = ""multipart/form-data; boundary=acrcloud***copyright***2015***8d467c7c10a7062"";...but with using the httpclient class instead."
