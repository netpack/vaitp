"using a while loop in blank with a factorial i'm taking a intro to computer programming class at a community college and the instructor wants us to make a while look to display the factorial of the number 7. i wrote the code below as..using system;.namespace theloop.{.    class theloop.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            int number = 7;  .            long factorial = number;.            while (number &gt; 1).                factorial *= --number;.            system.console.writeline(factorial);.            console.readkey();..        }.    }.}...the code works fine. but the instructor wants us to display each step of the loop such as..1.  7 * 6 = 42.2.  42 * 5 = 210.3.  210 * 4 = 840.4.  840 * 3 = 2520.5.  2520 * 2 = 5040..and so on, other than just displaying the result...sorry i'm new to blank can anyone show me how to do that?"
