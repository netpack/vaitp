"set readonly property from collection class it is little hard to explain what i want, but basically, i want to set a readonly property from a collection class. i know it is not that simple...public class listitemcollection : collectionbase {.      // other code..      public void add(listitem item) {.            item.index = list.count;  // want to set index.            list.add(item);.      }.}...i don't want other class from listitemcollection to change the value of that property...public class form1 : form.{.     private void form_load(....) {.          listitem item = new listitem;.          item.index = 5; // i don't want people to set it..     }..}...i know that it is possible somehow because listviewitem manage to do it."
