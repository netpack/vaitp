"getcommandlineargs is not returning what i expected i recently started studying blank through the book and i came to this example where i'm trying to print out arguments passed from the command prompt:..namespace simplecsharpapp.{.    class program.    {.        static void main().        {.            string[] theargs = environment.getcommandlineargs();..            foreach(string arg in theargs).                console.writeline(""arg: {0}"", arg);.        }.    }.}...my command prompt input looks like this:..d:...simplecsharpappbindebug>simplecsharpapp.exe arg1 arg2..and the output looks like this:..arg: simplecsharpapp.exe..arg: arg1..arg: arg2..what i supposed it would look like is:..arg: arg1..arg: arg2..my question is, why does it recognize my execution command as a member of string arguments? what am i supposed to change to get the output i expected?..i could just change foreach loop into for loop starting from the 2nd element like this:..namespace simplecsharpapp.{.    class program.    {.        static void main().        {.            string[] theargs = environment.getcommandlineargs();..            for (int i = 1; i &lt; theargs.length; i++).            {.                console.writeline(""arg: {0}"", theargs[i]);.            }.        }.    }.}...but this does not resolve my curiosity, can i somehow make it not to record executable file like an argument and print it out with foreach loop to get the output i expected?..thanks in advance!"
