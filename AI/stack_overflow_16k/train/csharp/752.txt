"get string dump from file a long time ago, i remember using an utility which dumps all (ascii/utf8) strings from an executable file..i'm now wondering how could i go about implementing this in blank. ..currently, i use an external utility that dumps the strings to a file, and then i read that file from my application. .i'd now like to replace the external utility with some sort of a parser in blank. ..how does the dump strings utility detect utf8 string in a file, and how can i implement this in blank?"
