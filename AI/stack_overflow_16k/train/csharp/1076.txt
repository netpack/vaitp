"editing a blank resource file of a compiled assembly i have a resource file where i am storing connection string etc for a class library (i cant use an app.config, don't ask why)..it was my assumption (might be a stupid one) that i would be able to modify the .rex file out side of the complied assembly at runtime to be able to change connection string through environments without recompiling the assembly each time, can someone verify my assumption and if possible tell me how to do it?..cheers"
