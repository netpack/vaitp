"determine if correct route was taken i'm developing a blank winforms app where i need to determine if a truck took a specifed route, and passed through the points in the correct order.  an example of valid routes would be as follows:..route 1.entry gate 1.scale gate entry side.scale gate exit side.exit gate 1..route 2.entry gate 2.scale gate entry side.scale gate exit side.exit gate 2..the scale gates are the same for both routes, but the entry and exit gates are what i need to worry about.  if a truck enters in through gate 1 and exits through the gate 1, then the route followed was correct.  however, if a truck enters gate 2 and exits through gate 1, then i need to send a notification...each gate has hardware configured as a read point.  when the truck passes the read point a record is created in the database with the timestamp.  i have a timer set up so that at the specified interval it retrieves a list of the valid the truck id's.  it then retrieves the read points that each truck passed within a specified time period and stores those in a list as well.  what i'm not sure of is how to compare the ""correct route"" list with the list of read points that the truck passed.  right now i'm going on the basis that each truck will only make the trip once a day, and will tweak for additional trips after i get this covered...here's my code for the timer..private void tmr_tick(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        int maxtime = int.parse(appsettings.getappsetting(""maxtime""));.        list&lt;string&gt; _assets = new list&lt;string&gt;();.        list&lt;readpoint&gt; _assetreads = new list&lt;readpoint&gt;();..        //get the list of assets to process.        dataset ds = du.executetextcommand(""select distinct assetid from "" + .
