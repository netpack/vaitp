"how do you convert 3 bytes into a 24 bit number in blank? i have an array of bytes that i read from a header section of a message. these bytes contain the length of the message. there never are more than 3 bytes and they are ordered from lsb to msb. so in the example below, 39 is the lsb and 2 is the msb...var data = new byte[] { 39, 213, 2 };...in the example above how can i take those bytes and convert to a number (int,short,etc)?"
