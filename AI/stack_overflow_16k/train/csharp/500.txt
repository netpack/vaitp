"blank -extract substrings from string with change in content (where).  (condition operator=""and"")  .   (expression name=""abc"" attribute=""minor"").   (value)m1(/value).   (/expression)..  (expression name=""abc"" attribute=""id"").  (value)id(/value).  (/expression)..  (expression name=""abc"" attribute=""major"").  (value)m2(/value).  (/expression)..(/condition)     .(/where)...how can i get 3 substrings from the string as maybe minor = the first substring with attribute = ""minor"", then string id= the next substring with attribute id and so on, as the the expression name may change and i cannot use the string as a whole to get the value of id in (value)id(/value). hope my question is clear."
