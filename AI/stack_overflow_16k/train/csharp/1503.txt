"htmltextwriter write new line not working i am building a webpart and i am running into a problem with the htmltextwriter..protected override void rendercontents(htmltextwriter writer).    {.        base.rendercontents(writer);.        foreach (var item in list).            {.                //these i have tried;.                writer.write(string.format(item.text + "" {0}"", environment.newline));.                writer.write(item.text + "" n"");.                writer.write(item.text + "" rn"");.                writer.write(item.text + "" nr"");.            }.    }...i have tried the code above, but what is the problem because it does not make a line break ?"
