"does declaring a class protected automatically make its members protected? if i have a public class and fail to provide an access modifier for one of its members then it is defaulted to private. i was wondering if the default access modifier (private) is always the default regardless of the class' accessibility in which it is contained...for example..public class galaxy : universe.{.    //this is private since no modifier was used.    void createplanet().    {.      //do stuff.    }.}..protected class universe.{.    //access modifier is omitted (private or protected?).    int getgalaxycountwithindistance(galaxy g, int lightyears).    {.        int answer = some logic;.        return answer;.    }.}...can i not do this?..{.    galaxy milkyway = new galaxy();.    int closestgalaxies = milkyway.getgalaxycountwithindistance(milkyway, 100);.}...or would i painstakingly have to declare every single member of my protected class, protected itself?"
