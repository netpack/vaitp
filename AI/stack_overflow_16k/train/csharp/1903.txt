"how do i access an access database protected by a username/password in access workgroups via jet? i found this page which suggested adding the ""jet oledb:system database"" item to my connection string, and then providing a username and password parameter to open. unfortuanately, it seems the .net oledb classes don't seem to have this... i tried the following code just incase:..testconnection = new oledbconnection(""provider=microsoft.jet.oledb.4.0;data source="" + mdbfile + .    "";jet oledb:system database="" + path.getdirectoryname(mdbfile) + ""\system.mdw;"" + .    ""jet oledb:system username=***;jet oledb:system password=***"");...but this just seems to hang for a long time before throwing a ""could not find installable isam"" dbexception...does anyone have any ideas?..edit: i tried using the following connection string, which stopped the exception, but didn't let me access any tables, like what happens when i open access without the workgroup setup properly...""provider=microsoft.jet.oledb.4.0;data source="" + mdbfile +."";jet oledb:system database="" + path.getdirectoryname(mdbfile) + ""\system.mdw;"" +.""user id=***;password=***"";"
