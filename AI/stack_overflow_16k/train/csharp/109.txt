"text writing in blank how can i write down the random variable that was used .for example...string[] fnames = { ""aleisha"", ""sadye"", ""ethyl"");.string[] lname = {""smith"",""johnson"",""melody"");.random r = new random();.int wfname = r.next(fnames.length);.int wlname = r.next(lnames.length);...so if the name ""aleisha"" and ""smith"" is used how can i write that in the text file. ..i already know this code below. but, i need it to use the random one that is picked not another random one. if that makes sense. ..system.io.file.writealllines(@""c:userspublictestfoldernames.txt"", wfnames + wlname);"
