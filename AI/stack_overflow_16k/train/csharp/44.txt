"drive api upload throws error ""invalid credentials"" i am trying to upload large files size more than 1 gb to google drive using drive api(implemented in blank). i created a service account to upload the files. the application working fine for an hour and throwing error ""invalid credentials"" after that. ..i read some other posts from internet which is saying that is is an issue in server side. there is no need to change the client code. ..i have to upload larger files without any issues. how can i overcome this issue?"
