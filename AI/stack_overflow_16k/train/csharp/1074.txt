"sending any file to localhost i want to keep the database files only on the server so when i upload a file i want to send it to ""127.0.0.1""  i tried the following code ..private void sendfile(string filename = ""c:\test.txt"").{.    iphostentry iphost = dns.gethostentry(dns.gethostname());.    ipaddress ipaddr = iphost.addresslist[0];.    ipendpoint ipendpoint = new ipendpoint(ipaddr, 11000);..    socket client = new socket(ipaddr.addressfamily,.            sockettype.stream, protocoltype.tcp);..    client.connect(ipendpoint);..    byte[] filebytes = file.readallbytes(filename);..    client.send(filebytes);..    client.shutdown(socketshutdown.both);.    client.close();.}...but it keep getting me this error : ""no connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it "" which means server is not listening...so, ..1) how fix this in order to be able to send any file to localhost ..2) how i can open files in the browser via ""127.0.0.1[filename].[ext]"""
