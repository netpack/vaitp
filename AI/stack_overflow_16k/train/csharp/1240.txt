"load config file into windows forms i am attempting to build a tool using blank to modify the config files for our software.  the config files are in the following format:..server_name       testserver.server_ip         127.0.0.1.service_number    4.service_id        1 2 3 4  ..and so on.  each line is prefaced with an identifier(ex: server_name), then the value.  i need the tool to load the value for each identifier into a separate text box.  when the user clicks save, it needs to write the updated information to the file...i am entirely lost on how i should load the data into the text boxes, so if you could provide some help on that, i would appreciate it...writing it, i am assuming the easiest way, since all of the data will be loaded, is to erase the previous data, and write the new data to the file.  this i should be able to handle without a problem.  if there is a better way to do this, i am definitely willing to try...i would greatly appreciate some pointers on how to get started with loading the data...private void opentoolstripmenuitem_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        openfd.showdialog();.        openfd.title = ""open a config file..."";.        openfd.initialdirectory = ""c:"";.        openfd.filename = """";.        openfd.filter = ""config|*.cfg"";..        string selected_file = """";.        selected_file = openfd.filename;..        using (streamreader sr = new streamreader(selected_file)).        {.            string currline;.            while ((currline = sr.readline()) != null).            {..            }.        }.    }"
