"format string with decimal i am trying to take a string that may or may not contain a '.' to x amount of characters removing the ""decimal point"" as well.  the result will ultimately be converted to a signed integer. i will also always need to the 1/10 decimal (ie 10 will become 100,  1 will become 10, etc...)  i would like to just format the string without converting to an integer until the very end. ..example..if my incoming string is..9.86.i want 98 as a string ( i don't care about rounding up or anything)..if i get 9.i want 90..if i get -100.i want -1000..if i get -95.353.i want -953"
