"blank losing decimal resolution when i perform a calculation i seem to be losing decimal resolution when i perform the calculation below.  it seems no matter what number i calculate i always end up with some quarter (such as x.00, x.25, x.50, 0r x.75) in the decimal.  thanks for the help.  i know that mph.tostring(""n2"") will trunk it down to 2 decimals, but why into the quarters?..int totalrotations = 0;  .int lastrotations = 0;.int diffrotations = 0;.int hourrotations = 0;.double mph = 0;.double distance = 0;...private void calcmph().{.    uint16 val = counterinputreader.readscanuint16();..    totalrotations = val;.    diffrotations = totalrotations - lastrotations;.    hourrotations = diffrotations * 3600;.    distance = hourrotations * 1.8333333;  //wheel constant, (feet/pulse).  changes per diameter of wheel...    mph = distance / 5280;..    statusbox1.text = statusbox1.text + system.environment.newline + ""load array rotor speed:  "" + mphwind + "" : "" + scan.length;..    sensorscans.add(settings1.default.ch1c, mph);..    //why are we losing the decimal point resolution and only limited to quarters (0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75)?.    lblspeedvalue.text = mph.tostring(""n2"") + "" mph"";..    lastrotations = totalrotations;  //save last rotations per pulse for mph calculations.  ..}"
