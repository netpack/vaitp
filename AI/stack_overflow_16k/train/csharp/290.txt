"trying to create a highest bidder wpf program in blank using visual studio let me start off by explaining my goals first:..i am trying to create the highest bidder program for a single product: a vase. (there is only one product and the product does not change.)..i have 2 inputs name and **offer **, i have a label right below it, which by default states (when no offer has yet been made) ""there currently has been no offer made ""...since the first time a user puts in an offer, he is automatically the highest bidder...the label changes to state the following: ""{name} has with {offer} the highest offer...now here gets the tricky part i have trouble figuring out how to make my program, compare the next's bidders offer to the previous bidder's offer...i want it to state if it's lower: ""sorry {previous bidder} has currently the highest {offer}""..and when its higher the previous bidders offer, the label should change to the current bidders offer to be the highest: ""{name} has with {offer} the highest offer.""..here is an image of the wpf..https://i.stack.imgur.com/mqq21.png..here is the code:.'''..https://ideone.com/e.js/dkvzng..    public partial class mainwindow : window.{.    public mainwindow().    {.        initializecomponent();..    }..    private void butn1_click(object sender, routedeventargs e).    {..        {.            //variabelen .            string name = txtbox1.text;.            string txtbod = txtbox2.text;.            string bodtxt = txtbox1.text;.            int bod = convert.toint32(txtbod);.            int hoogstebieder = 0;..            if (bod &gt; hoogstebieder); .            {.                labeltext.content = $"" {name} heeft met {bod} het hoogste bod."";.                hoogstebieder = bod;..            }..                else.            {.                labeltext.content = ""gelieve een postief getal in te voeren."";.            }....            if (bod &gt; hoogstebieder).            {.                labeltext.content = $"" {name} heeft met {bod} het hoogste bod."";.            }..            else.            {.                labeltext.content = $"" {name} heeft met {bod} het hoogste bod."";.            }.            }.            }..        }.    }...''..here is the xaml: ..'''..https://ideone.com/e.js/aix1m5..'''..i hope i have well stated my question and not made any newbie mistakes...i thank you all in advance."
