"validating a user controls form without validating the form on the page i have a page with two user controls(modal popups in each), each with its own form.  when a user interacts with the form on either user control, i would like the user controls form to validate without causing the page to validate as well.  currently it is causing both forms and the page to validate, which is a huge problem.  how can i cause each item(user controls form and page form) to validate separately?"
