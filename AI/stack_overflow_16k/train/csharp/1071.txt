"generate files and zip without memory stream i'm looking for a way to store files in a zip file without a memory stream. my goal is to save a maximum of system memory, while direct disk io is no problem. .i iterate over a database result set where i have collected some blobs. these are byte-arrays...what i do it the following (system.io.compression):..using (var archive = zipfile.open(""data.zip"", ziparchivemode.update)).    {.    foreach (var result in results).    {.        string filename = $""{result.id}.bin"";..        using (var filestream = new filestream(filename, filemode.create, fileaccess.write)).        {.            // write the blob data from result.value.            filestream.write(result.value, 0, result.value.length);.            filestream.close();.        }.        archive.createentryfromfile(filename, filename);.    }.}...there are 2 problems with this implementation....i have my *.bin files and the one *.zip (only need the zip).i don't know why, but this uses a lot of ram (~100mb for 15x1.5mb bin files)...is there a way to completely bybass the memory?..update: ..what i'm trying to achieve is to generate one zip file that contains single binary files generated from database blobs. this should happen inside a asp.net web api controller. a user can request the data, but instead of sending the whole data in the http response, i generate the zip file in the time of the request, save it to a local file server and send a download link back to the user."
