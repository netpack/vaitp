"save object variables at some point and reuse them exactly as they were saved? let's say i have an object of type player which has health, position and color variables...the game goes through several stages and all variables change during this stages. for example: ...stage1 the player has 80 health, 50.3f position, and green color..stage2 the player has 50 health, 90f position, and blue color....in stage 3 i would like to choose the exact same copy of stage1 or stage2 variables (at random)...one way i could do this is that in each stage i assign these variables to another player object like..stage1playersaved.health = 80;.stage1playersaved.position = 50.3f;.stage1playersaved.color = color.green;...and the same i would do for stage2 and then reuse one of these objects in stage3. but what if i have a lot of variables to save? for example, in addition to those 3 i would have more than 20, 30. the process of saving each variable is ugly...is there any other (easier) approach to save and then reuse the variables i need at certain stages? for example, saving a copy of object at the exact stage and then just reuse its variables later when needed?"
