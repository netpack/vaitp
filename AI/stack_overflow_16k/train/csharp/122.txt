"large file - adding lines - out of memory i have a very large sql insert file which is throwing ""out of memory"" errors when running it in sql enterprise manager...the advice i have seen is to add the ""go"" command every x amount of rows to the inserts are ""batched""...i am trying to write a small function to read the file and every 50 lines add a row with the text ""go""..the code i have written is also throwing system.outofmemoryexception when i run it...can anyone suggest a better way of writing my code to fix this problem please?..this is what i have written:..public static void addgo().    {.        int currentline = 0;..        string filepath = @""c:userstrevo_000desktopfmm89386.sql"";..        var text = new stringbuilder();..        foreach (string s in file.readalllines(filepath)).        {.            // add the current line.            text.appendline(s);..            // increase the line counter.            currentline += 1;..            if (currentline == 50).            {.                text.appendline(""go"");.                currentline = 0;.            }.        }..        using (var file = new streamwriter(file.create(@""c:userstrevo_000desktopfmm89386clean.sql""))).        {.            file.write(text.tostring());.        }..    }"
