"methods are called as thread! are they in a ordered stack? i have this code :..for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++).{.    printvalue(i);.}..private void printvalue(int value).{.    console.writeline(value);.}...is there any case in which the numbers printed are not in order? ..i mean, maybe the thread of the method printvalue(60) is executed before than printvalue(50)? (just as example)...or they are synchronized?"
