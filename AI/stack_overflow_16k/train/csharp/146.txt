"quadratic formula returning an error i'm working on a program, and i'm using the quadratic formula. this is the code that executes when a button is clicked, to solve the problem,..private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.    double aval, bval, cval, xval1, xval2;.    xval1 = 0;.    xval2 = 0;.    aval = convert.todouble(a.text);.    bval = convert.todouble(b.text);.    cval = convert.todouble(c.text);.    xval1 = (bval + math.sqrt(math.pow(bval, 2) - (4 * aval * cval))) / 2 * aval; //positive calculation.    xval2 = (bval - math.sqrt(math.pow(bval, 2) - (4 * aval * cval))) / 2 * aval; //negative calculation.    xpos.text = convert.tostring(xval1);.    xneg.text = convert.tostring(xval2);.}...after some debugging, i believe i've narrowed the issue down to line 9 and 10, where the actual math takes place. however, i'm not quite sure what's wrong. as you can see, the numbers are doubles, and are initialized, so they are not null, or truncating. when i run the program and input a b and c values of say, 6, 4, and 3, the xpos and xneg labels which are responsible for outputting the negative and positive values, simply display nan. should i be using a label for this sort of thing?"
