"using blank language, if(negativevalue < 0) returns 'false' rather 'true' snippet : calculating discriminant (disc) for a quadratic equation :..        disc = math.sqrt((secondcoefficient * secondcoefficient) - (4 * firstcoefficient * thirdcoefficient));.        if (disc &lt; 0).        {.            messagebox.show(""its imaginary discriminant which can't be calculated!"");.        }.        else.        {.            messagebox.show(""the discriminant of the required quadratic equation is : "" + convert.tostring(disc), ""discriminant calculator"");.        }...output :.disc = -ve(negative value).display text : the discriminant of the required quadratic equation is : nan.would you please explain me in detail ? i tried of understanding but failed to get the right reason...question : if disc value is negative then 'if' statement returns as 'false', while it should return as 'true'."
