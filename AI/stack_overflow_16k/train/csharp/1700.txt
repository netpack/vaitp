"why cant i use the {0} when writing in msgbox? if i want to show something in a console i usually write it like this: console.write(""hello{0}"", anynumber);...but if i use interaction.msgbox and write interaction.msgbox(""hello {0}, anynumber""); i am getting an error, why is that? ..i like to use placeholders like {0} a lot more than + (string concatenation) when writing, i think it is easier to write it like that.....so my question is: why can't i use placeholders in msgbox and is there any other way to use them?..here is a example how i would like to use it in msgbox:..static void multiplikation(int tal1, int tal2).{        .    if (tal1*tal2 == 100).    {.          interaction.msgbox(""hello!nresult:n"" + (tal1 * tal2));.    }.    else.    {.          interaction.msgbox(""resultat:n"" + (tal1 * tal2));.    }.}.static void addition(int tal1, int tal2).{.    if (tal1 + tal2 == 100).    {.         console.write(""hello!nresult:{0}n"", (tal1 + tal2));.    }.    else.    {.         console.write(""resultat:{0}n"", (tal1 + tal2));.    }.}"
