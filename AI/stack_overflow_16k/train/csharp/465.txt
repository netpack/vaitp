"blank streamwriter formatting issue i'd like to thank stackoverflow member pratap .r first because he helped me with the code.  i'm still have a small formating issue with one of my replace functions.  what is happening is when i replace &lt;/me&gt; it replaces with ;.  i can't have the end of the row have a ; at the end...using (filestream strm = new filestream(exportfile, filemode.create)).{.    using (streamwriter writer = new streamwriter(strm)).    {.        sqlcommand cmd = new sqlcommand(sql, con);.        sqldatareader reader = cmd.executereader();..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; reader.fieldcount; i++).            writer.write((i == 0 ? """" : ""|"") + reader.getname(i));..        writer.write(""n"");..        while (reader.read()).        {.            for (int i = 0; i &lt; reader.fieldcount; i++).            {.                writer.write.                (.                    (i == 0 ? """" : ""|"") +.                    reader[i].tostring().replace(@""&lt;me&gt; "","""").                        .replace(@""&lt;/me&gt;"", ""|"").replace(@""&lt;/me&gt;"", "";"").                        .replace('n', ' ').replace('r', ' ').                );.            }..            writer.writeline();.        }..        reader.close();.    }.}..so you can see when it occurs with  it's replaced with "";"".  i can't have a ; end the row.  any suggestions or tips always appricated."
