"blank variable seems to go out of scope after function call i have to following function..    public int[] pollalldevices().    {.        /* polling commands */.        const byte poll_front_radar = 0x00;.        const byte poll_rear_radar  = 0x01;.        const byte poll_disp        = 0x02;.        const byte poll_ctrl        = 0x03;.        const byte poll_exp1        = 0x04;.        const byte poll_exp2        = 0x05;..        byte[] buff = new byte[32];.        int[] _ret = new int[32];// { 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 };.        int i = 0;..        if(api.uart_write(devptr, new byte[1] { poll_front_radar }, 0, 1)).        {.            if (api.uart_read(devptr, buff, 0, 1, 1000) != 0) .            {.                _ret[i++] = (int)buff[1];.            }.        }.        if (api.uart_write(devptr, new byte[1] { poll_rear_radar }, 0, 1)).        {.            if (api.uart_read(devptr, buff, 0, 1, 1000) != 0).            {.                _ret[i++] = (int)buff[1];.            }.        }..        return _ret;..    }...i have _ret in the watch window. i can see it exists up until the point i call api.uart_read and then it turns grey in the watch window and i see...  _ret   cannot obtain value of local or argument '_ret' as it is not available at this instruction pointer, possibly because it has been optimized away.    int[]...(just throwing that in there as extra information. it's not my question so i'm not sure why this was marked as a duplicate. all the solutions to that error seem to revolve around optimization and i don't have optimization turned on.)..when i try to write to it i get an array out of bounds exception. i=0 at that point but just for grins i have hardcoded it to _ret[0] and i still get the exception. if i change _ret to an int i can write to it again...i have optimization turned off. can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong here?"
