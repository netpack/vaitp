"is it a good practice not to use returned value of a method? here's my method: ..   public static bool validateaddresscount(ref long o_addresscount).    {.  // o_addresscount is modified here.  //return true or false.   }...i've reached some case when i don't care what the method returns, i just need the o_adresscount.is it a good practice to use this method in the following way:..  long addresscount =  0;.  validateaddresscount(ref addresscount); //without assigning the returned value to any variable.  //use address count...also, can anyone explain why this works in .net?..thank you"
