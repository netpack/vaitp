"modifying methods in helper class recently i came across a question which i was not very sure about. the scenario is :..say we have a helper class : h and a method in helper class m1(int a, int b, int c) accepts three parameters. there are three classes which make use of this method : c1, c2, c3...now, we need another class c4 which also uses method m1 and will pass four parameters instead of three. ..so, how do we tackle this problem...do we need extension methods.?"
