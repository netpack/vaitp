"saving listbox items into a csv file i have a list box which contains student information, it has a studentid and a student mark, when i write to the file i want the studentid and studentmark to be in separate columns (for example the first students id will be in a1 and their mark will be in b1. and so on until all the students have been written into the file)..i have this code, but this code only adds the studentinformation into the one column, how would i go about making it split the data and putting them in 2 columns..if(lstmarks.items.count &gt; 0).            {.                using(textwriter outputfile = new streamwriter(""studentrecords.csv"")).                {.                    foreach(string data in lstmarks.items).                    {.                        outputfile.writeline(data);.                    }.                    messagebox.show(""student information inserted successfully""); .                }.            }"
