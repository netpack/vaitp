blank substring from specific character until first space i want to replace string that start with specific character until first space space after that (or maybe first specific character) with another string...for example if we have a string like this:..aaa bbb ccc @ddd eee fff @ggg hh#iii. jj...i want to make it something like this...aaa bbb ccc @mmm eee fff @mmm hh#mmm. jj...i found a solution but that's not helpful for me...update:..i want to replace all word that start with @ or # and ended with  or . or something else that i want with a string like mmm....  in a real example i only know some work start with @ or #.
