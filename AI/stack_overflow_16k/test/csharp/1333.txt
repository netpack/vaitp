the modulus of a product with a large uint64 integer is incorrect why does the last output line return 51? first line proves that a mod b is zero. i would expect the third line to also be zero because i'm just multiplying the number by the same b...there are no exceptions being thrown. i assume it's an overflow but why? and how to avoid this?..uint64 a = 749243140505953395;.uint64 b = 71;..console.writeline((a % b) == 0);.console.writeline((a*b) &lt; uint64.maxvalue); .console.writeline((a * b) % b);
