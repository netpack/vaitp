"count how many times a specific mathematic equation is wrong, and display at the end basically i've created a times table app. at the end of the app, i've been able to say how many times i got it wrong, and how many times i got it right...however i want it to say:..you got: ..6 x 4 wrong 6 times...5 x 2 wrong 9 times. ..etc.....rather than you got 20 correct, and 8 wrong...so i can see the specific multiplications i got wrong. i know where i need to add the code (under the else statement). but not sure how to go about this...i thought the best solution would be storing all the wrongs as a string in an array, then counting identical strings and outputting a number. but i have no idea how to do this. ..here's my code:..namespace timestablesgame.{.class multiplication.{.    random rng = new random();.    int randomnumber;.    int randomnumbertables;.    int c = 0;.    int w = 0;.    int numberofgos = 0;.    int minrangetables;.    int maxrangetables;.    int minrange;.    int maxrange;...    public multiplication().    {.    start:.        console.clear();.        console.writeline(""nplease enter the lowest number range you would like to practice your times tables on: "");.        minrangetables = int.parse(console.readline());..        console.writeline(""nplease enter the higest number range you would like to practice your times tables on: "");.        maxrangetables = int.parse(console.readline());..        console.writeline(""nplease enter the number of times you would like play: "");.        numberofgos = int.parse(console.readline());..        console.writeline(""nplease enter the minimum range you would like to multiply by: "");.        minrange = int.parse(console.readline());..        console.writeline(""nplease enter the maximum range you would like to multiply by: "");.        maxrange = int.parse(console.readline());..    repeat:.        console.clear();...        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= numberofgos; i++).        {...            randomnumbertables = rng.next(minrangetables, maxrangetables + 1);.            randomnumber = rng.next(minrange, maxrange + 1);....            console.write(""nn{0}: {1} x {2} = "", i, randomnumbertables, randomnumber);..            if (randomnumbertables * randomnumber == int.parse(console.readline())).            {..                console.writeline(""correct"");.                c++;..            }.            else.            {.                console.writeline(""wrong it is: "" + randomnumbertables * randomnumber);..                w++;.            }.        }..        console.writeline(""nyou were correct {0} times, and wrong {1} times."", c, w);..        console.readline();.        console.writeline(""would you like to play again? type y for yes with new settings, r for repeat using last settings, and any other key to exit."");.        char again = console.readkey().keychar;..        if (again == 'y').        {.            c = 0;.            w = 0;.            goto start;.        }.        else if (again == 'r').        {.            c = 0;.            w = 0;.            goto repeat;.        }..    }..}.}"
