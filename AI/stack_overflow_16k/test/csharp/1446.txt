"how to make the console wait but then continue without pressing a key? i'm fairly new to this community however i'm studying at college on an it course. and we have been set an assignment to come up with our very own console code. i thought it would be cool and somewhat unique if i program a funny hacker like typerwiter. i have managed to get it to type by itself and be automated so the user doesn't have to do anything for the program to work...this project is completely experimental and more of a challenge to expand my knowledge and skill however i would like to find out and know how to:..1; make the program wait...so for example where my text reads ""initiating decryption..."" i would like it to wait, let's say 3 seconds and then carry on. to make it seem as if it's actually processing some sort of data...2; make it work on commands...so i have basic knowledge on switches and if commands. however, i'd like to learn more in-depth on how it all works..so say in my last text ""would you like to proceed?"" i wanted a choice to either close down the console or to carry on with the imaginary decryption. how could i achieve this by then being able to carry on making more text and options for the user to participate?..        {.            console.foregroundcolor = consolecolor.green;.            var mystring = ""initiating decryption..."" + environment.newline + ""&gt; 248,604 possible combinations found"" + environment.newline + ""&lt;-&gt; would you like to proceed?"";...            foreach (var character in mystring).            {.                console.write(character);.                thread.sleep(60);.            }.            console.writeline();.            console.readline();.        }.    }"
