"check if multiple dictionaries with the same keys have the same values let's say i have an array of dictionaries. all of the dictionaries have the exact same keys. for each key, i want to return the indices of the dictionaries in the array if they have the same value for that key as at least 1 other dictionary...for example, if there is a key ""a"" and arrayofdictionaries[0][""a""] and arrayofdictionaries[2][""a""] both evaluate to 7, i want to add to an empty dictionary&lt;string, int[]&gt; the pair (""a"", [0, 2]). ..i am very confused with the logic on how to go about accomplishing this."
