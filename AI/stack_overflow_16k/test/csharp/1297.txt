"how to create structure at runtime and convert byte[] pointer to created structure? usually we create structure at design time, create the object and assign the data at runtime. but i would like to create the structure at runtime...i have the structure members and it's types as shown below...name, string.age , int32.hobies[], sring[].height, float.temp[], byte[]...etc.....now by using the above structure members, create the structure at runtime..we  will have the byte array which will contain the data. i should marshal it and convert it into created structure using pointertostructure or something else...thank you in advance."
