"why  winform using external dll(vc) and ocx(vc) control can only import one? we have a .net framework application with a vc dll and a vc ocx, and now if we only import one dll it is ok, but when we import both, it will pop up a messagebox saying: debug assertion failed!..i studied the child module of our application that imports the vc dll, and i found after the framework import vc ocx and initialize, then the function loadlibrary in our module importing the vc dll would return 0, that means memory limited or it's being called improperly...i use getlasterror() the error code is 1114...so i am very frustrated, hope someone can help me."
