"blank slow ui performance when calling begininvoke frequently i have a main form called proxytesterform, which has a child form proxyscraperform.  when proxyscraperform scrapes a new proxy, proxytesterform handles the event by testing the scraped proxy asynchronously, and after testing adds the proxy to a bindinglist which is the datasource of a datagridview...because i am adding to a databound list which was created on the ui thread i am calling begininvoke on the datagridview so the update happens on the appropriate thread...without the begininvoke call in the method i will post below, i can drag the form around on my screen during processing and it doesn't stutter and is smooth.  with the begininvoke call, it's doing the opposite...i have a few ideas on how to fix it, but wanted to hear from smarter people than me here on so so i solve this properly....use a semaphore slim to control the amount of simultaneous updates..add asynchronously processed items to a list outside of the scope of the the method i will post below, and iterate over that list in a timer_tick event handler, calling begininvoke for each item in the list every 1 second, then clearing that list and wash, rinse, repeat until the job is done..give up the convenience of data binding and go virtual mode..anything else someone might suggest here...private void site_proxyscraped(object sender, proxy proxy).{.    task.run(async () =&gt;.    {.        proxy.isvalid = await proxy.testvalidityasync(judges[0]);.        proxiesdatagridview.begininvoke(new action(() =&gt; { proxies.add(proxy); }));.    });.}"
