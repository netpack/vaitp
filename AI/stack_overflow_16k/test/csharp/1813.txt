"keep program from error state when network connection is lost i went to the code review community to look over a snippet i produced. they seemed particularly interested in the method i use to keep the program running if there is a network connection issue with the database. i have posted the link to my question below...link to code review question..my question to you guys is, what is the best practice for keeping a program running while connection to the database is lost?..code in question..private void reestablishdatabaseconnection().        {.            bool broken = true;.            conn.connectionstring = r.getsqlconnstring();..            while (broken).            {.                system.threading.thread.sleep(30000);.                try.                {.                    conn.open();.                    conn.close();.                    broken = false;.                }.                catch (exception){}.            }.        }"
