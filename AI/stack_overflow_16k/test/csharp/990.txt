"converting decimal in excel file into money blank i have created a console application for reading an excel file and creating a new record in microsoft crm. this program works perfectly on my laptop. but when i move the program into our production server, it doesn't read the value like it should. ..this my code:.. selling = row[""column5""].tostring();.. if (!string.isnullorempty(selling)). {.     decimal total_selling = .     convert.todecimal(selling,cultureinfo.invariantculture);.     sales_contract[""new_actualsalesvalue""] = new money(total_selling);. }. else. {.     sales_contract[""new_actualsalesvalue""] = null;. }...example: ..decimal value 7,098.44..when the program runs from my laptop, within crm it shows : $7,098.44..but when the program runs from production server, its shows : $709,844.00..i don't think the problem comes from my code, but something missing in my production server. i know this question may not placed in this forum, but could you tell the solution for this..."
