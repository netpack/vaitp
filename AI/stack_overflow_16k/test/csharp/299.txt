"why is there no string.isnumeric function in blank i am just curious to know why the blank language team has not provided a isnumeric function on the string object?. isnumeric function would have been more proper on a string object that the int32.tryparse function...note: i am asking this question because i have found it difficult to explain this to a beginner and i don't like them cursing blank for this! ..update: please, this question is not about how to implement a isnumeric function."
