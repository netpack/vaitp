"how can i deal with this double.nan i have the a convert.todecimal() which occasionally throws an exception with the message ...  value was either too large or too small for a decimal..., because the call to datacontainer.getvalue(colkeyid, index) returns double.nan...if (convert.todecimal(datacontainer.getvalue(colkeyid, index)) != convert.todecimal(newvaluetoset)).{.    datacontainer.setvalue(colkeyid, index, newvaluetoset);.}...i cannot change the api implementation call of the getvalue()..what would be the best approach to deal with the conversion to decimal of a nan double?"
