"use list<>, array or something else? i'm doing some programming exercises from exercism.io and need some input on how to start on the grade-school assignment...the assignment is to add name and grade and receive name from grade index in the form of list&lt;string&gt;. ..the first tests for the assignments looks like this:..[test].public void new_school_has_an_empty_roster().{.    assert.that(school.roster, has.count.equalto(0));.}...[test].public void adding_a_student_adds_them_to_the_roster_for_the_given_grade().{.    school.add(""aimee"", 2);.    var expected = new list&lt;string&gt; { ""aimee"" };.    assert.that(school.roster[2], is.equalto(expected));.}...i'm not looking for a complete solution but i need some advice on what roster should be. my thought was that roster would be a array of list like this:..public list&lt;string&gt;[] roster = new list&lt;string&gt;[];...the problem with this is that it doesn't pass the first test because i have to assign a length for the array so count will never be 0. .i need a push in the right direction on how to solve this."
