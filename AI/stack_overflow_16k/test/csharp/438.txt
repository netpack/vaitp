"get string data from encoded bytes i have an array of bytes that has come from a barcode reader (connected via a com port) reading an id card. when i convert these, i can read some of the data, for example:...  name, surname, city ...etc, but if some of the data has some characters like 'ë' or 'ç', or some characters that are used in our language [ed: op is in pristina, kosovo], i get '?'. how can i get these characters through decoding?"
