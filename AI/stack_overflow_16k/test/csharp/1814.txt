"setting constants/enums at run-time? this seems like an odd request, i appreciate that, but this is the situation:..i have a program which depends on reading in a handful of files. these files are named like: foo_bar_baz.txt where baz is the name of the project and not known until run-time. however it will not change for the entire execution of the program...i want to have an enumerated list of strings which stores all the filenames. so far i have used a sealed class like so:..public sealed class sqlfile.{.    private readonly string name;.    private readonly string value;..    public static readonly sqlfile crbyauthors = new sqlfile(""changes_cr_by_authors_%project_name%.txt"", ""crbyauthors"");.    public static readonly sqlfile documentcrmetrics = new sqlfile(""changes_document_cr_output_%project_name%.txt"", ""documentcrmetrics"");.    [...]...    private sqlfile(string value, string name).    {.        this.name = name;.        this.value = value;.    }..    public string tostring(string projectname).    {.        return this.value.replace(""%project_name%"", projectname);.    }.}...as you can see this depends on my providing the project name variable every time i want to access the filename, even though that filename is really constant from the very beginning of run-time till the end...is there a more elegant way to handle with this situation?"
