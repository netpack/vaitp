filewatcher on private folder i have a windows service that listens on a folder on a server for newly added files. once a new file is added then the services executes a method to carry out a specific function. i don't want the watched folder to be viewable or editable by users' that log in to the server. i would like for another program to blank .exe to be the only app that is able to view and add files. is it possible to hide a folder away from users but make it available to an application?
