"base and derived classes if i have person class which will handle all common properties..person.cs..public class person.{.   public firstandlastname {get; set;}.   public health health {get; set;}.   public personality personality {get; set;}.}...now i will need player objects and later on different types of players (soccerplayer, bballplayer, etc.) since player is a person can i use this approach..player.cs.public class player:person.{.   public sport sport {get; set;}.}...now i want to implement some sport based player unique properties like: in basketball alley up , or volley shoot in football (soccer). you've got the pic...basketball.cs.public class basketball:player.{.   public int alleyuplevel {get; set;}.}...question: is this proper way of creating base and derived classes, should my basketball player have access to all properties defined in person class ?.thanks"
