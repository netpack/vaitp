"crawling a directory i have this test path:..private static string dcrawler = environment.getfolderpath(environment.specialfolder.desktop) + ""testletters"";...is there a way to say:..foreach (item in dcrawler).{.     if (item.isfile).     {.          // check file info date modified code.     } else.     {.          foreach (fileinfo file in ....     }.}...so far i have only found ways to check a file in a directory.  is the only way to do it by having two separate loops one for files and one for folders?"
