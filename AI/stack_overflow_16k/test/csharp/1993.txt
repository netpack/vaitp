"settings save slow down app i've a list of element with a checkbox. the items are available inside a checkbox, and i save all the checked value inside my settings app, in particular, i've a field called available_countries and i save all the event inside this field...essentially when a item is checked a fire the event associated:..private void availablecountries_checked(object sender, routedeventargs e).{.    var item = sender as checkbox;..    if (item.content.tostring() == ""all"")//first item of the list need to check all.    {.        vm.availablenations.select(c =&gt; { c.ischecked = true; return c; }).tolist(); //execute the ischecked update through linq.    }..    //check if the checked value is already added in the settings...    var nationsarr = properties.settings.default.available_countries.split(';');..    foreach (var country in nationsarr).    {.        if (country == item.content.tostring()) //nation already added!.        {.           return;.        }.    }..    properties.settings.default.available_countries += item.content.tostring() + "";""; //separator.   properties.settings.default.save();.}...now this code working well and is very simple, but i noticed that .save() at the end slow down the app performance, infact when i click on the first item of the combobox that have as .content : all i need to change all the ischecked property of all element...i need also to check if the value is already added in the settings...i noticed that if i remove the last line of code i doesn't see the delay time, about 1/2 seconds...there is a way to improve it?"
