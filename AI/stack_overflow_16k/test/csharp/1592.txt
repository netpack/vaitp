"binomial coefficient in blank hi i need to find an algorithm to compute the binomial coefficient. .https://imgur.com/a/ngcw4n7.n is 3, while k must go from 0 to 3. ..i found this link with the code which explains how to calculate the binomial coefficient http://csharphelper.com/blog/2014/08/calculate-the-binomial-coefficient-n-choose-k-efficiently-in-c/ but i don't know how to do when k is not assigned. ..this is the code i found:..decimal result = 1;.for (int i = 1; i &lt;= k; i++).{.    result *= n - (k - i);.    result /= i;.}.return result;"
