"powers in string in blank i wrote a simple programme in blank that calculate the power of a number when you give a x and y (x^y). the answer is showed in a textbox. for example : x=2 and y=5 the answer in the textbox is:..2 x 2 = 32.2 x 2 = 32.2 x 2 = 32.2 x 2 = 32.2 x 2 = 32.2 x 2 = 32...my question is how can i do to have this result: ..2 x 2 = 2.2 x 2 x 2 = 8.2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 .2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32...here is my code:..private void button1_click (object sender, eventargs e).{.    double number1;.    double number2;.    int count = 0;..    double power;.    number1 = double.parse(txtnumber1.text};.    number2 = double.parse(txtnumber2.text};..    while (count &lt; number2).    {.        power = math.pow(number1, number2);.        txtanswer.text = txtanswer.text + number1.tostring() + "" "" + "" x"" + "" "" + number1.tostring() + "" "" + ""="" + power.tostring() + ""rn"";.        count += 1;.    }.}...number1 is x...number2 is y"
