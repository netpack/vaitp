"static methods vs instance methods in bll was asked today why i used code like this for my bll classes in an asp.net app:..public class studentbll.{.    public static datatable getstudents().    {.        return dbhelper.executesp(""getstudents"");.    }.    public static datatable getstudentbyid(int studentid) .    {.        return dbhelper.executesp(""getstudentbyid"", studentid);.    }.}...instead of..public class studentbll.{.    public datatable getstudents().    {.        return dbhelper.executesp(""getstudents"");.    }.    public datatable getstudentbyid(int studentid) .    {.        return dbhelper.executesp(""getstudentbyid"", studentid);.    }.}...only thing i could think of was that..a) performance a slight increase (not sure of the specifics)..b) readability. studentbll.getstudents(); rather than ..studentbll studentbll = new studentbll();.studentbll.getstudents();...i wasn't too confident in those answers, however.  anyone care to enlighten me?"
