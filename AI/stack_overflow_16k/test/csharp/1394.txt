"share fields with derived class i have an abstract class in blank:..public abstract class dataseed {..  private context _context;..  private ireadonlylist&lt;string&gt; _languages = new list&lt;string&gt; { ""en"", ""fr"" };..  private const string drive = ""http://mydriveurl"";..}...what would be the best way to share these 3 fields only with derived classes:..public mydataseed : dataseed {.}...should i use protected, protected and turn them into properties, etc? ..note that:...drive is a constant and cannot be changed;._context should be initialized in the derived class constructor and should not be initialize again after it.._languages is a list that cannot be changed."
