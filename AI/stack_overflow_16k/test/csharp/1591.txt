"conversion of float value to 24 bit i have a float value of 128.523 which needs to be expressed as 24 bit 2s complement signed number...the 23rd bit is the sign bit..bits 22 to fifteen are the integer part..bits 14 to 0 are the floating part...i need to send this data to a protocol which only accepts data in this format...i understand that i need to give my code and ask answers but unfortunately i am totally lost as how to proceed forward...any help would be greatly appreciated...update with the help of the community ...i would be getting tracking data from a external device and send it to a application which uses freed protocol.i have.there is no 24bit float that is the problem , i have found out how the bits would be arranged if we make it 24 bit( user class)..i will send it via udp.i have no idea in what order the bits need to be sent...update..it is bigendian"
