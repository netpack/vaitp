"create array of class objects with independent data i have a class object that has a constructor containing input parameters relevant to a product. once instantiated it's member variables contain result data...for example:..int parm1 = 1;.int parm2 = 2;..myclass myclass = new myclass(parm1, parm2);...the myclass class makes parm1 and parm2 available as public members...so now i need to create copies of the myclass object, like:..myclass myclass1 = myclass;.myclass myclass2 = myclass;...but setting a member in any instance of these classes sets the value in all 3 copies. for example:..myclass1.parm1 = 10;...sets myclass.parm1, myclass1.parm1 and myclass2.parm1 all to 10...i need to be able to do the following:..myclass.parm1 = 3;.myclass1.parm1 = 45;.myclass2.parm1 = 5499;...with none of these effecting the others' settings...how do i create a copy of the initial class object that allows changing public member values without changing those in the original/other copies?"
