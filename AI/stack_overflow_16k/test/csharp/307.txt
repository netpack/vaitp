"how to write a console application that calculates the sum of a given number of integers write a console application that calculates the sum of a given number of integers..the numbers are entered one per line, and the application will read one by one until the user writes the character instead of a number. when the user has typed x, the application knows that all the numbers in the string have been entered and displays their amount...if the first thing the user enters is the x character, the application will return 0...example:..for input:..2.5.-3.1.x...the console will display:..5...and this is my code..string[] answer = new string[10];.int sum = 0..for (int i = 0; i &lt; answer.length; i++).{.    sum += int32.parse(answer[i]);..    if (answer[i] == ""x"").    {.        console.writeline(sum);.    }..    answer[i] = console.readline();.}..console.read();...can anyone tell me why is not working?"
