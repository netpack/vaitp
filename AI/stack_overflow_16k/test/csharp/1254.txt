"is there a core blank rectangle class that's not read-only where it shouldn't? the point has x and y and they can be changed. but the rectangle has the left, top, right, bottom read-only. and to make things even more entertaining, the width and height are writable. so to move a rectangle, you need to offset and change width and height when you could just change the tlrb values accordingly...is there any real rectangle class i'm missing that has these values writable so i don't have to get creative when updating internal values? like rect?..ps: currently using rectangle.fromltrb but i'm typing way more than i should to just change the top value."
