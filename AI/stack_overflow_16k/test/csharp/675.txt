"how to ""send"" a method to inside another method? i have the following:..public class mail {.  public string obfuscate(string email) {.    return email.replace(""@"", ""at"").replace(""."", ""dot"");.  }.}...i am calling the method obfuscate in a class, as follows:..public class resolver {.  public data getdata () {.    return new data { email = new mail().obfuscate(myemail) };.  }.  public string translate(string value) { /* some code */ }.}...the problem is that obfuscate does the replacement in english: @ > at, . > dot..but in the resolver class the method translate does exactly what i need .....how can i ""pass"" the translate method to the obfuscate method so this one uses it to translate @ and . to at and dot in the current language?..so the code line inside obfuscate:..return email.replace(""@"", ""at"").replace(""."", ""dot"");...would be become:..return email.replace(""@"", translate(""@"")).replace(""."", translate("".""));...where translate would be the method that i am ""passing"" to it...than you,.miguel"
