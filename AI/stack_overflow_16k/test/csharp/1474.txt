"load and execute external program (many times) i need to execute external program with arguments and get result from it (~1000 times with different arguments)..i found solution like this:..using system.diagnostics;.....process process = new process();.// configure the process using the startinfo properties..process.startinfo.filename = ""process.exe"";.process.startinfo.arguments = ""qwe 123"";.process.start();.process.waitforexit();// waits here for the process to exit..// and check exit code for result...i need many repetitions with different arguments, but this code every time initiate new process. it is very expensive operation. i think, i can ""load"" (""save"") process and repeat it without everytime initiating..or maybe exist other way to solve this problem?"
