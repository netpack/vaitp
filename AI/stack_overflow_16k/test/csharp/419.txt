"how to remove additional comma in text file casing data to mismatch or overflow to other columns i have a text file that i would like to convert to csv. when i examine the file in excel import wizard the columns and rows looks like the below image:....when i read the file and write to file as .csv then it ends up like the below image, as displayed in the highlighted rows.....i noticed that some of the data in the file has multiple comma' which are the rows data that are running out of their place. this is beyond me...i am using the following code:..class program.{.static void addcomma(string s, textwriter writer).{.    foreach (string line in s.replace("""""", """").split('n')).    {.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; line.length; i++).        {.            if (i &gt; 0).            writer.write(line[i]);.        }.        writer.writeline();.    }.}...static void main(string[] args).{.    textreader reader = new streamreader(@""c:foldersample.txt"");.    string a = reader.readtoend();.    reader.close();..    filestream afile = new filestream(@""c:foldersample.csv"", filemode.create);.    addcomma(a, new streamwriter(afile));.    afile.close();...}.}...found solution update:..all i did was modified the following line of code:.i removed the replace() method...from this: foreach (string line in s.replace("""""", """").split('n'))..to this: foreach (string line in s.split('n'))..also the array starts from zero so i changed the starting point of the counter or int:.meaning instead of this: ..for (int i = 0; i &lt; line.length; i++)...i have this:..            for (int i = -1; i &lt; line.length; i++).            {.                if (i &gt; -1).                writer.write(line[i]);.            }...this ensure that i will also get the first column in the file beginning at zero...thanks everyone."
