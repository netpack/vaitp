"how to check whether the content(string) of a node is in title case? i want to check whether the contents of a node in a xml file is in title case or not. i'm aware that there is a textinfo.totitlecase method which converts any string to title case but is there anything like textinfo.istitlecase which basically checks the string, whether it is in title case or not?..for example, i have some xml files each having the node &lt;title&gt; in one of the below formats(or maybe some other formats, you get the idea)..&lt;title&gt;confer&lt;title&gt;.&lt;title&gt;confer&lt;title&gt;.&lt;title&gt;confer&lt;title&gt;.&lt;title&gt;confer&lt;title&gt;.&lt;title&gt;confer&lt;title&gt;...the program should should check the nodes &lt;title&gt;'s content and if it is not in title case, as it is for all the above examples except the first one it should write a message saying something like ""file: xyz..xml ==> line 100: &lt;title&gt;confer&lt;title&gt; should be in title case""..how can i do this efficiently?"
