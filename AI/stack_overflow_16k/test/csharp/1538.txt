"blank overriding method and returning different objects i have a virtual method on a base class.  each time i override it, i want to return different object types.  i know this is not possible, but what would be the best way to handle this situation?..example of base method:..public virtual void clickcontinue() .{.    //click the continue button.}...and the method that overrides it:..public override myobject clickcontinue().{.    //click then continue button.    //return myobject.}...i need to do several similar overrides, all returning different objects.  again, i know this can't be done the way it's done above - i trying to figure out the best way to handle this situation."
