"setting object properties with or without the blank 'new' keyword is there a fundamental difference in setting object properties with or without the new keyword?..the following is an example to illustrate what i am referring to, shown under case 1 and case 2. wherever possible intend to use case 2 (looks neat as a single statement) but couldn't be sure if the blank new keyword has any downsides such as increased memory usage. @dennis_e i've already voted +1 ;-)..amended supplement:.thank you all with prompt comments and answer. you know comments and answers jog related points which you never thought of when the question was posed. forgive me for amending but hope you understand...suppose the code in case 1 and case 2 are used numerous times (say as you navigate into a view page) does case 2 have a disadvantage in increasing memory. perhaps i am making a wrong assumption here -- does 'new'ing up the same variable create a new object?? may be this is the fundamental question...    public static class mycache.    {.        public static nameidobject mycacheobject = new nameidobject();.    }..    public class nameidobject.    {.        public string name { get; set; }.        public int id { get; set; }.    }..    // usage 1: without new keyword..    mycache.mycacheobject.name = ""foo"";.    mycache.mycacheobject.id = 123;..    // usage 2: with new keyword..    mycache.mycacheobject = new nameidobject { id = 123, name = ""foo"" };"
