"blank is there a way to create functions that accept anonymous function code as argument? i would like to do something like..nameofthemethod(parameters){.  // code....}...there's using, foreach, for, etc. that are already built-in, but i don't know if creating something similar is even possible. is it?..the reason why i ask this is because sometimes that there are many different pieces of code that are wrapped by basically the same code (examples are opening a connection to the database, creating the command, settings the datareader, testing if an element exists in cache and, if not, go get it, otherwise get it from cache, etc.)"
