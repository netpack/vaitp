"tab separated string split in blank there are several stackoverflow question posted but none of them works for me...i have a string say..   string str = ""15.24t7.28t6.04t5.0"";...in app.config, i define a key value..   &lt;add key=""delimiter"" value=""t""/&gt;...in the program, i have something like this.. string delimiter = configurationmanager.appsettings[""delimiter""]; . string[] parsedvalues = str.split(delimiter.tochararray());...while debugging i find that delimiter gets changed to ""t"" and so it doesn't split the string...i have tried changing app.config to .. &lt;add key=""delimiter"" value=@""t""/&gt; ...but this gives an error...even the following gives error... &lt;add key=""delimiter"" value='t' /&gt;...any help greatly appreciated."
