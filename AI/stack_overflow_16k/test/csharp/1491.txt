"""how to fix"" logic in blank factorial calculation's i need to write a factorisation calculator with recursion, for the purpose of learning nlog and how to build custom exceptions. ..i have tried a few different implementations in visual studio 2019 ce with ""if"" and ""for"" loops but i don't really know what i'm doing. ..   public static int factorial(int input).        {...            try.                {.                // create a count for step of recursion..                int factorcount = 0;.                int sqrt = (int)math.ceiling(math.sqrt(input));..              for (int step=1; step&lt;=sqrt;step++).                {.                    if(input % step == 0) {..                        //incress the current step of recursion by one .                        factorcount++;.                        console.writeline(""calculator.factorial:calculating"",step);..                    }.                        console.writeline(input);.              }...the current code is throwing up a. ""process is terminated due to stackoverflowexception."" and that it is getting till at lest ""console.writeline(""calculator.factorial:calculating"",step); "".before crashing."
