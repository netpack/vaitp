"using class/object between two forms i defined a class in form1 as..    public class conditions.    {.        public string name { get; set; }.        public int probability { get; set; }.        public datetime start_time { get; set; }.        public datetime end_time { get; set; }.        public int age_min { get; set; }.        public int age_max { get; set; }.        public bool meldpeld { get; set; }.        public bool onea { get; set; }.        public bool oneb { get; set; }.        public int gender { get; set; }  // 0 - both, 1 - male, 2 - female.        public int meld_min { get; set; }.        public int meld_max { get; set; }..    }...and i'm making a new list like..    list&lt;conditions&gt; newconditions = new list&lt;conditions&gt;();...then, i'm calling form2 with..        conditions newconds = new conditions();.        form2 form2 = new form2(newconds);.        form2.show();.        form2.topmost = true;...in form2, i have..    public form2(form1.conditions newcond).    {.        initializecomponent();.        combobox1.selectedindex = 2;.    }...and i can use set things for newcond in there..what i would like to do, however, is set things in another function in form2 called..    private void button2_click(object sender, eventargs e)...and i can't figure out how to use the newcond in that function. i must be missing something obvious, right?..also, is this a good way to go? basically what i want to do is have the user define any number of conditions (that they can add, edit, delete) and then use those conditions when they run the program. ..thanks"
