"functions with <>s and listing partial classes under a single file? what are functions with &lt;> called? i mean, i usually see them in defining lists like list&lt;> sortedlist&lt;> etc. and they get value types into their parameters (as i've seen). (list&lt;bool&gt; etc.). could i create a class that gets value types as parameters like that? ..customclass&lt;bool, int&gt;(32, ""asd"") test;...other question:.could i list seperated but partial classes under a single file (like form's form.designer.cs and form.resx)"
