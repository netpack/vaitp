"why the need to use ""this"" (some tut) just following some tutorial(http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/hiding_and_showing_forms_in_c_sharp).which says:..as mentioned in the previous section, in order to remove a form both from the display, and from memory, it is necessary to close rather than hide it. in visual studio double click, once again, the button in subform to view the click event procedure. once again, because the button is in the form we are closing we need to use this instead of subform when calling the close() method:..  private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).  {.            this.close();.  }...i still don't get reason why to use this.close() here, as opposed to just close()?..(smth similar is being said about hide() method, one section above)."
