"blank: delete lines before and after specific line i am trying to create a program in which i can delete part and keep rest. below is my example..for instance, if have more than 1000 lines of code containing (connectionstrings)..&lt;add name=""sales"" providername=""system.data.sqlclient"" connectionstring= ""server=myserver;database=products;uid=salesuser;pwd=sellmoreproducts"" /&gt;.&lt;add name=""northwind"" providername=""system.data.sqlclient"" connectionstring=""server=.;database=northwind;integrated security=sspi"" /&gt;...what i would like is to program is to have only names, so from the example i would get an output having ..sales.northwind ...and so on in a seperate file...can anyone help me how can i create a program for this...please let me know if this is an irrelevent post rather than degrading this post...this program will just delete a word but not couple of words or lines before and after sales or northwind..string line = null;.string line_to_delete = ""providername"";..   using (streamreader reader = new streamreader(""source path location"")).   {.       using (streamwriter writer = new streamwriter(""destination path location"")).         {.            while ((line = reader.readline()) != null).            {.              if (string.compare(line, line_to_delete) == 0).              continue;.              writer.writeline(line);.            }.         }.   }...i would really appreciate that."
