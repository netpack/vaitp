implement async pattern over native call i would like to wrap the win32 dns api dnsqueryex function so that it can be used via the .net tpl. i cannot use the managed methods in the system.net.dns namespace because they do not implement cname record lookup...the only way that comes to mind is to poll the outcome of this operation periodically with non-blocking waits between polls using:..await task.delay(n)...the solution above seems inefficient. is there a better way to accomplish this?
