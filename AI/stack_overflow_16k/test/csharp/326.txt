adding list to a new list take if from the top. have a list that i return mytablelist...var mytablelist = list&lt;exportdto&gt;(list);...this tablelist returns id's that is needed to select another level from the same table...ienumerable&lt;int?&gt; rowselect = mytablelist.where(n =&gt; n.id != null).                                         .select(n =&gt; n.id);...this provides me with a list of id's are then returned;.i use a ..foreach (var item in rowselect).    getnewlist = getnewinfo.getsinglerows(item.value);...the main problem is for me adding this new list and merging it with mytablelist.
