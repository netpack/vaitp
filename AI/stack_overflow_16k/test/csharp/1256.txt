"how to get the ""owner"" (not the parent) of a class when it is aggregated as member of another class aggregation is prefered to inheritance. in inheritance can know the parent. in aggregation how can one know the owner in blank ?..if i add an explicit reference to the parent that's evil since i would create a dependency in the other way whereas the compiler knows the parent for sure. is there any way to hack using reflection or something else except creating this reference...how visual studio can build the call stack if the owner wasn't known? visual studio knows all the links that wire instances so there should be a way to do what visual studio does ?"
