"why can't you use 'this' in member initializers? .  possible duplicate:.  cannot use ‘this’ in member initializer?  .....any ideas why i get an error if i try to do something like this:..public class bar.{.    public bar(foo foo).    {.    }.}..public class foo.{.    private bar _bar = new bar(this);.}...i get an error saying:..""cannot use 'this' in member initializer""..but the following works:..public class foo.{.    private bar _bar;..    public foo().    {.        _bar = new bar(this);.    }.}...anyone know the reason behind this? my understanding was that these would compile to the same il, so am curious as to why one is allowed and the other isn't...thanks,.alex"
