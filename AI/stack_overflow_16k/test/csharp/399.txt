"best way to avoid errors due to settings/configuration before runtime a common problem is that programs may compile ok, but external (user/environment) settings may cause applications to crash during runtime...aside from performing checks all over the code, (alas actually performed during runtime), .i would like to have rule sets to assert during build that, at least default values settings, are coherent...the simplest case may be, if default settings are hardcoded  : ..directory defaultdir = new directory(""d:\data"");.userlogin usr1 = ""jesse"";.userlogin usr2 = ""james"";...(yeah, ""booh""; this is an example, please do not comment/answer on that unsignificant detail... i know it's hard for some of you, but please refrain ! :-) )..so, is there a simple way to check during build, that ""d:data"" exists, and that usr1 and usr2 do have different login strings etc.....i am sure there are assertion mechanisms in .net, and maybe unit testing (i'd rather avoid the latter cause it may be oversized for the very light usage/need in this particular case. but i guess that's what unit tests are designed for too...)"
