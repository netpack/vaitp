"how should an abstract class be written to override method with additional parameters i am wondering how i should have written the following code?.i wanted to have a base class, and have one of the derived classes override one of the methods in the base class. but i need a different signature for the method that is to be overridden (to complicate things more, that method is buried in a loop). ..how should i have properly structured the following code to accomplish the equivalent of overriding a method with a different signature? .(getting rid of the abstract declaration is ok to do)..abstract class classbase.{.    public void loopthroughstuff(int i).    {.        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++).        {.            //do a bunch of stuff.            var k = (something determined in loop) //this is used in class2's dosomething(i,k)..            dosomething(i); //this needs to be overridden in class2 with additional parameter, which i know can't be done..            //do a bunch of stuff.        }.    }..    public virtual void dosomething1(int x).    {.        //do stuff.    }.}..public class class1 : classbase.{..}..public class class2 : classbase.{.    public override void dosomething1(int j, int k) //i know this can not be done.    {.        //do stuff.    }.}"
