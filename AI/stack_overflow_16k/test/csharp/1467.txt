"writing contents of a class to a file i have a class, all string properties like this:..public class myclass .{.  public string name {get;set;}.  public string phone {get;set;}.  // a bunch of more fields.....{...and a list of that class list&lt;myclass&gt;  mylistofobjects;   that i have populated it through out the program with values...and then i have a file (csv)  with headers:..name, phone, etc......i want to write the contents of that mylistofobjects into that file..i was thinking just loop through them and write one row per object. but wanted to see is there a better nicer way?"
