"set a chart control's x axis to a 10 minute timeline i am using a line chart to display motion detection levels on a video...i need to get the x axis to display a timeline. for example, if the media player control returns 600 seconds as the length of video, then the x axis should display from 00:00 to 10:00 along the buttom, with perhaps 10 intervals in total. ..so far, i have got this:..chart1.series[0].xvaluetype = chartvaluetype.time;...which isn't much.  i have searched online but the examples that i have found seem to be aimed at a real life date range,and not a simple, 0 to 10 minute range. ..how can i get a simple 10 minute time line for the x axis?"
