"blank code to handle different classes with same method names let's say you have two different blank classes a and b that while not deriving from the same base class do share some of the same names for methods. for example, both classes have a connect and a disconnect method, as well as several others. i want to be able to write code once that will work with both types. ..here is a simplified example of what i would like to do:..public void make_connection(object x).{.  x.connect() ;.  // do some more stuff....  x.disconnect() ;.  return ;.}...of course, this does not compile as the object class does not have a connect or disconnect method. ..is there a way to do this?..update. i should have made this clear from the start: i only have the dlls for a and b and not the source."
