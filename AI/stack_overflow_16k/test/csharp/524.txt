"""could not find a part of the path,"" on path that does exist i am attempting to update the lock screen background like this:.. string filename = @""c:appscreenshot.temp.jpg"";. string finallocation = @""c:windowssystem32oobeinfobackgroundsbackgrounddefault.jpg"";. file.move(filename, finallocation);...unfortunately this throws a system.io.directorynotfoundexception exception: .. an unhandled exception of type 'system.io.directorynotfoundexception' occurred in mscorlib.dll. additional information: could not find a part of the path....however when i browse to c:windowssystem32oobeinfobackgrounds in windows explorer, cmd, or powershell it does exist. i also have the security to write, rename, and delete files in that location (and the blank process is running in my context). what is going on?"
