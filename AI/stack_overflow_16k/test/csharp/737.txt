"how to get the percentage of width with respect to cursor position working with zoom and i found it necessary to set the scroll bar position based on width with respect to the cursor position. how would i be able to accomplish this?..for example if the cursor is at position 300 x-axis for the control and the control is 600 in width, how would i be able to automatically translate this into percentage to use on panel scroll bars?"
