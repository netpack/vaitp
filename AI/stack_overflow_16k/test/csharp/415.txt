how to structure code to run the same service for multiple objects? i have a number of instances of the following object:..public class brief{.   public int id {get; set;}.   public datetime startdate {get; set;}.   public datetime enddate {get; set;}.} ...i want to run the same console service for all these instances. the service essentially uses the id property and the dates property to search in a database and return the related records for that particular bried id...my question is what is the best approach to structure my code...should i create a single class with a list and do a foreach on that list and run the appropriate method or should i create a different instance for each of the objects and then run the services.
