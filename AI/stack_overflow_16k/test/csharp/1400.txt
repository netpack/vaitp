"how to store a very small number i have a formula to calculate weights of some numbers in blank. i have 9 weights. the sum of these weights is 1, so these are too small. .for instance after calculating these weights, the result is something like below:..1/17, 1/17, 1/17, 1/17, 1/17, 1/17, 1/17, 1/17, 9/17..when i want to store these weights in a parameter with double type, the stored values will be:..0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0..the problem is that i need the exact value of these weights to use in another formula, and they are too important in that formula. the sum of them should be 1...what can i do for solving this problem?"
