"writing bytes to a file in blank i have a blob from an oracle database. in .net it is of type oraclelob and has among them a read and readbyte methods...int oraclelob.read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count).int oraclelob.readbyte()...so the read method reads a sequence of bytes and readbyte reads a single byte at a time. here is my code:..oraclelob ol = (oraclelob) cmd.parameters[1].value; //her er filen!!..binarywriter binwriter = new binarywriter(file.open(@""d:wordfile.docx"", filemode.create));.int currentbyte = ol.readbyte();..while (currentbyte != -1).{.   binwriter.write(currentbyte);.   currentbyte = ol.readbyte();.}..binwriter.close();...but when i open wordfile.docx in word, it says that the file is corrupt and cannot be opened. what am i doing wrong?"
