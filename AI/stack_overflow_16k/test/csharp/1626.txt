"readability of very long complex type parameter with lambda expression? the following function uses a very long and complex type long_complex_type and it's hard to read. i tried to add parameter to the function but it doesn't work and var doesn't support lambda expression. what's the best way to make the code more readable besides using-alias-directive? (i don't want to create many type aliases, ideally the type can be inferred)..private void myfunction().{.    func&lt;long_complex_type&gt; dowork = () =&gt; _service.getsomething(.....);.    action&lt;long_complex_type&gt; then = (long_complex_type l) =&gt; { _view.dosomething(l); };.    ....... .}"
