"changing a received file location in blank socket i have created a tcp server in blank which receives a file from a client and keeps it in the current directory. the code segment which does this is as follows:..       using (filestream fstream = new filestream(path.getfilename(cmdfilename), filemode.create)).            {.                fstream.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);.                fstream.flush();.                fstream.close();.            }..        console.writeline(""file received and saved in "" + environment.currentdirectory);...where cmdfilename is the received filename...now i have created a folder named ""test"" inside the current directory using the following code:..            string root = environment.currentdirectory;.            string folder = path.combine(root,""test"");.            if (!directory.exists(folder)) directory.createdirectory(folder);...i want to keep the received file inside the ""test"" folder. i need to make change to the following line of my previous code segment:..using (filestream fstream = new filestream(path.getfilename(cmdfilename), filemode.create))...but what change will i have to make?"
