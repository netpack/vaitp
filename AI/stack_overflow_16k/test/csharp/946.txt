"how to deal progressbar from another form why does my attempt at this fail?..i made this public on form1.designer.cs..public system.windows.forms.progressbar progressbar1;...and i can check it shares form..public partial class form3 : form...and then tried this to update increment on another form ""form3""..form1.progressbar1.increment(10);...i made this somewhat weird try because i saw simple ""classname.variablename"" for using data from another form working.....ps. if i am lucky enough to understand your generous answers... i think i will be able to bite off more of your further suggestions like ""how about try inheritance"" or ""make instance for this""... :)"
