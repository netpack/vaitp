"how to remove blank lines from a blank list<string>? i am trying to create a routine in blank that sorts a list added to a multi-line text box.  once that is done, there is an option to remove all blank lines.  can someone tell me how i would go about doing this?  here is what i have so far, but it doesn't work at all when i select the box and click sort:..private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.    char[] delimiterchars = { ',',' ',':','|','n' };.    list&lt;string&gt; sortbox1 = new list&lt;string&gt;(textbox2.text.split(delimiterchars));..    if (checkbox3.checked) //remove blank lines from list.    {.        sortbox1.removeall(item =&gt; item == ""rn"");.    }..    textbox3.text = string.join(""rn"", sortbox1);.}"
