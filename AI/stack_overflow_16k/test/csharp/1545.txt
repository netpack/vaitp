"blank - missing assembly/reference, object-oriented programming i cannot seem to find the error to fix my code. i was given a tester class and was told to make the classes needed to run the tester properly. here is the code i'm having a problem with:..tester class..using system;.using school;..namespace school.{.    class tester.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            faculty sciencefac = university.createfaculty(""science"");.        }.    }.}...faculty class..using system;..namespace school.{..public class faculty.{.    public string faculty;..    public faculty(string faculty).    {.        this.faculty = faculty;.    }.}.}...university class..using system;..namespace school.{..public class university.{.    private int numoffaculties;..    public university().    {.        numoffaculties = 0;.    }..    public void createfaculty(string faculty).    {.        numoffaculties++;.        new faculty(faculty);//?????.    }..    public int numberoffaculties().    {.        return numoffaculties;  .    }.}.}...only the tester shows an error, is it something i am referencing wrong with the namespaces?"
