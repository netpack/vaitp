how can i modify a collection and set one field of the collection to a substring of a unique guid? i have the following collection:..ilist&lt;question&gt; questionlist;...where question is like this:..public class question.{.    public int questionid { get; set; }.    ....    public string questionuid { get; set; }.}...the questions in the collection have the value of questionuid set to null...is there some way i can modify this collection so the values are set to .a value that is equal to the last six characters of a guid?
