"what's the best way to implement tracking changes on your entities? the requirement is to track all changes made to an entity, track it to know who did it, when he did, etc. for example, i have a person entity, and a user has changed the name of the person; i'd like to keep that information somewhere...what's the best approach for this? or is there an existing framework to achieve this. ..i know that sql 2008 has support for tracking changes, but it's not an option for now, because a lot of our customers are already using sql 2005...is the logging application block of enterprise library a good candidate for this requirement? i've check it out a little bit but, i don't see how i can use it to track the who did it, what value has change, when he did it, etc...we are using blank and .net framework for our app."
