"string to verify i am a blank.net developer..i wanted to check if a source string contained all of the characters in the destination string..ex:..source string      : test check.destination sting  : check test...then wanted to check if each char(t,e,s,t,c,h,e,c,k) are present in the destination string?.the source string can contain numeric/alphanumeric/special characters to compare with destination string...we can verify by loop through each &amp; every character from the destination and match that to destination but that would takes time...is there any simple way to check this?"
