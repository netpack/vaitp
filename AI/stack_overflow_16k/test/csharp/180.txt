"how do i calculate bpm (beats per minute)? i'm trying to write a winforms application that calculates the beats per minute of click, similar to this website: https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm but nothing works for me...i've tried to create a system.diagnostics.stopwatch object to count the number of milliseconds, and divide that by 60,000 to get the number of minutes that pass, but that doesn't count what the future..public stopwatch stopwatch = new stopwatch();..public form1().{.    initializecomponent();.}.float i = 0f;.private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.    if (!stopwatch.isrunning) { stopwatch.start(); }.    i++;.    speed.text = string.format(""speed: {0} bpmnclicks: {1} clicks"", i / millis(), i);.}        .private float millis().{.    var returntype = stopwatch.elapsedmilliseconds / 60000;.    return returntype + 1;.}...this just counts the number of times you've clicked the button and divides it by the number of minutes that have passed, and doesn't predict at the rate of clicking."
