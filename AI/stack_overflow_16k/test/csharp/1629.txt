"trying to call methods between classes created dynamically i have been trying to work out how to call a method in a different class. both classes are created dynamically at run-time. most of the issues i have seen here relate to inheritance, which is different from what i have (i think.)..i am still fairly new to blank, and am trying to test some concepts out...the first class is something like this:..public class record.{.    custompanel _panel;..    public void recordfunc(){}.}...the internally created class has something like this:..public class custompanel : panel.{.    list&lt;control&gt; _mycontrols = new list&lt;control&gt;;.    // _mycontrols[0] += new eventhandler(myfunc);..    public void myfunc(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        // parentclass.recordfunc();.    }.}...my objective is to create a record at run-time from a database call. at that point, it creates a panel (from my custompanel class) that gets added to a flowlayoutcontrol. when events are fired from the panel's internal controls, i need to have it update parts of the parent record class...any help is greatly appreciated."
