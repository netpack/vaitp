"permissions on a hidden share is there a way in blank to check whether a given user (in particular a sqlserver service account) has permissions on a hidden share? ..i have tried directorysecurity.getaccessrules to find out if they have access to the directory, but that didn't tell me if they had access to the share...i have tried using netsharegetinfo but this doesn't seem to work for hidden shares."
