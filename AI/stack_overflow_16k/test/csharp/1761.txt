"blank value does not fall within expected range hello i am getting a weird error in my application. ..there are times when i open my form in design view (form not running), i do not get any error, and sometimes i get an error value does not fall within expected range...when i close my solution and open it again, the form works fine,then start running the application, and  stop it and  open the form (same stuff, it may work or sometime it may not work)...also this does not always happen to the same form, it happens to random different form, sometimes i can get it in form 1, sometimes in form 2,"
