"how to rewrite doubles only for odd index except uppermost row with odd and keep all doubles with even index how to rewrite all duplicate lines in my text document, but only if duplicate line has odd index number and keep only one with odd which is above the all in order and keep all duplicates with even indexes...for example with content: ..01. line1.02. line2.03. line3    &lt;-- keep this with odd index because it is first in order  .04. line4.05. line5.06. line6.07. line3    &lt;-- rewrite this double because it is not first with odd index.08. line8.09. line9.10. line3    &lt;-- keep this double, because line  index is even number .11. line11 .12. line3    &lt;-- keep this double, because line  index is even number .13. line3    &lt;-- rewrite this double.14. line3    &lt;-- keep this double, because line  index is even number"
