"terminate application process on application close i'm having some issues with terminating an application process after closing the application with the application close button...the application uses multiple forms and utilizes mdi parent/child interface...in each form .cs file, i have the following code (substituting formname with the actual form name):..private void formname_closing(object sender, formclosingeventargs e).{.    environment.exit(0);.}   ...if i close the first window that opens after the application starts, the process ends as expected. however, if i open a new form with a button (new mdi child) and click the application close button, the application closes, but the process is still active in the task manager...i have tried using application.exit in lieu of environment.exit(0) but to no avail...is there any way to terminate the whole application process when any form is closed?"
