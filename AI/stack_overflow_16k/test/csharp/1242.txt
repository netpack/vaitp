"understanding parentheses within if statements i'm going through some blank coding exercises and have run into some operator logic that's stumped me. ..the following line of code evaluates to false:..int a = 40, int b = 50;..if (a &gt;= 20 &amp;&amp; a &lt;= 30 &amp;&amp; (b &lt; 20 || b &gt; 30)).    {.       return a;.    }...however, if i remove the brackets from inside the if statement, it evaluates to true...if (a &gt;= 20 &amp;&amp; a &lt;= 30 &amp;&amp; b &lt; 20 || b &gt; 30).     {.            return a;.     }...can anyone explain what i'm missing? given that a isn't between 20 and 30, shouldn't it return false? i don't understand why putting the b portion of the if statement in brackets makes it evaluate to false...is it evaluating everything prior to ""b > 30"" as a single condition?"
