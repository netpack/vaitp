"iterate over classes with different structure i need to show instances of above classes in html table. all objects should be ordered by speed property...public class bus { public float speed {get; set;} public string name {get; set;}}.public class tram { public float speed {get; set;} public string name {get; set;}}.public class car { public float speed {get; set;} public string name {get; set;}}.public class bike .{ .    public float speed {get; set;}.    public string name {get; set;}.    public double height {get; set;}.    public double width {get; set;}.}...table looks like:..  name | speed | height | width..bus    |   180   |            |.bus    |   179   |            |.bike   |   30    |    23      |  32.tram   |   23    |            |...how i could iterate over this objects and then display them? should i implement some interface?.it would be extremly easy if all classes has the same fields but in this case, bike class has four properties."
