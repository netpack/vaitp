"converting values using a text file i'm trying to write a console application in blank which allows a user to enter the following information in the format x,pound,ounce where x is the value to be converted...i've created a text file which contains the conversion factors in the following format...pound,ounce,16.0..what i want the application to do is to grab the user input and then find the correct conversion factor within the text file and then calculate the result...i've tried using a node class to cycle through the list of conversion factors but it doesn't seem to work =(..can you help?"
