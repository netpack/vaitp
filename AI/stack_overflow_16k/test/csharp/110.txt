"how to get scrollbar value in two label in different form i create an application that can display the temperature (in label) with a hscrollbar in 2 different form. i have 2 form, one is call ""capteur"" and she have a label and the scrollbar, the second is call ""afficheur"" and who have a label as well. .in the form ""capteur"" i change the text label easily with the event valuechanged :..        private void hreglagetemperature_valuechanged(object sender, eventargs e) {.            afficheur.temp = this.hreglagetemperature.value;.            this.ltempcapteur.text = string.format(""{0}Â°c"", afficheur.temp); //ltempcapteur is the name of the label.        }...but in my form ""afficheur"" (which is the form2) i can't change the text of my label by the value of the scrollbar, since i don't have valuechanged event of the scrollbar...i only have this code in my form ""afficheur"":..    public partial class afficheur : form {..        int temp = 0;..        public afficheur() {.            initializecomponent();.        }..        public int temp {.            get =&gt; temp;.            set =&gt; temp = value;.        }...i have already tried to add in my valuechanged event the name of the label of the form ""afficheur"" but it doesn't work."
