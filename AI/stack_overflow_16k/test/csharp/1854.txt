"loading assemblies in blank application at runtime not present in application working directory i am developing a blank console application that requires some 3rd party assemblies(dll). on dev machine, i know about the location of these assemblies so i can add them as reference to vs2010 project. but i am not sure of these assemblies path at client(user) machine..i can get these assemblies location from an environment variable or by an registry value ( may be added by 3rd party tool or by user). .so how will my application load these assemblies?"
