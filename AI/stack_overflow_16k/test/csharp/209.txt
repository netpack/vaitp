"is there any penalty between appending string vs char in blank when developing in java a couple of years ago i learned that it is better to append a char if i had a single character instead of a string with one character because the vm would not have to do any lookup on the string value in its internal string pool...string stringappend = ""hello "" + name + "".""; .string charappend = ""hello "" + name + '.'; // better?...when i started programming in blank i never thought of the chance that it would be the same with its ""vm"". i came across blank string theoryâ€”string intern pool that states that blank also has an internal string pool (i guess it would be weird if it didn't) so my question is,..are there actually any benefits in appending a char instead of a string when concatenating to a string regarding blank or is it just jibberish?..edit: please disregard stringbuilder and string.format, i am more interested in why i would replace ""."" with '.' in code. i am well aware of those classes and functions."
