"dynamic object (from json) has key called ""class"". visual studio interprets this as the keyword. how do you reference it? assume i have a json item like this:..items:.    0:.       name: test.       class: something.    1:.       name: test2.       class: something else...the json coming in varies, so i pass it into a dynamic object. my issue is when i try to get the 'class' value, visual studio throws errors...for example, ..dynamic response = jsonconvert.deserializeobject&lt;dynamic&gt;(jsonabove);..foreach (var item in response.items).    {.        var temp = item.class; //vs fails here. the text ""class"" is coloured blue. vs is treating it like the keyword class..    }...how can i retrieve the value stored in the 'class' key?..thanks!"
