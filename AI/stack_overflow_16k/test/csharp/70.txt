adding key/value pairs to a dictionary i am using a dictionary to store some key value pairs and had a question on the best way to populate the dictionary. i need to do some other operations in order to find and add my key value pairs to my dictionary. after those operations i may have found a key/value to add to the dictionary or i could have found nothing. my question is how i should populate the dictionary. should i use a function that returns a key value pair if found and otherwise an empty one contained within a dictionary.add(function()) call? i dont want to add empty key/value pairs to the dictionary so im not sure how the return call for that function would work. or should i pass the dictionary to the function and add to it if needed? like ..function(dictionary) .{ if (pair found) {dictionary.add(pair)}}
