"problem with inserting a node at the end of linkedlist so i have a problem with this insertlast function in linkedlist...public static void insertlast(linkedlist&lt;person&gt; list, person data)  .{ .    linkedlistnode&lt;person&gt; head= list.first;.    linkedlistnode&lt;person&gt; rez = new linkedlistnode&lt;person&gt;(data);..    if(head == null)  .    {  .        head = rez;   .        return;  .    }   .    linkedlistnode&lt;person&gt; temp = head;    .    while (temp.next != null)   .    {.        temp = temp.next;    .    }  .    temp.next = rez;  .}...i don't even know if this code will insert at the end because i can't test it because at this code temp.next = rez; i get error: ..""property or indexer 'linkedlistnode.next' cannot be assigned to -- it is read-only.""..so if i understand correctly.next is read-only so i can't use it like this. now does anybody knows how to fix this?..i would really appreciate!..i can't use addlast method because i have to create my own function."
