"blank: best way to make an argument of a method unchangeable i have an existing method like below:.the method body has over 1000 lines of code that i can't bring it here, just in method body if the value of argument (i mean index_param) be changed then surly i get wrong results...public string calculatevalue(int index_param) {.    //a highly complicated transactional method which returns a string.}...i want to be sure the method body is not changing index_param during operation, and prevent it from changing the parameter..what do you prefer for this scenario?"
