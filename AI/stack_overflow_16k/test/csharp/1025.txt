"how to write a console application that determines the largest element in a given series of integers write a console application that determines the largest element in a given series of integers..the numbers are entered one by one, and the application will read them one by one until the user enters the number 0. when the number 0 is entered, the application knows that all the numbers in the string have been entered and displays the largest number...number 0 is also a part of the string, and if it is the largest user-entered number then the application will return 0...example:..for input:..24.1.-3.3.-1.0.the console will display:..24..and my code is.. string[] numbers = new string[10];..        for(int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++){.            numbers[i] = ""0"";.        }..        int biggest = 0;..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++).        {.            numbers[i] = console.readline();.            if(numbers[i] == ""0"").            {.                break;.            }...i can't figure out how to continue to resolve this problem. did i start it in the right way? please help!"
