"ref argument is not classified as a variable - better fix for this? i have this piece of code that was converted from vb.net...    private static void privateexecutenonquery(ref providers enumprovider, ref string statement, ref commandtype commandtype, ref arraylist paramcollection, ref idbconnection conn, ref int16 commandtimeout).    {.        executesqlservernonquery(ref statement, ref commandtype, ref paramcollection, ref (sqlconnection)conn, ref commandtimeout);.    }...i am getting an error because it's saying the ref (sqlconnection)conn is not in the form of a variable so i guess you can't pass in method params for a ref?..so this seems like a hacky solution to me though:..    private static void privateexecutenonquery(ref providers enumprovider, ref string statement, ref commandtype commandtype, ref arraylist paramcollection, ref idbconnection conn, ref int16 commandtimeout).    {.        sqlconnection sqlconnection = (sqlconnection)conn;..    executesqlservernonquery(ref statement, ref commandtype, ref paramcollection, ref sqlconnection, ref commandtimeout);.    }...anyone know of a better way to satisfy this ref or make this cleaner?"
