"can't pass func arguments within method i'm trying to pass a func&lt;tresponse, t1, t2&gt; through to this method. i keep getting a syntax error for ""method()"" though. it says it needs two arguments which makes sense, but how do i pass it to the method? i've assigned them as t1 and t2...how can i make this return the tresponse as well?..the way i'm calling it (the func i want to use to call the method)..._service.count(filedate (datetime), cycle int));...what am i doing wrong here?..public tresponse executeandlog&lt;t1, t2,tresponse&gt;(guid id, string name, func&lt;t1, t2, tresponse&gt; method) where tresponse : class.{.    try.    {.        log(id, name);.        tresponse x = method();.        log(id, name);.    }.    catch (exception ex).    {.        log(id, name);.        throw;.    }.}"
