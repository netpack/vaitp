"visual studio blank interact with website i want to make an application that can interact with an existing website. the website has some search related text box fields that a user usually types stuff into and then clicks a button to go the next page. i'd like to automate this process by making a visual studio blank application. i'm not sure where to start, it seems like most tutorials out there are geared towards creating your own website that does stuff, not interacting with an existing one...as far as i can tell, typing into the search and clicking the button doesn't seem to create a unique url string (not like google maps does), because the url doesn't change when it take me to the search results. i'm not sure what type of tcp commands i need to send (i know about ""get"", but that's about it)...any pointers?"
