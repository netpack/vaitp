how to instantiate main window form correctly? i'm trying to make instance of the main form1 but i don't know clearly where/how to do it...in main program entry point there is  application.run(new programtalking()); do i replace it with .form1 mymainform = new form1();.mymainform.show(); ?..i'm kinda lost in how to correctly instantiate and where to do it. for example i can instantiate my second form2 and store it in memory but first form1 just runs and i cant have any access to it from form2 despite setting fields and properties to public. however i can effortlessly access form2 from my from1. thank you for any help.
