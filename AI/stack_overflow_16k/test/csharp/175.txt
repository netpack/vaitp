"textbox scrollbar. scrolling to end of textbox within thread i've tried all the answers suggest in stack overflow to get my scrollbar to move to the bottom as text is being updated, but i have a feeling its not working because it's within a thread. my code is below .....foreach(htmlagilitypack.htmlnode paginationuser in paginationusers) {.                    string userurl = paginationuser.getattributevalue(""id"","""");.                    this.invoke((methodinvoker)delegate { .                        txtlog.appendtext(""...... added "" + userurl + environment.newline);.                        txtlog.select(txtlog.text.length, 0);.                        txtlog.scrolltocaret();..                    });.                }...is it the thread thats causing the code not to work? and what's a better solution?"
