"running a for loop in a foreach loop i have to write the contents in this format..somename1  value1 value2 value1 value2 .....somename2  value1 value2 value1 value2 .....somename3  value1 value2 value1 value2 .....somename4  value1 value2 value1 value2 .....somename5  value1 value2 value1 value2 .......value1 and value2 are the part of the x and y co-ordinates of a point, so for this i have created a class:..class points.{. string name;. double[] x;. double[] y;.}..class pointscollection.{.  list&lt;points&gt; apoints.}..//now when accessing the pointcollection.foreach(points apoints in pointscollection).{.   stream.write(apoints.name).   //now i have to write the value1 and valud2..}..possible code..//now when accessing the pointcollection.foreach(points apoints in pointscollection).{.   stream.write(apoints.name).   int length1 = apoints.real;.   int length2 = apoints.imag;.   for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; length1; i++).   {.            stream.write(apoints.real[i]);.            stream.write("","");.            stream.write(apoints.imag[i]);..    }.     stream.writeline();..}...question : is it the correct to use for loop inside the foreachloop?"
