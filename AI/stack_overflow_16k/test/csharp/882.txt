"what is the best way of storing info without using external database or table? ok, so what i need to is something simple at first look. i have a win app with a text box, lets say textbox1...i want to return a value based on what the user writes in the box like this: i have 100 values with a corresponding text that i want to display....for value ""dan"" in textbox i want to display ""text 1"" in another box.for ""jake"" i want ""text 2""...and so on. i already have this correspondence in an excel table so i know what to display but to make 100 if clauses or cases it's not that pretty...anyway i can store this list in the app and just do a lookup or something and the the right value?..edit 1: based on hogan's reply...i created a button and used it to create the dictionary and insert 2 values in the dictionary..i created another button to retrieve the value from dictionary. ..it works only if i add the values and retrieve them in the same run. if i close the app and try and retrieve the dictionary is empty...edit 2: hogan's solution..i declared the dictionary as public...    dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; mylookup;...i added the dictionary creation in the button code:..    private void button7_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        mylookup = new dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();..        mylookup.add(""dan"", ""text 1"");.        mylookup.add(""jake"", ""text 2"");.    }...and i created another button to get the data:..    private void button8_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        messagebox.show(mylookup[""dan""]);.    }...if i click the first button to add the data and then the second to retrieve it works. if i close the app and reopen, and click directly the second one, it doesn't work...edit 3: i went with external file, steve's solution. since the ""no external file"" solution is too hard to make (too many rows of code to write down)."
