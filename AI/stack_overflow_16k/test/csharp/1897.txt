"end execution of namespaces after namespace with if statement finishes in csharp i am trying to build a simple program that will perform checks within namespaces and move to another part of the code with also namespaces included...namespace a.{.    class program.    {.        static void main().        {.            if (condition) {.            return; // stop execution of the namespace b.           {.        }.    }.}...namespace b.{.    public class something.    {.        public static void run().        {.         do something;.            }.        }.    }.}.....edited namespace b, to exclude void main() as per suggestion. that is actual structure of the code i am trying to run...i am expecting to evaluate the if statement in namespace a and make a decision whether to proceed to namespace b. i have tried including part of the code from namespace b in a, and that works, but i need to have an option to expand my checks and would like to make it neatly organized...can anyone help?....clearer example: my first program b.cs is as described below:..namespace b.{.    public class something.    {.        public static void run().        {.         do something;.            }.        }.    }.}...i needed to add another functionality (i have separate a.cs, d.cs, c.cs) to this program that will perform checks whether or not to run this program. i am trying to see what is the best way to combine the code."
