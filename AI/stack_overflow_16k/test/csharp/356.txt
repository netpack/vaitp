"how to dynamically set the value of a property of object instance using reflection? given a basic class definition:..using system.reflection;..public class car().{.  public int speed {get;set;}..  public void setspeed().  {.       type type = this.gettype(); .       propertyinfo property = type.getproperty(propertyname );.       property.setvalue(type, convert.toint32(propertyvalue), null);.  }.}...this code sample is simplified and not using dynamic type conversion, i just want a working sample to set that property on the instance. ..edit: propertyname and propertyvalue in above code is also simplified. ..thanks in advance"
