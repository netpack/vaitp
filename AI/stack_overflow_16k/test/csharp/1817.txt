"infer type parameter i'd like to create a new something&lt;t&gt; via a factory method...my idea would be something like:..somethingfactory.build&lt;t&gt;().    .othermethod(...).    .othermethod(...);...every t must be of type iinterface&lt;s&gt;...is there any way to be able to access s inside the build method without requiring it as a second generic parameter?..i then need to create another unrelated type unrelated&lt;s&gt; inside build and pass it as an argument to something&lt;t&gt;. ..i was expecting something like:..public static something&lt;t&gt; build&lt;t&gt;().    where t : iinterface&lt;s&gt;.{..}...to work, but it doesn't know how to infer s and errors out with:...  the type or namespace name 's' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) (cs0246)...how can i achieve something equivalent?"
