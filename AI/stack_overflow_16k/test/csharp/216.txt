"blank datetime.tryparseexact when reading string of date from excel i'm trying to read a list of string from excel and parse it to a date...i specified the format of the string in excel was d/m/yyyy but sometimes i got the string in the format dd/mm/yyyy, d/mm/yyyy, d/m/yyyy hh:mm:ss, dd/m/yyyy h:m:ss, ........ etc...i don't care what the time is and i only want to get the string of date and parse it to a date. do i need to define a huge array to contain all the combination of format of date and time before calling tryparseexact? or is there any smart way to do so?"
