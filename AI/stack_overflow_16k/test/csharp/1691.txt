"when to use a dataset? i'm new to programming and got stuck trying to understand the use of of a dataset in a multiuser environment..what i don't understand is: ...if user a pulls data to a ds and user b make changes to the db, are the changes going to be updated on user a's ds before they also make changes?.is there any other way to directly interact with the db without using a dataset if an answer to the above is no?"
