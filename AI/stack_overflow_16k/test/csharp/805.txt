"blank socketasynceventargs - sendpacket i'm currently changing my server code, from tcplistener to socketasynceventargs. i'm using this great code of stan kirk (https://www.codeproject.com/articles/83102/c-socketasynceventargs-high-performance-socket-cod). problem, that i currently vie; is that my server, short after accepting new connection, instead of receiving must send a packet of 10 bytes. (byte[] _packet = new byte[10] { 10, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1 };) i'm not quite sure how to do it. may anyone help me, in writing an easy sendpacket function, so i may easily send my byte arrays into the incoming socket?"
