"program broken, not sure why variables are wrong i need help with a class assignment, i use try-catch at first but now he wants me to try and do the error checking without try-catch. i had it working and then he also wanted me to use a method for the math that had executing twice and have now broken my program and i'm not sure why...the program is supposed to take two numbers, and then display the sum, quotient, product, and difference. but as far as i can tell the math is being done with random numbers...using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;.using system.threading.tasks;..namespace teamstuff.{.    class program.    {..        static void main(string[] args).        {.            double one = 2, two = 1;.            string check = null;..            while (true).            {.                console.writeline(""enter number 1: "");.                check = console.readline();..                if (checkparse(check, one) == true).                {.                    one = convert.todouble(check);.                    break;.                }..            }..            while (true).            {.                console.writeline(""enter number 2: "");.                check = console.readline();..                if (checkparse(check, two) == true).                {.                    two = convert.todouble(check);.                    if (two == 0).                    {.                        console.writeline(""you cannot divide by zero, try again."");.                    }.                    else.                    {.                    one = convert.todouble(check);.                        break;.                    }.                }..            }..            console.writeline(""sum="" + (one + two) +.
