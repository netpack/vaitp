"how do i find out what user owns what process programmatically? okay, so what i'm attempting to do is find out the name of the user for which a given process belongs to...        process[] processlist = process.getprocesses();.        foreach (process p in processlist).        {.            console.writeline(p.id);..        }.        console.readline();...currently, i can find out the process id of each process, but not the user. is there a way to tell who the user is that owns the process if i know the process id?"
