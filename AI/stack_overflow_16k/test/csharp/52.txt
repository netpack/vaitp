"list property containing two types (string/int) i need to have a property that will be an array that can hold both ints and strings..if i set the property to an array of ints it should be ints so when i am searching through this array the search will be fast, and at odd times this property will also contain strings which the search will be slow..is there any other way other than the following to have a list that contain native types ...two properties one for ints and one for strings.use list&lt; object >...update:.the use-case is as follow.  i have a database field [referencenumber] that holds the values (integers and strings) and another field [sourceid] (used for other things) which can be used to determine if record holds an int or string...i will be fetching collections of these records based on the source id, of course depending on what the source is, the list either will be integers or strings.  then i will go through this collection looking for certain reference numbers, if they exist not add them or they dont then add them.  i will be pre-fetching a lot of records instead of hitting the database over and over.  ..so for example if i get a list for sourceid =1 that means they are ints and if searching i want the underline list to be int so the search will be fast. and if sourceid say is 2 which means they are strings and very rare its okay if the search is slow because those number of records are not that many and a performance hit on searching through strings is okay."
