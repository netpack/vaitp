"sha512 not returning equal in blank hash validation the 64 bytes are the same, but the == is returning false.  i am guessing there may be something wrong with the encoding, but i can not figure out what i am doing wrong.  any ideas to fix this?..public static byte[] hashsha512(string unhashedvalue).{.    sha512 sham = new sha512managed();.    byte[] hash = sham.computehash(encoding.utf8.getbytes(unhashedvalue));.    return hash;..}..public static bool validate(string enteredvalue, byte[] hashedvalue).{.    byte[] hash = hashsha512 (enteredvalue);.    return (hash == hashedvalue);.}...i tested this with a simple value and since they both call the same hash method i do not see how it can fail other than something in the encoding.  i am just using the built in system.security.cryptography."
