"invoke action with unknown type parameter (action<any>) i am creating an api, and my goal is to expose a method that can be invoked like this:..library.addcallback&lt;string&gt;(type.chatmessage, gotmessage);..private void gotmessage(string message) {.    //....}.//or.library.addcallback&lt;int&gt;(type.number, gotnumber);..private void gotnumber(int number) {.    //....}...the type &lt;int&gt;, &lt;string&gt; can be any type...in the library, the method looks something like this:..public void addcallback&lt;t1&gt;(object type, action&lt;t1&gt; callback) {.    //....}...the problem is that i somehow want to first save the callback outside of the method call (in a list) and then later be able to call it...what i ideally want to do is to first cast it to an object to be able to store it in a list&lt;object&gt; and then cast it back to action&lt;t1&gt;. however it seems like it is impossible to save t1 to a variable (except by doing typeof(t1) which denies me to use it to cast it back)...example of how i would like to call it (where i got type and data from a list):..((action&lt;type&gt;)callback)(data)"
