"how to read a txt file and show it as a table in a console application? i am sorry if i worded to question wrongly and caused confusion. but here is what i want to do. i want the program to read the txt file and then arrange the data into like a table format?..the txt file can look something like this:..fullname1|id1|age1|mark1.fullname2|id2|age2|mark2.fullname3|id3|age3|mark3...i have looked up several ways to do it but none of them worked for me, and i am self learning blank but my english is limited so it is hard for me to look for deeper solution."
