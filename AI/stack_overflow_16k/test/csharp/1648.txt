"get name (string) of new class/struct i looking for a way to get the name of a class (or struct) which is instantiate under blank 6. exemple :..public class test.{.public int myvalue;..public test(int _myvalue){ myvalue= _myvalue;}.}..void init().{.    public test test= new test(1);.}..void main().{.    string namenewtest = // here what i need, that must return ""test"", not ""test"".}...i saw lot of topics for find the type like : gettype().name/nameof/typeof(class).name or some stuff like that but no one for the name of a new variable."
