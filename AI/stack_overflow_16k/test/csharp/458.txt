"how can i make a label visible before the subsequent code is run? i have a method that takes several seconds to complete. i want to make a label visible during that time, so i used this code:..label.visible = true;.method();.label.visible = false;...when i run this code, the label's shape appears, but the text and colors don't. if i remove the third line of code, i can see that the label becomes fully visible only after the method completes. how can i make the label fully visible before the method starts?"
