"understanding if logic in my code i thought i understood programming well enough to get the results i was looking for but alas this simply is not working for me.  i've reduced my code to a simple console application for assistance.  the goal was to print out a 5x5 grid of 1's and 0's.  actually, i wanted to create a random x and y value such as 2 and 1 and i call this emptyx and emptyy.  in this spot and only this spot, i should get a '0' printed.  in all other cells there should be '1'.  so it should be a grid of all 1's expect for the spot identified by emptyx and emptyy.  my code below, although works, puts zero's down the entire column and row.  ..why is this happening? i keep looking at my code and it seems my logic is good to me but of course it is not.  how else can i make the grid with only a single 0 at the spot emptyx and emptyy?..class program.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.        int emptyx = new random().next(5);.        int emptyy = new random().next(5);.        for (int y = 0; y &lt; 5; y++).        {.            for (int x = 0; x &lt; 5; x++).            {.                if ((x != emptyx) &amp;&amp; (y != emptyy)).                    console.write(""1"");.                else.                    console.write(""0"");.            }.            console.writeline();.        }.        console.readkey();.    }.}...something like this with the 2 and 1 example:..11111..11011..11111..11111..11111"
