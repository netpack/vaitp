"string instance behavior different than object string is an reference type (similar to object). why the diff behavior in the following scenario - when creating an instance of string and object? ..i understand the concept of immutability etc in string but that is to do with value assigned to string (which wont change). my question is more to do with why s2 is creating another complete instance whereas if i had done with object it doesnt do that?....example of string..class program.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.        string s1 = ""hello"";.        string s2 = s1;..        s1 = null;.        console.writeline(""s1 = "" + s1);.        console.writeline(""s2 = "" + s2);.        console.readline();.    }.}...output: s2 still prints ""hello""..example of object..class program.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.        name s1 = new name();.        s1.id = 5;.        name s2 = s1;..        s1 = null;.        console.writeline(""s1 = "" + s1.id);.        console.writeline(""s2 = "" + s2.id);.        console.readline();.    }.}..public class name.{.    public int id { get; set; }.}...output: both s1 and s2 are null;"
