"saving an xml file to a specific folder i am trying to write code that will save an xml file to a location, so i attempted using..path.combine(path.getdirectoryname(assembly.getexecutingassembly().location), @""settings.xml"");...which returns the directory ""c:usersmynamedesktopprogramfolderassemblysettings.xml"" i am using this code to give me a general idea of where the user is executing my program since it is a portable program. now knowing where the program is being executed i want to create my file in the directory ""programfoldersettings"" which already exists. i am just not sure how i can go about doing this"
