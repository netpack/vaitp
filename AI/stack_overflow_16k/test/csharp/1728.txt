"changing value in class from form and reading it from another class, possible? i must admit i'm quite the beginner as far as coding goes...right now i want to change a boolean value in a class by pressing a button in the main form...but i also want to read the changed value from another class...is this even possible ? i'm using blank btw...because right now i have the problem that using class1 class = new class1(); creates unique versions of the class for the form1 and the class calling it."
