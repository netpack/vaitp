"blank list running applications which have a gui how could i list all running applications which have a gui in blank? i am trying to make some sort of a taskbar, so i have to know what processes are running. i can't list all processes  of course, because that would be a total disaster. my idea is to only list processes with a gui, because that seems like what's happening in the ""stock"" taskbar."
