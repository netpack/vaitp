"basic math operation in blank i'm learning and have glanced over simple math operations in blank. however, a point that may be easy-peasy seems interesting that typically i know about division an integer by an another integer number is zero if first one is smaller than second one. so, i have looked at operator precedence in blank because maybe i have the wrong information about it. so, what about console.writeline((1 + 1) / 2 * 3); shouldn't it give zero as a result? but it gives 3. is there a point that i have wrong knowledge about blank?..@edit: the problem is about my arithmetic. i think it should be 2 / 2 * 3 then 2 / 6 = 0 why division takes place before multiplication?..@edit 2: the question can be closed. it is exactly about my wrong knowledge on precedence of operators. i had thought like a real math procedure in programming until now. i'm in shock. advantages of the reading again and again and not skipping even if you supposed as i know the subject already..@edit 3: after some time, i realized that there are some sorts of evaluation of math expressions called as like, pemdas, bodmas, bedmas and bidmas. that's why i got it wrong at first."
