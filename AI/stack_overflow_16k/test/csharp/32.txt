"how to create a folder then create a csv file inside it i have an exe that already creates a csv file. if i save the exe in c:/exe, then the cvs file automatically gets created in c:/exe folder..blank code uses streamwriter to accomplish this:..using (textwriter log = new streamwriter(errorlog + errorbatchnumber.tostring(""000"") + "".csv"", true)).{.    if (errorcount == 0).    {.        log.writeline(""error message"");.    }.    log.writeline(link.statusmessage);.    log.close();.}...what i need to add:...a folder needs to be created first where the csv file will be saved..this folder will be created where the exe was saved, in this example: c:/exe.after folder and cvs file was created, it needs to be zipped thru code. (but i need to accomplish first 1 and 2) ...any ideas?.thanks in advance guys! :)"
