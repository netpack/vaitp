"problem on a struct exercise i'm currently learning about structs, so i have the following exercise:.set a struct that called ""date"" that contains date, including: year, month and day. also, define a class called phone that contains a name, number, date of birth and address. you need to create an array that contains objects of type phone and sort them by name, number, and date..alright, so this is the code:..  struct date.{.    int year, month, day;.    public date(int year, int month, int day).    {.        this.year = year;.        this.month = month;.        this.day = day;.    }.    public int year.    {.        get { return year; }.        set {year = value; }.    }.    public int month.    {.        get { return month; }.        set { month = value; }.    }.    public int day.    {.        get { return day; }.        set { day = value; }.    }.}.    class phone.{.    string number;.    string adress; .    string name;.    date birthday = new date(); .    public phone(string number,date birthday, string adress, string name).    {.        this.number = number;.        this.birthday = birthday;.        this.adress = adress;.        this.name = name;.    }..}.class program.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.        phone[] p = new phone[3];.        p[0] = new phone(1072548,.     }.}...i'm having no error but the problem is that i don't know how to get the birthday from the ""date"" struct, and that's why i stopped putting in the information..thanks."
