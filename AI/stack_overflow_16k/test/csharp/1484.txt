"best way to store multiple revisions of a text file to a single file i'm working on a blank application that needs to store all the successive revisions of a given report file to a single project file: each time the (plain text) report file changes, the contents of the new version shall be appended to the project file, along with some metadata. other requirements:...each version of the report file is 100 kb to 1 mb. theoritically, the maximum number of revisions is unlimited but it should be less than 1000 in practice. .to keep things simple, i'd like to avoid computing differences between the revisions of the report - just store the whole report to the project file every time it has changed..the project file should be compressed - it doesn't need to be a text file.it should be easy to retrieve a given version of the report from the application...how can i implement this in an efficient way? should i create a custom binary file, consider using a database, other ideas?..many thanks, guy."
