"how would this be written correctly? these if statements i just realized are completley wrong..i only need to call the revokeassignments() method or the revokequeues() method if there was a chkbx.checkedchanged. so basically if you change the status of a check box, checked or unchecked it would recognize which ones were checked and are not anymore and then call these methods. ..it's a blank program, winform in vs2013.. thanks in advance..so, how would the code be written that would correctly call these methods? do i have to write an if statement for every possible change? because that seems redundant...       if (chkbxconsolepld.checked == true || chkbxdfwov.checked == true || chkbxfloormat.checked == true || chkbxgeopointead.checked == true.            || chkbxgeopointebp.checked == true || chkbxjobcc.checked == true || chkbxnewjob.checked == true || chkbxpopro.checked == true.            || chkbxreported.checked == true || chkbxsalesaccq.checked == true || chkbxservmax.checked == true || chkbxwordorddel.checked == true).        {.            revokeassignments();.        }.        if (chkbxatlanta.checked == true || chkbxdallas.checked == true || chkbxdallascc.checked == true.            || chksoutherncities.checked == true || chkbxpending.checked == true || chkbxclosedcanc.checked == true).        {.            revokequeues();.        }"
