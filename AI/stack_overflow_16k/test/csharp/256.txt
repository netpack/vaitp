"blank set property values in ""bulk"" (by excluding) in blank i have several classes where i have the following ""logic"":.. //obja and objb are instances of the same class. obja.property1 = objb.property1;. obja.property2 = objb.property2;. obja.property3 = objb.property3;. obja.property4 = objb.property4;. ...... obja.property40 = objb.property40;...i do not want to apply the value to all the properties (but a big part of them)...this is getting repetitive and if somehow the ""class"" changes where there is a new property there is no compilation error and if the programmer does not pay attention there will be a bug because we will be losing that property change..... ..i was wondering if there is a way to the following: ..--> apply the value of all the properties excluding the ones that specifically point, something like:..    //possible syntax .    obja.setallpropertiesless(objb, x =&gt; x.id &amp;&amp; x.createdate &amp;&amp; x.isdeleted);     ...does not need to be so ""fancy"" like this one, but for starting i would like to know if there is already something similar in the .net framework, then if not, perhaps someone would already have an implementation (lightweight/fast)."
