"how to refresh progressbar accurately i wrote a short method that uses a for loop 2 times:..progressbar1.minimum = 1;.progressbar1.maximum = 1000000;.progressbar1.step = 1;..for (int idx = 1; idx &lt; 1000000; idx++).{    .    progressbar1.performstep();.}..thread.sleep(2000);.progressbar1.invalidate();.this.update();..progressbar1.value = 1;.for (int idx = 1; idx &lt; 1000000; idx++).{.    progressbar1.performstep();.}...my question is this: on the 1st pass, when the value gets to 1000000 the actual colored bar only.displays about 50-75% across, but never 100% across, even though the value has reached the maximum...this is unique to using the progressbar multiple times in one method...how can i get the actual colored bar to get to the very end?..(apparently its a buffering thing?)"
