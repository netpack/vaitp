"blank: need to remove last folder from file name path i'm pulling a file path from a database to use as a file source..i need to remove the last folder from the source path, so i can then create new folders to use as the destination path...example source file path:.\\servername\documents\masterdocumentfolder\..i need to remove the last folder from that string and get this:.\\servername\documents\..so i can create a folder like this:.\\servername\documents\newdocumentfolder1\..edit: i have updated my example paths to show why the path.getdirectoryname() won't work in this case."
