"largest file not being displayed i'm doing a programming assignment which is based around file sorting. i'm having a problem with working out the largest file. what i want the below code to do is to show the largest file in my system. instead, it's going through a full listing of all the files i have. ..here is my code for this particular section:..                for (int index = 0; index &lt; files.length; index++).                {..                    filesize = files[index].length;..                    long largestsofar = 0;..                    folderinfo = new directoryinfo(""c:\windows"");.                    files = folderinfo.getfiles();..                    if (filesize &gt; largestsofar).                    {                            .                        string filename = files[index].name;.                        largestsofar = files[index].length;.                        long largestfile = largestsofar;.                        console.writeline(""largest file: {0}, {1} bytes"", filename, largestsofar);.                        // it should be that only the largest file gets shown..                    }.                }"
