"comparing two numbers (greater than, equal to or less than) without if statements i have a task on my blank programming book that i need to program a:...  ""program that reads two numbers from the keyboard and prints if the number 1 is bigger than, equal to or less than number 2....the reason i assume i can't use if statements is because they have not yet been covered. this task is given before the book teaches the if statements. i have been trying to figure this out, do i need to use the ? operator..? it would be easy if it asked only if it's less than or greater than, less than or equal to or equal to or greater than number 2, but now there's 3 different things...the book already teached ? operator, but not compareto. i wouldn't believe it left me to guess the existence of if-statement, because all the tasks in it should be able to entirely be solved with things that have already been taught. the book is about to teach the if-statement basically just on the next page of this task though...this is the furthest i've got :p..int number1 = convert.toint32(console.readline());..int number2 = convert.toint32(console.readline());"
