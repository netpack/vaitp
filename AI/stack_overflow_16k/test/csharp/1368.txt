"i want to understand the inner working of a collections.list<t> i've created my own list with a static int as length. how are these things done when you don't know the size of a collection and you want to construct it. i know there is a build in list but i want to build my own to understand the inner working of it. i defined it as size = int 5 in the constructor so it will output now 1 2 3 0 0 and i want to know how to resize it and using a constructor with undefined length. i can't figure it out myself some help is appreciated. ..i fixed it. thanks for the answers guys really fast and easy to understand i never heard from the .net reference so thanks for the site...namespace consoleapplication1.{.class program.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {.        list l = new list();.        l.add(1);.        l.add(2);.        l.add(3);.        l.add(4);..        foreach (int n in l).        {.            console.writeline(n);.        }..        console.read();.    }.}..class list.{.    private int _llength;.    private int[] _larray;.    private int _lpos;..    public list().    {.        /*.         * create an array with a default size.         * if it doesn't fit anymore create a new one and copy it.         * to a new array and double the size.         */.        this._larray = new int[2];.    }..    public list(int c).    {.        this._llength = c;.        this._larray = new int[this._llength];.        this._lpos = 0;.    }..    public void add(int n).    {.        if (this._larray.length &lt;= this._lpos).        {.            // so now is the array &lt; then the array we want to return.            int[] tmp = this._larray;.            this._larray = new int[tmp.length * 2];.            array.copy(tmp, this._larray, tmp.length);.        }..        this._larray[this._lpos++] = n;.    }..    public ienumerator&lt;int&gt; getenumerator().    {.        foreach (int n in this._larray).            yield return n;.    }.}.}"
