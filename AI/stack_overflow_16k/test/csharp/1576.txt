"how would i make something like a switch statement, but for multiple conditions private bool test(int x, int y, int z).{.    int[] arr = {x,y,z};.    switch (arr).    {.        case {4,5,6}:.            return true;.        case {1,2,3}:.            return true;.        case {7,8,9}:.            return true;.        default:.            return false;.    }.}...essentially, i want to create a function that does this. however, you cannot use an array value inside a switch statement.  how would i accomplish something like this? i don't really want to do a bunch of if statements, there will be around ~300 possible combinations...for further clarification, the function will always return true if it finds a case, and returns false if it doesn't find a case. (order matters)  ..one possible solution is i convert the x y z value to a string, of ""x y z"" then have a case of ~300 string values.  but that seems pretty hacky."
