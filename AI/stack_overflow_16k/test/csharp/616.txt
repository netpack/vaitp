"is there a ""clean"" way to jump out of a ""try"" block without an exception in blank i have the following code. ..        try.        {.            if (vm.submitaction == ""cancel"").                return redirecttoaction(""showsummary"", new.                {.                    ds = vm.meta.datasourceid.                 });  &lt;------------------------------------------- xxxx.            _account.validatenoduplicate(vm.account);.            vm.account.modified = datetime.now;.            vm.account.modifiedby = user.identity.name;.            _account.addorupdate(vm.account);.        }.        catch (exception e) { .            log(e); return view(""createedit"", vm); .        }.        return redirecttoaction(""showsummary"", new {.            ds = vm.meta.datasourceid.        });...if the user hits the cancel button then i have code ( marked here with &lt;-- xxxx ) that redirects to an action. this code is the same as the code after the try block. is there a way that i can make my code exit from the try. the only way i can think of is to trigger an exception and i want a clean jump and not one that uses the exception as it's not an error for a user to click cancel."
