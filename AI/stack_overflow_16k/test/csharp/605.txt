"filesystemwatcher argumentexception i'm having trouble understanding how filesystemwatcher is supposed to work. i'm trying to get my code to wait for a file to exist, and then call on another function. my code is as follows:...  string path2 = @""n:reuthertimecheckcavmsbayss.log"";...        filesystemwatcher fw = new filesystemwatcher(path2);.       fw.created += filesystemwatcher_created;...then i have a seperate function that should handle the file once its event is called:..        static void filesystemwatcher_created(object sender, filesystemeventargs e).    {.        messagebox.show(""ok im here now"");.    }...but it ..the directory name n:reuthertimecheckcavmsbayss.log is invalid."
