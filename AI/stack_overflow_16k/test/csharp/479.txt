"struggling with how methods and classes interact i'm new to learning blank and am trying to implement the below code however, i am unable to do so, receiving the error ""a namespace cannot directly contain members such as fields or methods""...namespace grades.{.    public string lettergrade.    {.        get.        {.            string result;.            if (roundresult(averagegrade) &gt;= 90).            {.                result = ""a"";.            }.            else if (roundresult(averagegrade) &gt;= 80).            {.                result = ""b"";.            }.            else if (roundresult(averagegrade) &gt;= 70).            {.                result = ""c"";.            }.            else.            {.                result = ""f"";.            }.            return result;.        }.    }..    private double roundresult(double result).    {.        double r;.        r = math.round(result);.        return r;.    }..    public class gradestatistics.    {.        public float averagegrade = 50;.        public float highestgrade = 78;.        public float lowestgrade = 11;.    }.}...what i am trying to accomplish is to create a method called ""roundresult"" which will round the ""averagegrade"" result. i am merely doing this as an experiment to try and understand how methods interact with each other...the biggest hurdle i am facing while learning blank is in regards to methods and classes, how to use them correctly, when to place them within an existing class or create there own separate class etc. if someone has any recommended resource that goes into extensive step by step detail on how to implement methods and classes, that would be greatly appreciated...edit: thanks to reputation farmer and wazdev for their answers. i'd like to add an additional question......why is the ""gradestatistic"" method a valid method to call the ""averagegrade"" from within the same class yet my ""roundresult"" method can not be within the same class?"
