"files and directory blank been working on file directory stuff in blank and i think i might just be forgetting something simple here. so lets says i have 4 folders and i need to check if the folder exists and then display the files within the folder. but the part that i'm stuck at is checking lets say the creationdate of a file with one of the four folders. almost like i'm missing the path actual path to the file within the folder. here the code that i had so far. ...        string end;.        string directoryname;.        string filename;.        string[] listoffiles;..        console.write(""enter the name of the folder: "");.        directoryname = console.readline();.        while (directoryname != ""end"").        {.            if (directory.exists(directoryname)).            {.                console.writeline(""directory exists, and it contains the following:"");.                listoffiles = directory.getfiles(directoryname);.                for (int x = 0; x &lt; listoffiles.length; ++x).                    console.writeline(""   {0}"", listoffiles[x]);..            }..            console.write(""enter a filename: "");.            filename = console.readline();.            if(file.exists(filename)) // almost like a path needs to be here..            {.                console.writeline(""file was created "" + file.getcreationtime(filename));.            }.        }....just thought incase it was asked the programs exe and folders are all located together"
