"check document for types of questions and answers i am creating an application for my computing coursework where teachers upload a .txt file which contains questions for students and answers for each question...in the file each question begins with a symbol to denote the question type (e.g. &amp; denotes multiple choice), how should i check for the different questions?..i was thinking of using streamreader.readline() to read each line and then check position 0 of the string but is there a more effective way to do this?..here is what the question document would look like just with more questions;..&amp; multiple choice question.~correct answer.-incorrect answer.-incorrect answer.-incorrect answer..? textbox answer question.~correct answer"
