"print the line after a matching word from a text file (blank) i am reading from a text file which basically looks like:..&gt;name.&gt;12345..&gt;name2.&gt;32458..&gt;name3.&gt;82745...and so on. i want it so once the program detects name it prints both name and the line after it: 12345 to the console...here is my code so far:..if (args[0] == ""prog1"").{.    list&lt;string&gt; lines = file.readalllines(filename).tolist();..        foreach (var line in lines).        {.            if (line.contains(""name"")).            {.                console.writeline(line);.            }.        }.}...so far this only prints ""name"" to the console and i am unsure of how to get it to print the line after it as well."
