"blank count rows in datatable where all values of row equal to 1 i have a datatable in which the columns and rows are created at runtime, so as a result the column names may vary and row numbers too. values for each cell can only be 1 or 0...i may get a datatable with say for example 3 columns. e.g...age | sex | location.-------------------.1   | 0   | 1.-------------------.0   | 1   | 0.--------------------.1   | 1   | 1.--------------------.0   | 1   | 0.--------------------.1   | 1   | 1.--------------------...i want to be able to count only the rows which contain 1 on each column. so above example would return 2."
