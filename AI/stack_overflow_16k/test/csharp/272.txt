"blank readline variable string to int i have a statement and then the user has to enter a key..if they enter one they do one thing and another, another thing...from my readline i have the problem where  ...  ""error cs0029: cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'string'""....what's the problem with this because i think i have:..choice = convert.toint32(console.readline());...edit ..so now i have used steve's answer (below)..this throws up this error message:...  cs0029: cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'bool'...and for this line i think:..case 1:.  // action for choice == 1.  if(choice = 1|2).     console.writeline(""choice {0} selected"",choice);.  break;"
