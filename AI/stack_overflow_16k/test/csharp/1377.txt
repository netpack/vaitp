"how to access instantiated objects from another class? i want to terminate the thread thr1 in program class from another class, .i created a poc code as shown below to demonstrate it better..assume my program class is as below:..public class program.    {.        public static thread thr1;.        public static void main(string[] args).        {.            thread thr1= new thread(() =&gt; class1.dosomething(param1,param2));.            thr1.start();.            thread.sleep(1000);.            test.exec();..        }.    }...and this is my test class:..public class test.{.    public static void exec().    {.        program.thr1.abort();.        program.thr1= new system.threading.thread(() =&gt; class1.dosomething(param1, param2));.        program.thr1.start();.    }.}...what i actually want to do is to terminate the thr1 in class program by the exec method in test class and reassign with different parameters and start it again. .is this possible?..edited: .maybe i should have asked how to access instantiated object from another class?"
