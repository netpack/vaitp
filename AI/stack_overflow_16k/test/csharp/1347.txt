"why is this marquee code not working? i'm using this code in order to make a marquee label that scrolls from right to left...    private int xpos = 651;..    private void timer1_tick(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        if (this.width == xpos).        {.            //repeat marquee.            xpos = 651;.            this.label7.location = new system.drawing.point(651, 334);.            xpos--;.        }.        else.        {.            this.label7.location = new system.drawing.point(xpos, 334);.            xpos--;.        }.    }...651 is the width of the form...this code makes the label go from right to left, scroll off the form like it should, but doesn't restart at the right again."
