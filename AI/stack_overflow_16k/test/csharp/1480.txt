"how to convert time only using datetime.parse? i have a string variable with it's value formatted to look like ""1:23:45 am"".i need to convert that into a datetime variable for time without a date component..i am receiving an ""unhandled exception"" error that is being caused by the formatting.  if i remove the ""am"", it works fine but the ""am/pm"" component is needed for what i am trying to do..i am currently using the following code to attempt this.....""temp"" is the name of the variable i am using until i come up with a more meaningful variable name.....public string plusminus12(string hour, string minute, string second, string ampm).    {.        string plusminus;.        int rndmtmp1 = random1();.        int rndmtmp2 = random2();..        if (rndmtmp1 == 0).        {.            plusminus = hour + "":"" + minute + "":"" + second + "": "" + ampm;.            return plusminus;.        }.        else if (rndmtmp1 == 1).        {.            string temp = hour + "":"" + minute + "":"" + second +"": "" + ampm;.            **datetime subtract = datetime.parse(temp);**.            subtract.addseconds(-rndmtmp2);.            plusminus = subtract.tostring(""h:mm:ss tt"");.            return plusminus;.        }.        else.        {...datetime subtract = datetime.parse(temp); is the line causing the error..the error is:..an unhandled exception of type 'system.formatexception' occurred in mscorlib.dll..additional information: string was not recognized as a valid datetime...most of the information i have found so far on this topic include solutions that depend on the existence of the date component, which i am not using...any ideas?.thank you"
