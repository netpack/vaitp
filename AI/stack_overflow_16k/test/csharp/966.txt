"trying to multiply the input from a text box and show the result on a label, but getting an error     decimal aprice = 15.75m;..    decimal asales = decimal.parse(txtasales.text);..    decimal arev = (aprice * asales);..    private void btncalculate_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        lblarev.text = arev.tostring();.    }...this is the code i have for it, what i'm trying to do is multiply the price of a-type tickets and the number of a-type tickets sold.  the number sold will be taken from the user in a text box ""txtasales"" which i got from the object window, and renamed in the properties window (no coding done for that).  then the revenue will be shown on a label ""lblarev"".  i am getting an error ""a field initializer cannot reference the non-static field, method, or property"" for txtasales, aprice, and asales."
