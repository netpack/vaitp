"tool to automatically covert a text string with special characters to a properly formatted blank string i had this really useful app in vb6 &amp; i was wondering if anyone knows of an equivalent one for blank.....basically the vb6 app allowed you to paste text into an input box and then it would produce an output text that was correctly formatted (with special characters) so that you could paste it directly in your code without having to convert special characters...for example.....input..say ""hello""..output..string s = ""say ""hello"""";...if anyone know of an equivalent free tool for blank, or something i can do in vs2008 that would avoid me having to do this process manually, it would be appreciated!"
