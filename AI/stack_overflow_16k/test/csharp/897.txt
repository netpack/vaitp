"blank logic issue when adding fields i have a list that has 4 records. if there are animals with the same age, i need to add their ages and add it as a separate column. for example look at the table below. ...  name | age | gender .  .  ant | 9 | m .  .  ant | 2 | m .  .  lion| 8 | m .  .  pig | 1 | f...there are 2 records that are duplicates (ant). i need to add the age of the duplicates so, there'll be a new record like:...  ant | 11 | m...all together there should be 5 records with the newly added row (added above)...the problem i am facing is, i am able to add the newly added record (which is by adding the age fields). however, this record overrides the first record in the initial field. how can i add this record as a new field...my code so far:..foreach (var animal in duplicates).{.        animal ani = listanimals.first(a=&gt; a.name.equals(animal.name));..        ani.age += animal.age;.}"
