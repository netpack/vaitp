"blank - finding maximum of 3 numbers using if / else statements i'm completely new to blank - just trying out some simple stuff..i want to find the maximum of three numbers, using if/else statements. i tried writing this method:..public int maximum(int num1, int num2, int num3).    {.        if (num2 &lt; num1 &gt; num3).        {.            return num1;.        }..        else if (num1 &lt; num2 &gt; num3).        {.            return num2;.        }..        else if (num1 &lt; num3 &gt; num2).        {.            return num3;.        }.    }...but i've gotten a bit confused...q1 - by saying ""int maximum"", do i still need to declare each parameter as being an int (or the same the other way round)? or does everything need its data type declared?..q2 - keeps telling me that ""operator '>' cannot be applied to operands of type bool and int""? i'm confused as to what i should do here. have i done something wrong or is there an alternative?..thanks for any help."
