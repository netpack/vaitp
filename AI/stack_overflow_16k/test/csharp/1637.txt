"writing the first 3 letters of a list<> in blank comming from c++ now learning blank and just want to know why this code doesn't work, the output is just a lot of errors, i saw another examples from the microsoft docs and they use something called var (specificly when using foreach) so when i tried to use it, vs tells me the var datatype doesn't exists(maybe a missing library?) is that the reason why .skip() does not work? so should i use var? just for writing the first 3 letters of the stack? i really can't tell what is wrong. actually that suposition i'm making for me is nonsense.. any help is appreciated...using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;.using system.threading.tasks;..namespace calendar.{.    class days.    {.        private list &lt;int&gt;    numbers_of_days;.        private list &lt;string&gt; names_of_days;..        public days().        {.            numbers_of_days = new list&lt;int&gt;();.            names_of_days = new list&lt;string&gt;.                            { ""monday"", ""tuesday"", ""wednesday"", ""thursday"", ""friday"", ""saturday"", ""sunday"" };..            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 31; i++).            {.                numbers_of_days.add(i);.            }..        }..        public void print_days().        {.            foreach (string day in names_of_days).            {.                console.write("" "" + day.skip(3));.            }.            console.writeline();.        }.    }.}"
