"access intersection point of between a curve graph and a line i have a curve chart and one line.i wanna gain their intersection point..i wrote below code. i compare points of two series to calculate intersection point. but it dose not work...foreach (datapoint series in chart.series[""t1""].points).        {.            foreach (datapoint item in chart.series[""t2""].points).            {..                for (int j = 1; j &lt; series.yvalues.length; j++).                {.                    for (int i = 1; i &lt; item.yvalues.length; i++).                    {.                        if (series.yvalues == item.yvalues).                        {.                            //some code.                        }.                    }..                }..            }.        }"
