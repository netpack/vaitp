"how to store database password in a program for it to access the database? i need my program to be able to connect to some kind of a database (e.g. sql) and obviously the program needs the password to get access to the database. and setting a hardcoded variable with a password would be more than enough but i want to think like it's a real life situation. so i want it to be stored securely, and hardcoding a password to the code from what i know is not a very good idea. how do i do it then? i searched multiple forums, topics and maybe there was an answer but im not gonna lie it is complicated. any help?"
