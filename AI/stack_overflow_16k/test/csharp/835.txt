"check if there item exist in the list blank i have game app that has 5 items with description and price. after i display description user guess the price and this item goes to to previous guesses list. when i am looping through my game and user finishes it, i want the console to ask user again if he want to play. in that case i don't want to show the item twice, meaning i need to make sure that i never show the product twice."
