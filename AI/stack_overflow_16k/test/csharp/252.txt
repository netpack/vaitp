converting primitive or non primitive dynamically to list i have an object that could be any type. i have a check to see if its an array and then i need to convert it to a list&lt;object&gt; if it is. i am having trouble handling the case where its a primitive array as shown below. it is not an ienumerable&lt;object&gt; in this case. note i cannot use linq in this framework:..object value = somefunction();.if( value.gettype().isarray ).{.  try.  {.     list&lt;object&gt; l = new list&lt;object&gt;( (ienumerable&lt;object&gt;)value );.  }.  catch(exception e).  {.    //here its failing because its no an object.  }.}...`
