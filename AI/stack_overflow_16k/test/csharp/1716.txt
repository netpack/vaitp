"how to show label image on click event i need to make a simple matching game. with this matching game i need to show an image when i click on it. before the click event there's only a color shown. i already have a method which assigns images to the labels like so:..    private void imgtolbl().    {.        foreach (control ctrl in tablelayoutpanel1.controls).        {.            label imglbl = ctrl as label;.            if (imglbl != null).            {.                int rndnum = rndimage.next(0, files.count);.                imglbl.image = files[rndnum];.                lbls.add(imglbl);.                imags.add(imglbl.image);.                ints.add(rndnum);.                files.removeat(rndnum);.            }.        }.    }...i also thought that i had to make 2 other lists for the final assigned images and labels. so i can assign them again in the click event using the ints list as index indicators. i already have a part of my click event:..    private void label_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        label clicklbl = sender as label;..        if (clicklbl != null).        {..        }.    }...my thoughts are that i, somehow, have to check te index of clicklbl in the label list. but i don't know how. i can be completely wrong here but i would like to hear a good method for this. can someone please help me out? i`m really clueless at the moment...these are the steps it should go through:...when the application starts the labels shouldn't have images.when the user clicks the label will show it's image which was assigned in the imgtolbl() method.the image is now visible...note:..i can not use pictureboxes instead of the labels. we have to use labels. otherwise i wouldn't be asking this question"
