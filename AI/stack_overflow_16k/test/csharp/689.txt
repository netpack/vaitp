"format string remove or substring from serial port without exception, how? i'm using this piece of code to receive the weight from scale. ..to the part with .tostring all is good, but when i call .remove(9, 5) it throws me an argumentoutofrangeexception. why? i'm not out of range...private delegate void closure();..private void sport_datareceived2(object sender, serialdatareceivedeventargs serialdatareceivedeventargs).{.    if (invokerequired)     //&lt;-- makes sure the function is invoked to work properly in the ui-thread.        begininvoke(new closure(() =&gt; { sport_datareceived2(sender, serialdatareceivedeventargs); }));     //&lt;-- function invokes itself.    else.    {.        while (sport.bytestoread &gt; 0) //&lt;-- repeats until the in-buffer is empty.        {.            textbox1.text += string.format(""{0:x2} "", sport.readexisting().tostring().remove(9, 5));.            //&lt;-- bytewise adds inbuffer to textbox.        }.    }.}...i also tried with a substring but still got an exception.  ..the whole received string is: ""n00.394kgrns00r""..because of this, i have to use remove or substring, to get what i need exactly - ""00.394kg"" part only."
