"how to show the content of a variable which is in a class library in a form or console? i have a blank solution which contains a project and a class library written by somebody else. the class library gets gps data via wifi. the project shows the processed data on a map. now, i want to see the contents of some variables in the class library in real time for the sake of debugging...i tried to use ..system.diagnostics.debug.write(value) ...without success. it seems it does not do anything. ..also i tried ""messagebox.show(value.tostring())"" which was good but it stopped the wifi reading and interrupted the program as i needed to press ok button each time that it showed up...moreover, i added a windows form (which contained a textbox) to the class library to print the data in the textbox, however, when i wrote:..form1.textbox1.text = value.tostring()...it gives me this error:...  error 3   'mapnmea.form1.textbox1' is inaccessible due to its protection level    c:usersjohndocumentsvisual studio 2010projectsnew ver of map purecommapexplorermapexplorermapnmeamapnmeaserialport.cs    184 27  mapnmea...""mapnmea"" is the name of the class library. also ""mapexplorer"" is the name of both solution and the project. ""serialport.cs"" is a file inside the class library in which i wrote the above code...my question is how to show the content of those variable (they are 3,4 variables) in real time and this act should not stop the wifi reading. i need to do this as an electrician who does not know much about programming wants to check whether a gps device sends the data to my computer correctly or not...update 1: actually i noticed that system.diagnostics.debug.write(value) is working but as there was too many warning messages showing up in the debug window, i did not noticed it. now, if somehow i could remove (or hide) other (warning) messages, i would see only my desired output. do you know?"
