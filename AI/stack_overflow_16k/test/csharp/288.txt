"simple calculator-type program. use of unassigned local variable? i'm only a couple of weeks into programming and thought i'd just have some fun and write a small calculator type console application. but, i seem to have hit a problem that i can't understand. i'm getting an error when trying to run the program that 'answer' is an unassigned local variable, but i'm pretty sure it's not??? it's on the 'answer' in the last console.writeline();..i've double checked everything is spelled the same, including the same case...static void main(string[] args).    {.        int firstnumber, secondnumber, answer;.        string op;..        console.writeline(""please enter a number:"");.        firstnumber = int.parse(console.readline());.        console.writeline(""please enter a second number:"");.        secondnumber = int.parse(console.readline());..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1; i++).        {.            console.writeline(""please choose an op +, -, x, or /"");.            op = console.readline();..            if (op != ""+"" || op != ""-"" || op != ""x"" || op != ""/"").            {.                i += -1;.                console.writeline(""please try again"");.            }.        }..        if (op == ""+"").            answer = firstnumber + secondnumber;.        else if (op == ""-"").            answer = firstnumber - secondnumber;.        else if (op == ""x"").            answer = firstnumber * secondnumber;.        else if (op == ""/"").            answer = firstnumber / secondnumber;.        else.            answer = 0;..        console.writeline(answer);.        console.readline();.    }...edit: the ""please chose an op"" line should have been in the loop. fixed above...the exact error message is now (having moved the above writeline)...  error  1   use of unassigned local variable 'op'...that seems to have replaced the last error message which said the same about 'answer'. 'op' is underlined in the first if statement...the errors appear when i click ""start"" in debug mode in visual studio 2013 express"
