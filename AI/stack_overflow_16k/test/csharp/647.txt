"can't make lock object private in static class - why? in a static class, i have a method which will edit a variable. the class is static because the class is about site detaild and so only one instance is ever required...anyway, thread synchronisation is required. i have a lock object, but when i make it private it and say lock (obj){} i get all sorts of errors...why is not possible to make the lock object private?"
