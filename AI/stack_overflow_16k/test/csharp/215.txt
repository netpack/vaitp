"parsing ""hh:mm:ss"" and ""h:m:s"" times using datetime.parseexact() i want to be able to parse the following times using parseexact() function:..01:02:03.1:02:03.1:2:03.1:02:3.01:2:3.1:2:3...is it possible, or do i need to do my own conversions so it work?..so far i can parse only all with leading 0 or all without leading zero..i can do it with 6 format strings but i think this is pretty stupid."
