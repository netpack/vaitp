reload a web page using blank i have a web page that prompts for user input via dropdownlists in some table cells.  when a selection is made the selection replaces the dropdownlist so that the action can only be performed once.  in the case that a change needs to be made i want to be able to click a button that reloads the page from scratch.  i have googled and googled but i have not managed to find a way to do this...any advice is appreciated...regards.
