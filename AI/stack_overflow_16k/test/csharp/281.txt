"how to get userprincipal from iprincipal in blank asp.net? in blank asp.net, i'm trying to get the current user display name like ""tom jones"" and not ""jones, tom"". i saw this code..userprincipal up = userprincipal.findbyidentity(principalcontext, user.identity.name);...but the problem is that, it looks it up by name, and there could be multiple matches. how can i get it from a unique identifier?..thanks"
