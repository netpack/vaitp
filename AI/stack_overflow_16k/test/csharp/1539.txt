"static readonly field not initialized based on ordering of fields i have a public static class that has a number of static methods and static readonly fields...public static class global.{.    ....    // config is a static method in global..    public static readonly string firebaseauthdomain = config(""firebaseauthdomain""); .    private static readonly string resourcenameformat = ""{0}.{1}"";.    ....}...i get a nullreferenceexception when i access resourcenameformat. however, if i move the declaration of resourcenameformat before firebaseauthdomain as shown below, it works fine...public static class global.{.    ....    private static readonly string resourcenameformat = ""{0}.{1}"";.    // config is a static method in global..    public static readonly string firebaseauthdomain = config(""firebaseauthdomain""); .    ....}...it looks like the call to config() has something to do with this behavior, but i can't tell why. what is the difference between these two code snippets?"
