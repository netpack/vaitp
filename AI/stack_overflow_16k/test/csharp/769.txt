"what is the main purpose of composition in blank? i have read many articles and answers on the internet, all of which say where composition must be used or why composition must be preferred over inheritance. but that is not my question!..what is the main purpose of composition?.for those who say code reuse. i have another question. when inheritance is there to serve the purpose of code reuse, why use composition?..one thing i want to know is that if some ""y"" functionality is also serving the same purpose, then why should i use ""x"". there should be a purpose which is only served by ""x"", and not by any other ""y"". ..so, my question is what is that purpose in this case of composition(x) &amp; inheritance(y)?..i am new in the field, and it would really help if someone answered my question."
