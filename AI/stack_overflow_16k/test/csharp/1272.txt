"find logo for desktop applications using blank good day users..i am working on application which maintains list of other applications (like excel, word, adobe reader, etc.). for each app, i would like to have it's logo to use in listview while displaying whole list. for sure, it will not be possible for all apps (especially for unpopular ones.) but for well known ones.  .logos can be found in google and then manually inserted one by one, but the problem is that, number of apps in the list is more than ten thousand. .using google image search api is not good solution, since it only allows 100 request in a day..if anyone know how to do this, or has any suggestion, please let me know ^^ .thanks"
