"removing the 3rd and 4th character using blank i am trying to delete the 3rd and 4th character from a string from a value from a database which has a serialized data, for below example i need to remove the number 2 and 3, i am using below code to remove the first character from a string, since the replace method needs to find a specific character then replace it with, but below string is unique, i think the method that i am looking for is remove...00230a01e0...removing the first character..string data = '00230a01e0';.data.remove(0,1);...so the final output will look like this..000a01e0"
