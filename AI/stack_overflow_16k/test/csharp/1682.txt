"running cmd opens a duplicate form you are probably confused about the title and me too, this is baffling me. whenever i run the code below to open cmd, run ipconfig and paste it into the textbox, all it does is make a duplicate form appear. why? i have absolutly no idea. i replaced the code with ""textbox1.text = ""hi""; which worked fine so it must be this code..private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.    process p = new process();.    p.startinfo.useshellexecute = false;.    p.startinfo.redirectstandardoutput = true;.    p.startinfo.filename = ""ipconfig.exe"";.    p.start();.    p.waitforexit();.    string output = p.standardoutput.readtoend();.    textbox1.text = output;.}...is it just me doing something stupid, im very tired so it might be..here is a gif of the duplicate form appearing"
