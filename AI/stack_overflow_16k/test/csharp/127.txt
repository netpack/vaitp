"blank print float values with more precision i want to print floats with greater precision than is the default...for example when i print the value of pi from a float i get 6 decimals. but if i copy the same value from the float into a double and print it i get 14 decimals...why do i get more precision when printing the same value but as a double?..how can i get console.writeline() to output more decimals when printing floats without needing to copy it into a double first?..i also tried the 0.0000000000 but it did not write with more precision, it just added more zeroes. :-/..my test code:..float x = (float)math.pi;.double xx = x;.console.writeline(x);.console.writeline(xx);..console.writeline($""{x,18:0.0000000000}""); // try to force more precision .console.writeline($""{xx,18:0.0000000000}"");...output:..3,141593.3,14159274101257.      3,1415930000  &lt;-- the program just added more zeroes :-(.      3,1415927410...i also tried to enter pi at https://www.h-schmidt.net/floatconverter/ieee754.html..the binary float representation of pi is 0b01000000010010010000111111011011..so the value is: 2 * 0b1.10010010000111111011011 = 2 * 1.57079637050628662109375 = 3.1415927410125732421875..so there are more decimals to output. how would i get blank to output this whole value?"
