"assign byte, uint16 and uint32 data types to object data type in blank according to this msdn link, an object data type can point to any data type. however, i get an error while doing so. my code is given below. ..public bool write(object[] data, uint32 numdata).{.   // code.}...the code to test the write api is below:..byte[] writebuffer = new byte[256];.random rnd = new random();.uint32 size = 256;.rnd.nextbytes(writebuffer);.data.write(writebuffer, size);...here, writebuffer is a byte array, but it can also be a uint16 or uint32 array. i get an error in the data.write line that there are invalid arguments...please let me know what the issue is. ..edit 1:.my app provides a ""write"" api that can take a byte, uint16 or uint32 type array. depending on the data type (which is set when the object is created), the api internally converts uint16 and uint32 to a byte array and passes it to the underneath layers. btw, this is .net microframework, where the layers below the api are native c++ code...thanks."
