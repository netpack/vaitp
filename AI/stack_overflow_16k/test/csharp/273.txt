"how do we access static properties in a class since the latter is not an object? i am new to blank and i came across the following query. since a class is not an object but just a blueprint(template), how is it possible to define static members on the class and access them by using the class name? this does not make sense to me. my understanding is class does not exist as an entity, so where static properties live? where am i wrong?"
