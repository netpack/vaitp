"difficulty of switching from html only e-mail to text only e-mail in .net blank? i am working with a consulting group on a program which currently uses a .net blank script to send e-mails in html format at regular intervals...the e-mail itself aside from being in html format although the content is text with some  tags and contains less then a page of text...i would like the consultant to change this to text format replacing the  tags with line feed/carriage returns. i have been told that this is a four hour job but that seems excessive to me...when i look online at a page such as this http://www.mattvanandel.com/771/c-sending-an-email/ it would seem the change could be completed in less than 4 hours including recompiling the .net code into a dll, testing and uploading the code to a server...not all developers are created equal, but assuming that the .net developer is experienced enough to warrant a $250 per hour salary does this seem reasonable? if it is something less than 4 hours (i.e. more like 4 min) can someone tell me what might have to be done to make the modification. from what i can see its likely 2 lines of code that need to be modified (i.e. the body string and the isbodyhtml statement). what else may i be missing?"
