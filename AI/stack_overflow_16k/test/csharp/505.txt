"i don't know how to move around words to reduce the number of lines of a txt file in blank i'm trying to take an xml file that contains a random list of words that has a wrap limit and return the list of words in a txt file in an order which contains as few lines as possible in blank. it also contains a wrap feature so that if word that would be put on the line exceeds the wrap limit, the word is inserted into the next line..i understand the theory to do this: you apply the wrap and then create a new list, go down the list of words and find the first available space in the wrap. you then go down the list of words and if a word's length is less than the available space, designate the word as found. you then find the next space and start again. when there are no more lines, the words are inputted into a new list with the words designated as found going into the spaces that can fit them..for example: the wrap is 8 and the words are: abc tyur yuf oir a gt..the output after the wrap should be:..abc.tyur.yuf oir.a gt...and the final output should be like this..abc yuf.tyur yuf.oir a gt...i have managed to get the wrap working but i cannot figure out how to convert the theory of the line reduction into a method that works. can anyone help?"
