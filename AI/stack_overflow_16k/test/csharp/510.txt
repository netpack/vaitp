"call parent form method when returning to parent form from child form how do i call a method loadgrid located in a parent form frmmain when returning to frmmain from a child form?  ..in frmmain the method loadgrid is run at frmmain load time to populate a data grid view.  a stored procedure is used in loadgrid to pull the certain (not all) records from sql data to populate the dgv.  once frmmain is loaded, it is never loaded again, so loadgrid is never run again and my dgv is never refreshed...i have created a button on frmmain that will run loadgrid.  it works fine, but this takes manual intervention.  ..my child form is used to approve/clear records that are shown on the frmmain dgv.  when returning from the child form, i would like the dgv on frmmain ""refreshed"", but i don't know how to call loadgrid when i return from my child form."
