"error in my code's for loop - the error message states ""input string not in correct format"" //declaring variables.int limit = 10;.double x = 0, total = 0, userinput, final;.string input;.writeline(""enter a number to show multiplication table:  "");.input = readline();.userinput = convert.toint32(input);. //while loop to accept multiple user inputs.for (x = 0; x &lt;= limit; x++).{.    total = x;.    final = userinput * x;.    writeline(""{0} times {1} equals (2}"", userinput, x, final);.}...i have been working on this for a while. what i am trying to accomplish is when a user inputs a number the code will create a multiplication table for numbers 1-10. for example, the code will display 7 time 1 equals 7. i tried to create a for loop to use the writeline statement until x less than or equal to the limit. the x++ statement is meant to add one to x each time the loop is executed. have i misunderstood how for loops work? i have checked through my code for minor syntax error but can not find the solution to this problem. i am sorry if this is not what this site is for as this is my first time posting here. thank you for all of the replies in advance as i am new to programming and appreciate the help."
