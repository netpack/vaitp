"finding the line numbers of all occurences of a string in a text file i'm trying to write a function that does the following:..given a text file, i want to find all occurences of a certain string in this file; then, for each occurence, the line on which it was found should be added to a list. we assume that each line only contains at most one occurence. the text file can get very large, which means a simple for-loop to iterate over each line the file will be too slow...for example, say we have a file with the content:...a b c d e f g.h j k l m n o.g f e d c b a.p q r s t u v...if i were to search for ""a"", the function would find it on lines 1 and 3 and thus add 1 and 3 to a list (and then return the list)...i was considering binary search, but it seems to require that a list to be sorted and the elements to be distinct - i'm looking for identical values...so, is any other search algorithm i can base my function on, with roughly the same performance as binary search?..thanks!"
