"declaring an anonymous tuple with using; is it possible? using coordinate = (int x, int y);...does not compile...using coordinate = system.tuple&lt;int, int&gt;;...does compile...due to reasons i prefer the former; can it be done?..update:..the reason has been questioned and debated so here is why:..i have a small class that works with a tuple. i could write a small tuple class coord{int x; int y;} but decided not to. instead i wrote (int x, int y) everywhere and let the duck typing do its magic. it works alright but in some places impedes readability, possibly because we are trained in reading types as pascalcase and not (pare,the,sised)..so i had the idea that, just like giving the type tuple&lt;int,int&gt;an alias i could give the anonymous type (int x, int y) an alias. then i could use the alias or the anonymous type depending on what i decide is more readable..(my real code is slighly more complicated than x&amp;y)"
