"clear mutiple textboxes by reusing an event handler i have 3 textboxes and i need to clear the text once the text box is clicked..the only thing is that i have to do that by reusing the same event handler. i created the event handler, gave it a general name to fit all, but now i don't know what statement to write inside it. .if i write : txtbox1.clear(); it will only clear that one textbox, but if i write: txtbox1.clear(); txtbox2.clear(); txtbox3.clear(); .it will clear all of them when only one is clicked..in other words, i need it to clear only the text of the textbox that has been clicked, but they all have to be under the same event handler..anything will help! thanks!"
