"casting a system.__comobject in blank via reflection i'm attempting to cast a system.__comobject to an interface type using reflection. i have tried using convert.changetype(object,type) but blank then throws this error:...  system.invalidcastexception: object.  must implement iconvertible....so is there any possible way to cast a general __comobject  using reflection to its correct type so i can then call its methods via reflection? and yes, it has to be done via a method which doesn't involve telling the compiler ahead of time what the object type is!"
