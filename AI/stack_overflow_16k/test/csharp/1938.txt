"split separates strings and ignore/remove other delimited string i'm reading a comma-delimited list of strings from a config file. i need to check the following steps..1) check to see if the string has `[`, if it is then remove or ignore....2) split `,` `-` //which i am doing below......here is what i able to do so far;..string mediastring = ""cnn-[news],msnbc"";..string[] split = mediastring.split(new char[] { ',', '-' }); //gets me the bracket...what i want is to ignore/remove the string which is in the brackets so the end result should be like this:..mediastring = .                cnn.                msnbc"
