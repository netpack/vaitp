"any performance issues with this code this is probably going over the top, but i was after a function that assigns a value to my class property if the value from the database is not null and do nothing if it is. i could do this with if statements but i was after a one liner. i want this to go everywhere in my code but before doing so was just wondering if this is the right way to go about it with performance in mind. thanks...calling code: assign(variable, value)..utils.assign(dataset.tables[0].rows[0][""assigned""], ref this.assigned);...utils functions:..public static void assign(object value, ref boolean variable).{.    if (isrealstring(value)) // check .    {.        switch (isboolean(value.tostring())) { case true: variable = convert.toboolean(value); break; }.    }.}..public static boolean isboolean(string s).{.    boolean bit;.    if (boolean.tryparse(s, out bit)).        return true;.    else.        return false;.}..public static bool isrealstring(object s).{.    return s != null &amp;&amp; !string.isnullorempty(s.tostring());.}"
