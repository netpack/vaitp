"what is dictionary compaction support? ""here is the implementation of the dictionary without any compaction support.""..this quote is taken from here: http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2009/03/03/building-a-weakreference-hashtable.aspx..i know jaredpar is a member on here and posts on the blank section. what exactly is ""dictionary compaction support""? i am assuming it is some way to optimise or make it smaller? but how (if this is what it is)?..thanks"
