"dynamically loading class into interface i'm trying to dynamically load a class, from a dll, at run time then cast it as in interface.  ..i have a class define in a dll called myclass.dll like below...namespace myclass.{.    public class class1 : imyinterface.    {.        public int mynumber { get; set; } = 6;..        public int getmynumber().        {.            return mynumber;.        }.    }.}...then, i have an interface defined in a shared dll like below:..namespace common.{.    public interface imyinterface.    {.        int mynumber { get; set; }..        int getmynumber();.    }.}...finally, i have my code attempted to load the assembly and assign it as a imyinterface...private void form1_load(object sender, eventargs e).        {.            string fname = @""d:developmentresearchdynamic loadmyclassbindebugmyclass.dll"";..            assembly decoupledassembly = assembly.loadfrom(fname);.            if (decoupledassembly != null)  //all good.            {.                type t = decoupledassembly.gettype(""myclass.class1"");.                //good here too, it finds it just fine..                imyinterface mi = (activator.createinstance(t) as imyinterface);.                //now i'm screwed screwed..                if (mi != null).                    messagebox.show(mi.getmynumber().tostring());                    .            }.        }...you can see in the comments where it is breaking.  i find the type, no problem, but returns null when i attempted to cast it as my interface.  ..thanks in advance for your help."
