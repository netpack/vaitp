"blank static vs instance methods i'm risking it this might be a newb question but here goes. i'm tempted to add a method to a class that could possible have thousands and thousands of instances in memory at a given time. now, the other option is creating a static class with a static method, and just create the [static] method there, instead of an instance method in the class. something like so:..this:..public static class petowner.{.    public static void renamepet(pet pet, string newname).    {.        pet.name = newname;.    }.}...instead of this:..public class pet.{.    public string name { get; set; }..    public void rename(string newname).    {.        this.name = newname;.    }.}...i'm just wondering if the static class alternative would take considerably less memory...thanks!"
