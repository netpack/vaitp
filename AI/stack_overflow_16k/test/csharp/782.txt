"detect the blank version at compile time is it possible to detect if the current version of blank is 6 or above with a preprocessor directive, so at compile time?..i want to do something like this:..var myvar = ...;.string name;..#if version_6_or_more.    name = nameof(myvar);.#else.    name = ""myvar"";.#endif...i use visual studio 2015 and blank 6, so i can use nameof(). someone else wanting to compile this code however may be using an older version, where nameof() isn't present. ..i want to use a preprocessor directive so i can keep the nameof() in blank 6, but someone else who doesn't use that version can compile it as well."
