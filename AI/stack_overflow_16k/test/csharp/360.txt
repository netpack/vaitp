how do i start in blank a function that's async from a function that isn't? i have a function that isn't async and as a result i can't use await. in that function i call a function that's async...my coworker suggested i use:..private void foo().{.   var _ = barasync();.}...this way however has the disadvantage that i don't get notified when the function throws errors. is there a better way to call the function? i don't care whether or not the function gets executed asyncronly.
