"blank making private instance variable accesable (jagged array) in a attempt to put some more oop in a program i am looking to make a private instance variable in one class (object) accesable to a class...private byte [][] j;  ..all those code refers to this jagged array with this..now in the other class i putted all the for loops along with the consolewritlines to display the wanted results. basicly it says ""the name j does not exist in the current context"".but how exactly do i make this j accesable?..i have tried with get and set but i keep getting 'cannot convert to byte to byte[][]'..also what kind of cyntax would i need with get and set?..something along like this? or would i need several more steps? :..public byte jarray.get { return j; }  //can converrt to byte here.set { j = value; } //cannnot convert to byte here...kind regards"
