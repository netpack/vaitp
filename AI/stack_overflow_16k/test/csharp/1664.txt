"equivalent of bloch's effective java for blank i've jumped into the blank bandwagon and was wondering if there's an equivalent of joshua bloch's effective java for the blank world. ..i've already being able to apply some java knowledge to blank given their similarity but i'm interested in knowledge to make the most effective use of blank specific features. for example, generics are not implemented equally in java and blank, so it's not clear to me if the java generic ""techniques"" will work in blank as well...i'm mostly interested in blank 3.0. that is (of course) unless you guys think i would benefit for looking into versions 1 and 2 features."
