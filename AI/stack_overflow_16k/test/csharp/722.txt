"is there a one line way i can find the length of the longest of two blank strings? i have two strings as input parameters to a method:..public list&lt;answerrow&gt; makeanswers(string c, string r)...on the first line of my method i have the code to check for a condition where both are null and then do a return:..if (c == null &amp;&amp; r == null).{.    return null;.}...is there a safe (one of the two might be null), one line way that i can find the length of the longest string?..note the return type is used later on in the method after i know the length of the longest string."
