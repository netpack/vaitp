"using ""row.selected = true"" changes appearence but not currentrow index i have the following snippet of code that searches the grid for the desired record and highlights it:..foreach(datagridviewrow row in grdactivejobs.rows).{.    if(row.cells[""part number""].value.tostring() == lvpartnum &amp;&amp; row.cells[""serial number""].value.tostring() == lvserialnum).        row.selected = true;.}...the above code works as intended - the row is highlighted, however, if i run a check on the currentrow.index.. if (grdactivejobs.currentrow.index == 0). {.     // do things. }...it will show the current index as 0 even if the highlighted row found by the previous snippet has an index of 5...my question is, when the ""row.selected = true"" gets set, how can i also make sure that the current row index for the grid is set correctly and isn't detected as 0?..thank you in advance."
