"how can i generate a different image in a visual studio picturebox depending on a listbox? in visual studio, in one of the window forms, i've got a listbox that is retrieving it'information from a data table in sql server. for this data table the primary key is called id. in the same window form i've added a picturebox, where i would like the images to be generated depending on the selection in the listbox. the images are saved in a folder on the project folder...i'm already using a method to populate the listbox so maybe i can use that to determine which image needs to be displayed:.. static sqlcommand com = new sqlcommand(""select *,concat(name,' ',year) as date_bikes from model"", conn);.. sqldataadapter adaptb = new sqldataadapter(com);.. datatable biket = new datatable();..void method1() --this method fills the checkedlistbox.. {.. adaptb.fill(biket);.. bikes.items.clear();.. bikes.datasource = biket;.. bikes.valuemember = ""id"";.. bikes.displaymember = ""namemod"";.. }...private void listbox1_selectedindexchanged(object sender, eventargs e)..    {.        foreach (object itemchecked in listbox1.items).        {.            datarowview casteditem = itemchecked as datarowview;.            string name = casteditem[""namemod""].tostring();.        }.      if (name == ""bike 1"").        {.          picturebox1.image = image.fromflie(""file path"").        }.      else if (name == ""bike 2"").        {.          picturebox1.image = image.fromflie(""file path"").        }.    and so on..."
