"creating wcf service without .svc file i am having issues running few files which contains a wcf service. the service is created without a config file and without a .svc file. is it possible to run a service without a .svc file. these are 2 simple blank class files which have their full service requirements, like service contracts and operation contracts...i have tried it calling from another class, but it gives this error:""a project with an output type of class library cannot be started directly""..my question is: is it necessary to have a service.svc file?"
