"blank: while condition on function with out parameter? i am working with an api that uses functions that use out parameters. i want to use the value in one of these out parameters in a while loop. for example:..static int counter = 0;..static void getcountervalue(out int val).{.    val = counter;.    counter++;.}..static void main().{.    // right now, i'm having to do this:.    int checkval = 0; // i have to figure out an appropriate starting value..    while (checkval &lt; 10) .    {.        getcountervalue(out checkval);.        console.writeline(""still waiting."");.    }.    console.writeline(""done."");.}...is there a simpler syntax to do this? i want something more classic like while (getcountervalue() &lt; 10), but i have to deal with the out parameters because it's an api that i can't change."
