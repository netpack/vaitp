"how to convert list to dictionary using key but do not include key as element i've got the following linq query which works fine:..var jsonstring = jsonconvert.serializeobject(this.documenttypes.select(c =&gt; new.{.    rowid = c.rowid,.    id = c.id,.    isdocumenttype = c.isdocumenttype.}).todictionary(x =&gt; x.rowid));...and as you can see, i'm setting my dictionary's key to the rowid but i can only get this to work if i include the rowid as an element that is returned. ..is there a way to achieve the same result without having to include the rowid as a returned element?..thanks."
