cannot assign to .. because it is a group method i am using moq to write test cases and when i try to assign the mock function within the constructor it comes up with the error saying that i cannot assign it because the target method is a group method however there is only one method defined...i have written an interface etc. as follows:.......public interface irspportal.{.    string getorderstatus(orderinfo ordernum);.}..public class rspportal : irspportal.{..    public rspportal(irspportal getorderstatusmock).    {.        this.getorderstatus = getorderstatusmock; //this line gives the error.    }..    public string getorderstatus(orderinfo ordernum).    {.         //stuff done here to access a database.    }.}........there is only one method getorderstatus(orderinfo ordernum) so i don't know why it has classified it as a method group. what is the simplest way to overcome this error?..i have tried to use .this.getorderstatus = getorderstatusmock.getorderstatus;.but that didn't work either...thanks everyone.
