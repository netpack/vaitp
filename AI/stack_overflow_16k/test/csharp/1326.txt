"passing variable double[] i have the following code:..protected void btn1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.double[] value1 = {1010,2010,3010,4010,5010};.double[] value2 = {1020,2020,3020,4020,5020};.}.protected void btn2_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.double begin = math.round(value1.min() / 100d, 0) * 100;.double end = math.round(value1.max() / 100d, 0) * 100;.//then some more math happens using value1 and value1.}...how do i declare the double[] so that it can pass it between the event hander, so basically btn1_click assign a some values to value1 and value2 and btn2_click uses value1 and value2 for some calculations"
