"how to destroy a static class in blank i am using .net 1.1. i have a session class in which i have stored many static variables that hold some data to be used by many classes...i want to find a simple way of destroying this class instead of resetting every variable one by one. for example if there is a static class mystatic, i would have liked to destroy/remove this class from the memory by writing mystatic = null, which is not currently possible,..additional question...the idea of singleton is good, but i have the following questions:..if singleton is implemented, the 'single' object will still remain in the memory. in singleton, we are only checking if an instance is already existing. how can i make sure that this instance variable also gets destroyed. ..i have a main class which initializes the variable in the static class. even if i plan to implement a rest() method, i need to call it from a method, for eg, the destructor in the main class. but this destructor gets called only when gc collects this main class object in the memory, which means the reset() gets called very late..thanks.pradeep"
