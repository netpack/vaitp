blank task repeat every x count there are currently many solutions on stackoverflow using blank task to repeatedly do some work every x time interval. i would like to do it repeatedly to say every 100 counts of a counter. this counter is not time-based but is actually a number of values stored into an array for example. is there any tutorial which could give an idea on how to implement this?
