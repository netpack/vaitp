"is it bad practice to have a constructor with entirely optional parameters? while designing a class structure for a blank project, i thought about an interesting question that i was hoping to get some insight on before finalizing my design. here's a template design of the concept i'm talking about:..class templateclass.{.    public templateclass(int input1 = 0, string input2 = """").    {.        field1 = input1;.        field2 = input2;.    }.    public templateclass().    {.        field1 = 0;.        field2 = """";.    }.    public int field1;.    public string field2;.}...it seems like an incredibly convenient design for the purpose of what i'm doing, but i'm curious if this is considered bad practice for any reason."
