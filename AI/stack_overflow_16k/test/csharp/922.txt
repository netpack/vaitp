"blank file from streamreader split into int and string by space. after first line so what i'm trying to do is read a text file that will have just a month on the first line, every line after having a year space then month...in the example the first line says march which i need to be able to save to compare to the rest of the months, so i need to split every line after march by space only. ..readcontents = streamreader.readtoend();.            string[] lines = readcontents.split('r');...ive been playing around with variations of this code with no success, any help is appreciated.....added an img of the text file but heres also what it would say .incase the formate changes, the first line says march, every line after starts with a year then a space then a month, one perline....march.1998    january.2010    october.1990    november.0"
