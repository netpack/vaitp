"unknown constant scalabilitytesting i have some strange code in a web service...#if scalabilitytesting.random r = new random();.#endif...i've done a few searches on google but found nothing useful. the web service is written in blank. the project it is in, has microsoft unit tests...obviously, it's saying if this variable is  true then create a new random number, and my guess is that when i run the microsoft unit tests then this is triggered...i've not seen anything like this before so i'd like to know what it is...the only other clue i have is the following bit of code, which is at the very top of the page...//#define scalabilitytesting.#define soapsecurity.#define softwarefeatures...visual studio highlights #define...i don't know if the stackoverflow question below is related and my guess is that this is something similar to the debug and trace constants...define new compile-time constant in blank (for #if)..edit.i've found these links which seem related..http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yt3yck0x.aspx.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4y6tbswk.aspx"
