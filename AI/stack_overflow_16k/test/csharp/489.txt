"blank active program identification i am currently working on a programmable keyboard, based on an arduino. the blank program gets the information which key is pressed via usb. until now i am able to open programs, using shortcuts, .....as an addition i want to have different key-bindings for different programs..to get this working i have to get a specific detail from the active program, like the name of the exe file...while searching i have found out, that i can get the active window with the getactivewindow function and i know, that i have to use another windows function, but i haven't found out which one...i was able to get the header text of the window, but this text was for example different for each open word document, so i couldn't use this...anyone have a clue which function i can use, to get something specific to compare with an if statement, like this:..string activeprogram;.....if(activeprogram==""word""){...}.else if(activeprogram==""chrome""){...}"
