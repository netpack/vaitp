"why am i receiving a ""call is ambigious"" error when trying to user math.floor with an integer? i've just made a small program that uses the floor method:..public static void main(string[] args).    {..        int i;..        decimal[] t = new decimal[30];..        for(i=0; i&lt;t.length; i++).        {.            t[i]=math.floor(i/6);.        }..        for(i=0; i&lt;t.length; i++).        {.            console.writeline(""""+t[i]);.        }..        console.readkey(true);.    }...but it doesn't work. sharpdevelop returns this error:...  the call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'system.math.floor(decimal)' and 'system.math.floor(double)' (cs0121)...which is related to this line:..t[i] = math.floor(i/6);...could someone explain me what's wrong?..also: at first i tried writing int[] t = new int[30]; since my program only returns integers. but it returned a second error, saying that i should use the type decimal instead of the type int. i also tried to use the type float and the type double but it didn't work either. it seems only the type decimal works. i would also like to know why?"
