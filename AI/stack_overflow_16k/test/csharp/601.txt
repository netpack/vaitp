"file appending with binarywriter i have written a simple utility function to gather a bunch of text, so that after a few rounds, i can open the text file and see the content...public static void accumulate(string text, string path).{.    var file = file.open(path, filemode.append);..    using ( var binary = new binarywriter(file) ).    {.        binary.write(text);.        file.close();.    }.}...however, when i use a delimiter to separate the output of each run, it does not take effect. for example, i changed the writer line to binary.write(text + ""n""); and then binary.write(text , ""n""); and also tried:..binary.write(text);.binary.write(""n"");.file.close();...but none actually works, which is probably because this is a binary writer, and not a literal text writer. correct?..is there anyway to modify this very program and add a new blank line in between the outputs; i.e. jump to the next line after every writing?..also, i wonder if i should use file.flush() instead of file.close() or perhaps both? which one would ensure proper disposing after writing?"
