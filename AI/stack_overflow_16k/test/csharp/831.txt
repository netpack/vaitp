"extemporaneous access to the result of a method i need callermethod() to access a value found in calledmethod(). .string s is the result of the execution of other methods that are executed independently before..the callermethod() method is not tied to the execution of calledmethod()..the callermethod() and calledmethod() methods belong to two different projects. it doesn't seem right to create a static class to store this value. what do you think is the best way?.the projects are windows form...public void previousmethod().{.    calledmethod(a);.}..public void calledmethod(string value).{.    string s = value;.}..public void callermethod().{.    string getstringsfromcalledmethod = ""?"";.}"
