"how to access clipboard from system.timers.timer i'm trying to capture a screenshot from my application and set it as the picturebox.image when a certain condition is true at a certain point of time. this condition has to be checked repeatedly..for checking this condition, i am using a system.timers.timer. but clipboard.getimage() isn't working. ..i have tried the following code, but that's not working...timer = new system.timers.timer();.timer.interval = 10000; //i'm checking the condition every 10 second or so.timer.elapsed += ontimedevent;.timer.autoreset = true;.timer.enabled = true;...void ontimedevent(object source, system.timers.elapsedeventargs e).{.            if(mycondition==true).               getscreenshot();.}...void getscreenshot().{.            try.            {.                sendkeys.sendwait(""{prtsc}"");.                thread.sleep(500);..                var image = clipboard.getimage();..                picturebox1.image = image;.            }.            catch (exception ex).            {.                messagebox.show(ex.message.tostring());.            }.}...this doesn't work and if i try to save the image then it gives object reference not set kind of exception...i've read somewhere that it happens due to the timer being mta , so it can't get access to clipboard. i have tried using system.windows.forms.timer, but that slows the program down due to the continuous check i guess. ..is there any simple way i can get it to work without slowing down the performance..i'm quite new to blank, so a little description of how a certain solution works will be very helpful."
