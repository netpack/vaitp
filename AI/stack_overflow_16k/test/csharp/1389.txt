"how do i include my assemblies for a project template when packaged in a vsix i have a project template that builds a windows forms application. the windows forms application must have a reference to an assembly that i have also built...when i package the project template in a vsix (or just build it and put it in the templates folder), the project does not have a reference to the assembly. how can i package the assembly in the vsix? ideally i'd like to install it in the gac but i know this is not possible - is there any way for me to create a folder in the project with a name like 'dependencies' and include my assembly there? and how can i do this?..thanks in advance!"
