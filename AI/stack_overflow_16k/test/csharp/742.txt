"switch source method for object created in using block i have a process that is to be used to load data from various sources to a sql server database. within the process, i have several methods that each consume file data and return a datatable object. depending on the type of data to be loaded, one of these methods is called for any single run of the process. ..all of the datatable objects created by these methods are consumed by the same target method, which transfers the data to sql server. this has led to some duplication of code:..if (usedt == 1).        {.            using (datatable dt = makedt1()).            {.                consumedt(dt);.            }.        }..        if (usedt == 2).        {.            using (datatable dt = makedt2()).            {.                consumedt(dt);.            }.        }...(simplified for clarity, real world names are descriptive)..i'd like to avoid this if at all possible. is it possible to pre-calculate the correct method to call to generate the datatable, then call consumedt(dt) just once? e.g. .. switch (usedt).            {.                case 1.                    dtcall = makedt1().                    break;..                case 2.                    dtcall = makedt2().            }..            using (datatable dt = dtcall).            //etc...thanks in advance, iain"
