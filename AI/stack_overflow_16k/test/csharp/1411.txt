"what is the correct way of stopping an object in a method that was created in another? i have a form that has a button which creates a new object and calls it's start() method...the program works fine, however, i now want to create a stop button. i obviously cannot call the object's stop() method as it is elsewhere, but, i just can't think of the correct way of changing my code...as i write this, the best thing i can think of is to take the myobject myo = new myobject(""test""); and place myobject myo; at the top of the class, outside methods and then try to set it from within the class...what would you do in this situation?"
