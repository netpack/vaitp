"how can i make it so my class variables can only be set to one of three choices? i have a class like this:..public class meta.{.    public string height { get; set; }.}...i would like to add some things to the class but i'm not sure how to do it. what i would like is for the height to only be able to be set to either ""tall"" or ""short"". maybe more things in the future but for now it would be a choice just between those two. also i would like it to default to ""short"" in the constructor. i think i would need to use an enums but i am not sure how to.do this...could someone explain. i would very much appreciate."
