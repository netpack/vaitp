"can you have an if statement with in a class? hey i am relatively new to c sharp and coding and i am trying to create a class which i can call and print out later. the class i am trying to create contains a simple if statement such as if your car gives off so much emissions you pay a certain price. my problem is a cant quite be able to create an if in a class and then call it later. is this possible if not any help is much appreciated .. public double emissions;. public double cartax;.. public double ifcartax(double emissions).        {.            cartax = if (emissions == 0).            {.                console.writeline(""car tax is 120"");.            }.            else if (emissions &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; emissions &lt;= 80).            {.                console.writeline(""car tax is 170"");.            }.            else if (emissions &gt;= 81 &amp;&amp; emissions &lt;= 100).            {.                console.writeline(""car tax is 180"");.            }.            else if (emissions &gt;= 101 &amp;&amp; emissions &lt;= 110).            {.                console.writeline(""car tax is 190"");.            }.            else if (emissions &gt;= 111 &amp;&amp; emissions &lt;= 120).            {.                console.writeline(""car tax is 200"");.            }.            else if (emissions &gt;= 121 &amp;&amp; emissions &lt;= 130).            {.                console.writeline(""car tax is 270"");.            }.            else    //catch invalid input.            {.                console.writeline(""invalid co2 emissions"");.            }..        }..        public double getcartax().        {.            return ifcartax;.        }"
