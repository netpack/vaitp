"chat client example gives error ""object reference not set to an instance of an object."" i am trying to write a simple chat client and server program, using this link - http://csharp.net-informations.com/communications/csharp-chat-server-programming.htm (2 links to source code for server and client are just under the pictures). but when i try to compile i get an error in this line ..serverstream.write(outstream, 0, outstream.length);...here i get below error...  nullrefrenceexception [object reference not set to an instance of an object]....but right above i have a line..byte[] outstream = system.text.encoding.ascii.getbytes(textbox2.text);...which successfully initializes the outstream. so i'm really not sure of what is causing this, and will be glad if someone could help me."
