how to select one of two namespaces with the same name i've a solution with a project named shared and another project named foo1...in foo1 i've created a folder also named shared so i've two namespaces named shared in the solution...i've added a reference of the project shared in the project foo1..but now when i type using in a file in foo1 intellisense don't show the shared namespaces...how can i specify in a file that i want to use the shared namespace from shared project in foo1?..note: the file where i want to use the share namespace is in the root of the project (i mean outside the shared folder)
