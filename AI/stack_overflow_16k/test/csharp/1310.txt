using struct as data model in a blank winform client application i am really skeptical on using struct as the data model through out our blank winform client application. but my colleague insist there should not be a problem if we wrap those structs in classes so they will pass by reference. is he right we should keep using struct? or could you help point out problems about using struct in a blank winform client?..the reason of using structs is because we receive data from network in byte stream format. his point is if marshall the bytes stream into a struct is the fastest way. i suggest to use bitconvert to convert each values into class members.
