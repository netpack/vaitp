"using ""if"" statement to remove min/max user input data i'm new to blank, well, coding in general..i have done fairly well by myself to date, in this introduction course i am taking, but i ran into a road bump...i am trying to figure out how to code a if statement that will run inside a loop to analyze 5 different ints as they are entered and to put the max int and min int seperatly so that i can ue the remaining three ints to make a calculation..to be exact, validate user input and remove the min/max user input to average the remaining three...ps, i tried an array but for some reason it wasn't working well.  i don't have the code as i'm at work right now though.  i was told in a lecture that an if statement should be used but arrays are possible too...thank you for your time and any possible answers...using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;..namespace consoleapplication1.{.    class program.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            string userisfinished = """";.            string name, city, value;.            double rating, avg = 0;.            double[] array1 = new double[5];.            double max = 0;.            double min = double.maxvalue;.            double score, totalscore = 0;...            //get basic information.            do.            {.                console.writeline(""please enter divers name."");.                name = console.readline();.                console.writeline(""please enter the divers city."");.                city = console.readline();....                //get and validate user input for 1 dive rating.                console.writeline(""please enter a dive rating between 1.00 and 1.67."");.                rating = double.parse(console.readline());.                while (rating &lt; 1 || rating &gt; 1.69).                {.                    console.writeline(""oops, you entered an invalid number. please, enter a dive rating between 1.00 and 1.67."");.                    rating = double.parse(console.readline());.                }.                console.readline();..                // get and validate user input for 5 judge scores.                for (int s = 1; s &lt;= 5; s++).                {.                    console.writeline(""please enter the score for judge {0}."", s);.                    value = console.readline();.                    score = convert.todouble(value);.                    while (score &lt; 0 || score &gt; 10).                    {.                        console.writeline(""invalid entry, please enter a number in between 0 - 10."");.                        score = convert.todouble(console.readline());.                    }.                    array1[s] = convert.todouble(score);     //----this line keeps throwing an exception.                }.                console.readline();..                //calculate totalscore by dropping min/max scores and averaging them times dive rating.                foreach (int i in array1).                {.                    if (i &gt; max).                        max = i;.                    if (i &lt; min).                        min = i;.                    avg += i;.                }.                totalscore = avg * rating;..                //print gathered and calculated information.                console.writeline(""divers name: {0}"", name);.                console.writeline(""divers city: {0}"", city);.                console.writeline(""dive degree of difficulty: {0}"", rating);.                console.writeline(""total dive score is: {0}"", totalscore);..                // ask if user wants to process another diver and continue or exit program.                console.writeline(""would you like to enter another divers information?
