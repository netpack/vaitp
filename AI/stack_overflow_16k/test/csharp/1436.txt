"blank changing value in dll.config isnt changing at runtime i have configured a boolean variable in project's settings file.when i compile, in my output folder i see the variable in the .dll.config, as follows:..      &lt;setting name=""showstats"" serializeas=""string""&gt;.            &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;.      &lt;/setting&gt;...in code i refer to it by properties.settings.default.showstats.i want to be able to change my .config file and write there false or true, and to have this value reflected in runtime..it seems that only changing it from my settings window in visual studio will work in runtime..changing with notepad isnt working. it will always be the last value set in vs settings window...what am i doing wrong here?"
