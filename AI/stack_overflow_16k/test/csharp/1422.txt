"blank udp socket not receiving entire message i have the following method which sends an rcon command to a game server...public string sendcommand(string command).{.byte[] buffertemp = encoding.ascii.getbytes(command);.byte[] buffersend = new byte[buffertemp.length + 4];..//big enough to receive response.byte[] bufferrec = new byte[65000];..//intial 4 characters as per standard.buffersend[0] = byte.parse(""255"");.buffersend[1] = byte.parse(""255"");.buffersend[2] = byte.parse(""255"");.buffersend[3] = byte.parse(""255"");.int j = 4;..for (int i = 0; i &lt; buffertemp.length; i++).{.    buffersend[j++] = buffertemp[i];.}..//send rcon command and get response.try.{.    this.server.socket.send(buffersend, socketflags.none);.    this.server.socket.receive(bufferrec);.}.catch (socketexception e).{.    messagebox.show(e.tostring(), ""error occured"");.}..string response = encoding.ascii.getstring(bufferrec);..return response;.}...out of all the commands i can possibly send, 1 of them returns a lot more data than the others and it seems that the *buffer_rec* byte array only gets about 1/4 of the message, but that array has been declared big enough to contain all the data..on the subsequent 3 requests, the rest of the data gets output, as if it was buffered in some way...i don't know why this is taking place. if you do, could you please let me know how to remedy the problem?..thank you.crouz"
