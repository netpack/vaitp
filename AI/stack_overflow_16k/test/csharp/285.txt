what is the best approach to follow on executing code again when there's some exception? i am developing one application and in that i need to consume rest api which has token associated with it. after specific interval that token get's expired so in that case suppose if i try to call that api it's throwing exception. so to resolve this should i refresh the token in catch block and use goto to execute the try block again. i read couple of articles and most of them suggest to avoid using goto...below are the links which i refer for best approach to follow but still am not convinced whether to go with it or not:..1> is it possible to execute the code in the try block again after an exception in caught in catch block?..2> https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/abhinaba/2005/10/01/c-try-and-retry/
