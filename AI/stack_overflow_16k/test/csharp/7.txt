"blank managed dll call or unmanaged dll call? i was asking to do two dll calls from our application. these two dlls are from other group and other company. have read a little about managed and unmanaged. i would prefer to do managed call. but whether use managed or unmanaged is the decision of the caller only or it also depends on the callee? all dlls can be called with managed code? if callee is also a factor, how can i know this dll can be called with managed code?"
