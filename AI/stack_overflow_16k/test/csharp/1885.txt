"and a mask to address (lower bits needed) blank so i know i can bit shift a mask of 0xffffffff by say 8 for example to get 0xffffff00 &amp; it with an address and get everything but the last 8 bits, but i would like to go the other way so i can grab the bottom end of an address with a mask like 0x000000ff, however bit shifting right wont work obviously. any ideas? ..here is the code for the first type bit shift i mentioned...public int block_tag(int address, int block_size, int max_address).    {.        int bit_shift = (int)math.log(block_size, 2);.        int bit_mask = max_address &lt;&lt; bit_shift;.        return (address &amp; bit_mask);.    }...i could do it by hand with about 12 ""if"" statements but that isn't very clean. ..thanks!"
