blank how to declare a reference variable to store the address of an object i just need a basic understanding of reference variables as i am in a basic class.  my professor wants us to declare a reference variable to store the address of an object and i don't know how to do that or really what that even does.  ..he did teach us how to do something like this...    public double method(ref name)...but i don't get how that's supposed to store the 'address' of the object...any explanation is greatly appreciated.
