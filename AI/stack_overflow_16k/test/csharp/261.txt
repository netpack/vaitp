"clever way to add ""and* when i concatenate two string variable that may be empty i have a code doing this :..if (isnewname()).    name = ""newname"";.if (isnewlove()).    love = ""newlove"";..//generate output message.if (isnewname() &amp;&amp; isnewlove).    result = ""name and love are updated"".else if (isnewname()).    result = ""name is updated"";.else if (isnewlove()).    result = ""love is updated"";...i was wondering if there is a little trick that would let me generate the result message in one line, or in a more beautiful way...nb. i'm aware that it is completely useless, that it might affect readability,i'm not looking for a good practice but just for the best trick to make this with as less line as possible."
