"without private constructor we can access static member from one to other class? use of private constructor :. it cant able to create instance,. it cant be inherit,. it contain only static data members..without  private constructor also i can able to access class with its static declaration and static data member when assign value like the below example ..class test.{        .    public static int x = 12;.    public static int method().    {.        return 13;.    }.}.class program.{.    int resut1 = test.x;.    int resut2 = test.method();.    static void main(string[] args).    {.    }.}...so i have doubts as below. why should go to private constructor. what is the use of private constructor block. is we cant do anything inside of private constructor block. when it execute please explain clearly..thanks in advance"
