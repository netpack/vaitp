"load custom configuration sections from assembly in different folder i have a blank application to load custom configuration section from assembly in different folder...for example:..appbase: c:code..assembly folder: c:libmy.core.dll..i have error says ""system can't find specific file"". i understand it is caused by different folder. can i reference it in absolute path?..here is my config file:..&lt;section name=""regional"" type=""my.core.regionalsection, my.core"" /&gt;...can i make it something like..&lt;section name=""regional"" type=""my.core.regionalsection, c:libmy.core"" /&gt;"
