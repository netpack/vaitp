"keeping track of user customization's blank good evening; i have an application that has a drop down list; this drop down list is meant to be a list of commonly visited websites which can be altered by the user..my question is how can i store these values in such a manor that would allow the users to change it..example; i as the user, decide i want google to be my first website, and youtube to be my second. ..i have considered making a ""settings"" file however is it practical to put 20+ websites into a settings file and then load them at startup? or a local database, but this may be overkill for the simple need...please point me in the right direction."
