"blank how to detect if an external application has popped up a window? i keep getting multiple verification prompt from a 3rd party application where on many instances i have to select the prompt window, type my password and click on ok. i thought of writing a simple application in white framework which can capture the window, enter my password and deliver a click automatically. ..i need to detect whenever a new window has popped up in windows environment. i don't want to use either a timer or a loop. can i get an event when ever a new window appears (registers) ?..-- regards.akshay mishra"
