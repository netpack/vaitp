"'does not implement interface member' error i'm fairly new to blank so i'm still getting used to it. ..i've had this code going where i want to control a character with a virtual joystick. i was testing whether the joystick would be responsive or now, but every time i try to play the scene, i get 3 cs0535 errors saying: ...  'virtualjoystick' does not implement interface member unityengine.eventsystems.ipointeruphandler.onpointerup(unityengine.eventsystems.pointereventdata)'.  .  'virtualjoystick' does not implement interface member unityengine.eventsystems.idraghandler.ondrag(unityengine.eventsystems.pointereventdata)'.  .  'virtualjoystick' does not implement interface member `unityengine.eventsystems.ipointerdownhandler.onpointerdown(unityengine.eventsystems.pointereventdata)'...here's the code. it's fairly short...using unityengine;.using unityengine.ui;.using unityengine.eventsystems;.using system.collections;..public class virtualjoystick : monobehaviour, idraghandler, ipointeruphandler, ipointerdownhandler.{..private image bgimg;.private image joystickimg;.private vector3 inputvector;..private void start().{.bgimg = getcomponent&lt;image&gt;();.joystickimg = transform.getchild(0).getcomponent&lt;image&gt;();.}..public virtual void ondrag(pointereventdata ped).{.vector2 pos;.if(recttransformutility.screenpointtolocalpointinrectangle(bgimg.recttransform, ped.position, ped.presseventcamera, out pos)).{.debug.log(""test""); .}.}..public virtual void onpointerdown(pointereventdata ped).{.ondrag(ped);.}..public virtual void onpointerup(pointereventdata ped).{..}..}...i hope you guys could help me through this...edit:..i have corrected the syntax, which was cause of why the scene was not playing. but the debug.log on ondrag  code is not working. i'm getting this nullreferenceexception: object reference not set to an instance of an object error. again, i'm just following what the video says, and his seems to work just fine."
