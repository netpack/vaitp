static/non static classes and methods lets assume i got this class:..public class utlities.{.   int age;..   public static void dosomething().   {.       age ++;.   }.}...my questions to this:...does anyone from outside - can access dosomething() in same time? - assuming yes.if answer on 1. is yes then if couple classes executing this method the value will be changing without any problems?.class is non static but method is static so is the method only accessible one time in specific time?.what in case i have couple instance of that class if other classes will access specific instance of class utilities true is that dosomething method will be shared/the same across all instances of class utilites or for each instance of utilities class other outside classes will be accessing different dosomethingmethods?...lets take another example:..public class utlities..    {.       static int age; // &lt;------------------------------------..       public static void dosomething().       {.           age ++;.       }.    }...how it will be in this case?..and last:..public static class utlities  //&lt;-------------static now.{.   static static int age;..   public static void dosomething().   {.       age ++;.   }.}...as class is static now all inside have to be static - does it mean that only one outside class can access it in same time?..last questions as i want to create some help class which inside i would have common methods that could be useful in my program should i use static class with static methods or non static class with static methods - please of explanation here as well.
