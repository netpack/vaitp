"checking if object is null and access members in the same if i am refractoring a line of code from .net 4.0 to 3.5, the actual code is ..if(bar?.foo == ""outdated"").    bar = new bar();...can i refractor these lines in this way and retain the same logic?..if(bar == null || bar.foo == ""outdated"").    bar = new bar();...does the if evaluation stop after the the bar == null (since the expression would be true, no matter whether the other part returns true or false) or does it continue to check bar.foo even if the first part already returned true, and therefore throw a null exception?"
