"date format issue between in app and windows with blank i want to convert a string to datatime. here is my code:..datetime? dt = null;.dt = datetime.parse(postdate[i]);...it works only for dd/mm/yyyy, not work for mm/dd/yyyy because on my computer the date format is set as dd/mm/yyyy in control panel...so if i want to use the application always accept valid format mm/dd/yyyy, no matter the windows date format setting is. how to implement this in blank code?"
