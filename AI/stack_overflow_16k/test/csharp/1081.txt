"mediaplayer ""mediaended"" not called if playback is started from a task continuing previous related thread, i would like to restructure my question a bit. i still cannot receive mediaended event of a mediaplayer class in case it is invoked from a task as described below. more deeply, i have a class library named audio which is a sort of building block (i really prefer not having tasks there, just simple methods doing a functionality)..public class audio.{.    private mediaplayer mediaplayer = null;.    public delegate void audiodelegate();.    public event audiodelegate playbackended;..    public void playaudiofileinmediaplayer(string pathtowavfile).    {.        mediaplayer = new mediaplayer();.        mediaplayer.mediaended += m_mediaended;.        mediaplayer.open(new uri(pathtowavfile));.        mediaplayer.play();.    }..    void m_mediaended(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        mediaplayer mediaplayer = (mediaplayer)sender;.        mediaplayer.close();.        playbackended.invoke();.    }.}...on top of that i have a simple business logic layer bll which calls that audio class method. the bll method must return a task (it is derived from an abstract base class not mentioned here for simplifying and also becasue some other methods in the audio class may be cpu intensive...public class bll.{.    taskcompletionsource&lt;bool&gt; tcs = new taskcompletionsource&lt;bool&gt;();..    public task playaudio(string file).    {.        audio a = new audio();.        a.playbackended += a_playbackended;.        task.factory.startnew(() =&gt;.            {.                a.playaudiofileinmediaplayer(file);.            });.        return tcs.task;.    }..    void a_playbackended().    {.        tcs.trysetresult(true);.    }.}...on top of the bll, we have the gui calling the bll...public partial class form1 : form.{.    bll bll = new bll();..    public form1().    {.        initializecomponent();.    }..    private async void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        await bll.playaudio(@""c:files1.wav"");.    }.}...still, the mediaended event on the audio class is not called... how come??"
