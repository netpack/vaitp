"list holding references i have a list (in blank) of an object (class that i created). i am able to use the list but the problem is that i only created (instantiated i think is the proper term) one of my object class and i keeping adding it to the list even though the properties of that object change with iterations of the code. i would like to be able to add hardcoded objects to my list and not the reference object...here is what i am currently doing:..public class savedata.{.    public double save_property1;.    public double save_property2;    .}..in the application..savedata newsavedata = new savedata();.list&lt;savedata&gt; newsavedatalist = new list&lt;savedata&gt;;..if ( some condition).{.    newsavedata.save_property1 = x.}..if (some condition 2) .{.    newsavedata.save_property2 = y .    newsavedatalist.add(savedata);  // .}...since x and y change over the iterations, i want the savedate object i add to the list not to change with each iteration (so i can keep a history of the data objects), i.e. hardcode and not use as reference."
