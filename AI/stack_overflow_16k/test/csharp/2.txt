"file watcher class with drop box i'm trying to write a small utility service that will detect when a item(s) has been added to a synced drop box folder and then wait (to allow full sync) and move item(s) into a date stamped staging folder for further processing.  simple enough ... ..here is my code: ..    static void main(string[] args).    {.        var watcher = new filesystemwatcher();..        string _path = @""e:importdropbox"";.        watcher.path = _path;.        watcher.enableraisingevents = true;.        watcher.created += new filesystemeventhandler(watcher_created);...        console.         .writeline(""filesystemwatcher ready and listening to changes in :nn"" .                    + _path);..        watcher.path = _path;.        console.readline();.    }..    static void watcher_created(object sender, filesystemeventargs e).    {.        thread.sleep(3000);.        console.writeline(e.name + "" file has been created."");..        string filename = path.getfilename(e.fullpath);.        string path = @""e:importstaging"" .                      + datetime.now.tofiletime().tostring() .                      + @"""";..        try .        { .          directory.createdirectory(path); .        } .        catch(exception ex) .        { .          console.writeline(""error: "" + ex.tostring()); .        }.        try .        { .          file.move(e.fullpath, path + filename); .        } .        catch(exception ex) .        { .          console.writeline(""error: "" + ex.tostring());.        }.    }...this code would work fine if one item was being added to the synced directory, however multiple items will be added and there needs to be a delay for items to be added to the dropbox.  any ideas on how i can accomplish this ?"
