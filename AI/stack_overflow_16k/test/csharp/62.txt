sequential const field values i have classes like this..class myclass{.    const int item1 = 1;.    const int item2 = 2;.    const int item3 = 3;.    ....}.class mysecondclass : myclass.{.    const int item1 = 4;.    const int item2 = 5;.    const int item3 = 6;.    ....}...is there an automatic way to set these values making sure they are sequential and still const? we have had problems on merges where two developers add an item and we end up with two items with the same value...currently we check if this happens with unit tests and fix it if a test breaks. but it would be better we could do something like this during compilation:..int i=0;.class myclass{.    const int item1 = i;.    const int item2 = ++i;.    const int item3 = ++i;.    ....}.class mysecondclass : myclass{.    const int item4 = ++i;.    const int item5 = ++i;.    const int item6 = ++i;.    ....}...edit:.this is legacy code in dozens of classes i can't change the structure to an enum.
