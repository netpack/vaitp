"overwriting console line with various length texts i'm trying to display percentages of loading in the same place..and i found solution on that..console.write($""r{ (double) (i+1) * 100 / list.count }% - {text}"");...but after the percentage i'd want to display some text which has different lengths e.g something between 20-40 characters..the problem with this approach is that if ""new"" line is shorter than ""previous"" then some part of ""previous"" text still remains there...i managed to write 'hack' which overwrites current line with spaces (clears it) and then writes my line..console.write($""r                                                                                                             "");.console.write($""r{ (double) (i+1) * 100 / list.count }% - {text}"");...is there an better solution to do that?"
