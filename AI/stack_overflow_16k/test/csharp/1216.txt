"continue processing job after user exits i am developing a mvc application that has a long running job that processes customer accounts. i would like this process to be able to fire and forget, meaning the user can click ""start"" and then exit the application. this job would continue to process accounts and keep track of its progress (within the application or log file or database updates). the user can then log back in and see the progress at any point. ..i have been attempting to research this and backgroundworker seems to be what i want to do but i am unsure if it will continue once the user ends the sessions (logs off). ..will backgroundworker continue to process the request after the user logs off or will the process end once the user ends the session?"
