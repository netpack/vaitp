"how to know which constructor was called to create an object instance i would like to know if it is possible to know which constructor has been called to create an instance of an object..for example:..public class dog.{.    public string name;.    public int age;..    public dog(){}..    public dog(string n, int age).    {.        this.name = n;.        this.age = age;.    }..    public dog(string n).    {.        this.name = n;.    }    .}...now i create a class instance:..var dog = new dog(""pippo"", 10);...now (i think with reflection) i want to know from ""var dog"" which constructor i have used to create a dog instance if the class has more then one, is it possible?..thanks."
