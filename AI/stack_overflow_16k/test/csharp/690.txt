"how to use the varchar data type in blank? i have this piece of code and i want to make it varchar not string. what is the appropriate syntax to do that in blank.. string emri = row[""nome""].tostring();...i have a query that i have to run and i use emri in it and compare it with a column in table which i have created in mysql. the column in mysql is of type varchar(20). when i execute my code it gives an error in my query and i was guessing maybe it was for this reason ..i have this query .string query = ""if not exists(select * from clienti where codcliente=   "" + id + ""  and nome = '"" + emri + ""' and ragionesociale=' "" + ragsoc + "" ' and partitaiva=' "" + piva + "" ') insert into clienti values("" + id + "" ,' "" + emri + "" ',' "" + ragsoc + "" ',' "" + piva + "" ') else update clienti set( "" + id + "" ,' "" + emri + "" ',' "" + ragsoc + "" ',' "" + piva + "" ')"";...and it gives me this problem ..you have an error in your sql syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your mysql server version for the right syntax to use near 'if not exists(select * from clienti where codcliente=   1  and nomecliente = 'jo' at line 1"
