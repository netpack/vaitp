"blank make form1 do an action after form2 is closed i'm new to blank and i've been reading documentation and old questions, but i can't find figure out how to do the following...i have two forms, form1 and form2...form1 contains a datagridview with content from a file. a button on form1 opens form2, where the user can enter information in textboxes. the user then clicks a button on form2 which adds the new content to the file. this all works fine...now, there's an exit button on form2. what i want is that when the user exits form2, form1 will immediately call the method to reload the datagridview so it's updated. how do i call this method automatically when form2 is closed?..thank you, your help is greatly appreciated!"
