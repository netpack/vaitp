"convert from datetime to unix milliseconds i got function which is converting unix time to datime which is working great anyhow now i need function to convert from datetime to unix timestamp but something is wrong with this because when i am passing datetime somehow the last 3 digits are not shown for instance i have this timestamp: ""1300124700345"" which is equal to: 14.03.2011 5:45 pm. when i pass that to my function i am retrieving: ""1300124700"" - 3 last digits dissaperd...static readonly datetime unixepoch = .       new datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, datetimekind.utc);..public static long tounixtime(datetime date).{.    return convert.toint64((date - unixepoch).totalseconds);.}"
