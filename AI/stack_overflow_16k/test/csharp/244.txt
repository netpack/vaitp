"public setter method will not update so i've been scratching my head on this one for a while and i cannot figure it out.  i went through some debugging steps to see where it's hanging up, and visual studio will not give me anything.  basically, i have a class with an array that keeps track of the current index to the array and the current image...however, when i'm debugging (or not debugging), no matter what the value of ""index"" is, ""currentlocation"" doesn't get updated.  i can't seem to figure out what the problem might be.  any suggestions?..public class testclass : inotifypropertychanged.{.    //.....    public void goto(int index).    {.        if (index == currentlocation).            return;.        else if (index &gt;= data.length).            this.currentlocation = data.length - 1;.        else if (index &lt;= 0).            this.currentlocation = 0;.        else.            this.currentlocation = index;..        //this is where the debugging drops off.    }..    //doesn't matter if i initialize the value or not.    //private int _currentlocation = 0;.    private int _currentlocation;.    public int currentlocation.    {.        get { return _currentlocation; }.        set .        { .            //never hits this line.            this.setproperty(ref this._currentlocation, value); .            //more work .        }.    }.    //....}"
