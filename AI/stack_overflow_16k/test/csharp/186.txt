"method returning a bool on not exists from two lists of different types i'm trying to write a method which will return a bool based on two lists...loadedbillsites - the first list is of type list&lt;string&gt;, this is a list of site numbers that have been read in from a csv...storedsites - the second list is of type mymodel which contains around 10 properties, one of which a string called sitenumber...my method currently looks like this:..public bool aresitesstored().{.    var loadedbillsites = _invoicerepository.getallbillsites(path).distinct().tolist(); //read file in, return list of sites contained in file..    var storedsites = _siterepository.getallsites(); //get all known sites from database..    //return false if loadedbillsites contains anything 'unknown' to the system.}...i'm struggling to compare the storedsites.sitenumber with the loadedbillsites list. i've attempted to use the linq.except method but i'm seeing extension method errors, and cannot get a handle on the sitenumber. ..    var unknownsites = loadedbillsites.except(); //&lt;- storedsites.sitenumber?..    if (unknownsites.count &gt; 0).    {.        return false;.    }.    return true;...is there a way of achieving what i want easily?"
