"if and return is efficient or if and else if is efficient/recommended? could someone tell me which of the below 2 snippets is efficient/recommended and why?..private void method1().{.    if(condition).    {.    //some code to be executed when the condition is met.    return;.    }.    //some code to be executed when the condition is not met.}..private void method2().{.    if(condition).    {.     //some code to be executed when the condition is met.    }.    else.    {.     //some code to be executed when the condition is not met.    }.}...the answers given in the below question have not mentioned anything with respect to my question in terms of efficiency or recommended practice, the question looks like it is merely asking for what is right...in an if-else statement for a method return, should an else be explicitly stated if it can instead be implicitly followed?"
