what is alternative to timer control in blank. net i am using the timer control and i call lots of functions (ie. 20-30 sub in timer1_tick event ).may be due to performing these multiple operations in interval of 500 milliseconds may applications     not responding after 2-3 minute....so there is any alternative for using the timer control.....please suggest me.....if i use multithreading then it is not possible to update values/properties of other controls. it gives an error
