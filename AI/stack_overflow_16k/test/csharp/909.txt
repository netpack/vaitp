"determine if an object has a property (set to null or anything else) i would like to determine if an object has a property specified. the value of the property can be null or any value, i just need the key to be there. my attempts so far have been using reflection, but this didn't help:..var t = typeof(myobject);.propertyinfo p = t.getproperty(""myproperty"");.if (p == null).{.    //property does not exist.    return false;.}.return true;...the problem here is that the value of the field is null, it returns false to me. i just want to be able to detect that the property is present. thank you!"
