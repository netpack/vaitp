"does sorting value types create copies? how is sorting for value types implemented in blank? ..i cannot delete the (implicit) default constructor for structs to see that the compiler/runtime doesn't call it but i suspect it does a copy when sorting as even holding a temporary (value) to do a swap on implies a copy, though this could be achieved with pointers instead, but there is nothing i can see in the generics code to indicate it does anything special for value types vs reference types...the il ..il_0060: ldloc.0      // foobyvalues.il_0061: ldloc.1      // comparer.il_0062: callvirt     instance void class [system.collections]system.collections.generic.list`1&lt;valuetype devopscourse.tests.common.functionalcomparertest/foobyvalue&gt;::sort(class [system.runtime]system.collections.generic.icomparer`1&lt;!0/*valuetype devopscourse.tests.common.functionalcomparertest/foobyvalue*/&gt;).il_0067: nop          ...just refers to a virtual call i cannot look into so i have no idea how it is really implemented. ..i couldn't find any documentation pertaining to this either."
