"blank using a while loop to calculate whats left on a card after purchases have been made for the code below, i'm trying to figure out to break out of the while loop when the card reaches 0, and then report to the user what they owe. right now it displays both ending messages and then reports the negative numbers when it goes over and then ends as it should. can anyone give me a tip on what i'm doing wrong so i can move forward?..console.writeline(""how much do you have on your gift card?"");.string cardstring = console.readline();.decimal cardamount;// we dont need to initalize the sum of this variable because we will get that from the user..while (!decimal.tryparse(cardstring, out cardamount))//validate.{.    console.writeline(""please enter how much you have on your gift card!"");.    cardstring = console.readline();.}.while (cardamount &gt;= 0) // while loop to determine amount after each purchase. .{.    console.writeline(""how much was your purchase?"");.    string purchasestring = console.readline();.    decimal purchaseamount;.    while (!decimal.tryparse(purchasestring, out purchaseamount))// validating user response inside while loop..    {.        console.writeline(""please enter how much your purchase was!"");.        purchasestring = console.readline();.    }..    cardamount -= purchaseamount; // this line is very important! this is how we subtract and get the values we want every time the loop goes through..    console.writeline(""with your current purchase of $"" + purchaseamount + "", you can still spend $"" + cardamount + ""."");..    if (cardamount &lt;= 0).    {.        console.writeline(""with your last purchase of $"" + purchaseamount + "", you have used your gift card up and still owe $"" + cardamount + ""."");.        //break;.    }"
