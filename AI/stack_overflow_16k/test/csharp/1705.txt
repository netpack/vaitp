"the length of data is invalid while decrypting a txt file i made a console app to decrypt a file .  please refer to the screenshot for detail error message...if you copy paste the code in a console app . you should be able to debug . ..1) need to make folder sourcefoldernewfolder and a new txt file destination.txt ..2) need to make folder for c:destinationfoldersource.txt(encrypted file cannot attach file here i hope you can make one..using system;.using system.io;.using system.security.cryptography;..namespace consoleapp5.{.    class program.    {.    //salt is a random data that is used as addition to a password to encrypt data.    // the primary function is to protect against lists of often used password.    private static readonly byte[] salt = new byte[] {0x26,0xdc,0xff,0x76,0x76,.                                                            0xad,0xed,0x7a,0x64,0xc5,0xfe.                                                            ,0x20,0xaf,0x4d,0x08,0x3c};..    static void main(string[] args).    {..        //need to make a sourcefolder and but the file in there abc.txt.        string path = @""c:sourcefoldernew folder"";.        string[] txtfile = directory.getfiles(path, ""*.txt"");.        string fileinnn = txtfile[0];....        //get the filepath of the decrypted file. need to make this folder and add a new file that is what i am donig for now for this cosole app .        string filepathdecrypted = @""c:destinationfolderdestination.txt"";  //this is a new file need to create..        //get the password .        string encrytionkey = ""password."";.        decrypt(fileinnn, filepathdecrypted, encrytionkey);.    }..    public static void decrypt(string filein, string fileout, string password).    {.        //open filestreat for encrypted source file.        using (system.io.filestream fsin = new filestream(filein, filemode.open, fileaccess.read)).        {..            using (system.io.filestream fsout = new filestream(fileout, filemode.openorcreate, fileaccess.write)).            {.                try.                {.                    //create key and iv from the password with the salt .                    rfc2898derivebytes pdf = new rfc2898derivebytes(password, salt);..                    //create a symmetric algorithm with rijndael.                    rijndael alg = rijndael.create();..                    alg.padding = paddingmode.pkcs7;.                    //alg.blocksize = 128;...                    //set key and iv .                    alg.key = pdf.getbytes(32);.                    alg.iv = pdf.getbytes(16);.                    //create a cryptostream ..                    using (cryptostream cs = new cryptostream(fsout, alg.createdecryptor(), cryptostreammode.write)).                    {.                        //intialize the buffer and process the input in chunks .                        // this is done to avoid reading the whole file which is huge and memory consumption. ..                        int bufferlen = 4096;.                        byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferlen];.                        int bytesread;.                        do.                        { //read a chunck of data from the input file .                            bytesread = fsin.read(buffer, 0, bufferlen);..                            //decrypt it .                            cs.write(buffer, 0, bytesread);.                        }.                        while (bytesread != 0);..                        //close everything .                        cs.close();   //this is where it throws exception.                        fsout.close();.                        fsin.close();.                    }.                }.                catch (exception ex).                {.                    var error = ex.message;..                    throw;.                }.            }.        }.    }.}...}..error message that i am getting"
