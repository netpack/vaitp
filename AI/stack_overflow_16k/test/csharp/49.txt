"how to call object from one class to another in blank i have a problem that i just can't solve on my own. i am new to programming and i would appreciate if you could help me with this issue:.i have a class i would like to inherit from:  ..namespace rsdeployer.common.sqlservercommunication         .{.    public class rsdatabaseconnectioncreator: loggerbase.    {.        public rsprofile profile;.        public rsdatabaseconnectioncreator(rsprofile profile).        {.            this.profile = profile;.        }..        public sqlconnection createconnection(rsdatabasenames databasename, bool usewindowsauthentication, bool testconnection = false).        {.            var connectionstring = buildrsdatabaseconnectionstring(databasename, usewindowsauthentication);            .            if (testconnection).            {.                return isconnectionavailable(connectionstring) ? new sqlconnection(connectionstring) : null;.            }.            return new sqlconnection(connectionstring);.        }.    }.}...and i would like to call createconnection() in another class to inject to methods to allow me to open connection and then execute scripts..edit 1 - class i would like to have it injected to.    ..        public void queryexecution(string sqlquery).    {..        //here's where i would like to inject it.        sqlcommand command = new sqlcommand(sqlquery, conn);.        var file = new streamwriter(@""d:projectrsdeployerimportedquery.txt"");.        file.writeline(command);.        file.close();.    }...if this question is way to silly to deserve answer would you just point in the direction where i should read about it?..i hope this question is well asked and clear..thanks in advance."
