"updating a list with linq assuming i have some objects like this:..class networkswitch.{  .   private string _name; .   string name { get {return _name;} set {_name=value;}}.   dictionary&lt;int, vlan&gt; vlandict = new dictionary&lt;int, networkswitch&gt;();..public list&lt;ciscoswitch&gt; getallneigbors().         {.           list&lt;ciscoswitch&gt; templist = new list&lt;ciscoswitch&gt;();..        foreach (keyvaluepair&lt;int, ciscovsan&gt; vlanpair in this.vlandict).        {..            templist.addrange((vlanpair.value.neighborslist.except(templist, new switchbynamecomparer())).tolist());.        }.        return templist;.}..class vlan.{ .  private int _vlannum;.  int vlannum {get {return _vlannum ;} set {_vlannum =value;}}..  //a neighbor is another switch this switch is connected to in this vlan.  // the neighbor may not have all same vlans.  list&lt;networkswitch&gt; neighbors = new list&lt;networkswitch&gt;();.}...the above is designed that way because two switches that are physically connected may not have all the same vlans assigned.   what i am attempting to do is step through the neighbors list in each vlan on a given switch and update the reference to another switch if the name matches one in an input list.   here is what i tried and it won't compile.  i am wondering if linq can do it in place somehow, or if there is a better approach...// intersect is the input list of networkswitch objects.//mynetworkswitch is a previously created switch..foreach (networkswitch ns in intersect).{.  foreach (keyvaluepair&lt;int, vlan&gt; vlanpair in mynetworswitch.vlandict).  {.      foreach (ciscoswitch neighbor in vlanpair.value.neighbors).      {   // this is the line that fails - i can't update neighbor as it is part of the foreach.          if (ns.name == neighbor.name) { neighbor = ns; }.      }.  }.}...another question - i added the method that gets all the neighbors for a networkswitch object.  assuming i were to get that list, then update it with references to a different instance of the switch with the same name, would that update the reference in the vlan for the networkswitch object?"
