"any disadvantage of using getstringasync vs getstring for httpclient? this question is related to entire ""async-await"" implementation..i will keep it simple..example:..httpclient client = new httpclient();  .string urlcontents = await client.getstringasync(""http://msdn.microsoft.com"");...is there any reason to use client.getstring()?..why not just name getstringasync as getstring, and get rid of non-async getstring? and get rid of async-await keywords at all?..i read many posts, but didn't find a clear simple explanation...why create so many duplicate methods, what's the point? it just doesnt feel right. give me a reason why use non-async method? don't you want long running methods to use available threads and cpu cores to run things in parallel?.(obviously it has nothing to do with the web-based ajax async operations)"
