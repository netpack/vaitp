"initializing all string properties to some value i have some object models that contain strings. some of these properties get populated at runtime but some don't so when i map these objects back to some database fields, some fields get stored as null instead of just an empty string. to get around this, i set these properties to = """"; in the constructors. now i've got about 30 of these string properties so that's a lot of lines that just set string properties to """". is there a way to say ..""at object instantiation, set all strings to = """";...so that i can write..public class mymodel : somespecialtypethatinitializesstrings {}...thanks."
