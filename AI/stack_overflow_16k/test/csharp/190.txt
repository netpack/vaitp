"find the index of an object in an array with unknown objects in a program that asks the name, surname and age of 10 student, at the end we have to enter the name of one of them and the program has to give their place in the array. it always tells me that the place is 0. here is the code:..public class program_pinakes.{.    public static void main(string[] args).    {.        int i; .        string[] a = new string[10]; .        string[] b = new string[10]; .        int[] c = new int[10]; .        int index = 0;..        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++).        {  .            console.write(""name: "");.            a[i] = console.readline();.            console.write(""surname: "");.            b[i] = console.readline();.            console.write(""age: "");.            c[i] = int32.parse(console.readline());.        }..        console.write(""name of student you are looking for: "");.        string name = console.readline();.        if (name == a[i]).            index = i;..        console.write(""student""+a[i]+"" is located at""+index+"" place."");.    }       .}...edit: thank you all for your answers. i found out about the indexoutofrange problem and solved it easily. the main problem was about the index returning 0. now, after i put it on the loop to search the array again, it returns 0 for the first name, 1 for the second and so on. is this the right way, or it should be returning 1 for the first name, 2 for second etc?"
