"how to handle events from variable number of sources? i have such class (sorry about posible mistakes, i'm writing it right here.) class is simplified for this example, it must be more complex of course...class sp500index {..    sp500index(list&lt;orderbook&gt; stocks) {.        foreach (var stock in stocks) {.            stock.stockupdated += stockupdated; // how to handle?.        }.    }..}...so i have a lot of sources and i need to handle stockupdated event from them. in handler i need to know index of stock in stocks list which raised the event. how to do that?..upd for perfomance reasons i don't want ""sender look-up"" instead i want index. lookup is not trivial operation and likely involves hashcode calculation equals method call etc. imagine how ofthen sp500 index changes..."
