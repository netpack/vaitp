"visual development tools the company i work for is writing software for financial organizations and this often involves doing some complex calculations. right now, a functional designer will just write down the calculation and then someone more technical (me) has to translate this to code...however, i realize that this should probably be done in an easier way. isn't there already some tool in which you can just design your functions and calculations in an easy-to-understand visual way, which would compile to a .net assembly that can be used within my projects? that way, the functional designer just has to ""draw"" the formula in this tool, generate the code/assembly and pass that on to me...(i must say, for this purpose we're already some graphical design tool but it's too limited for the more complex calculations.).[these calculations are related to loans, mortgages and insurances, often doing complex calculations to predict the profitability of a certain product compared to others.]"
