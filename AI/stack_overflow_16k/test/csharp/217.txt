"is there somthing like 'out of scope' in blank? and some related questions i am a blank-newbie...i have a function that is supposed to return all values from a list, that have the matching time-stamp:..static public pointcloud getpointsbytime (float time).{.    pointcloud returnlist = new list&lt;pointdata&gt; ();..    for (int i = 0; i &lt; _pointcloud.count; i++) {.        if (_pointcloud [i].time == time) {.            returnlist.add (_pointcloud [i]);.        }.    }..    return returnlist;.}...where..public class pointdata.{.    public float time;.    // and some other members.}...and..// let's call a list of pointdata-objects a pointcloud.using pointcloud = system.collections.generic.list&lt;pointdata&gt;;...does my function do what i want it to do? or do i have to create a new pointdata-object? am i able to use my returned pointcloud or will it be out of scope and deleted?..this may be not the best example to explain so feel free to link me to something better. i think you get what my basic quastions are."
