"access class in dll? from the main class of the windows form i'm trying to create an object of a class inside another library(dll)...but i can't create this object, because i don't get any help fom visual studio, when i'm typing the name of that class...i guess i need a reference to the library and i have tried to right click on the library and then add reference and selected the name of the project where i have my main class and windows form...but it still isn't working! have i done this wrong or have i missed something?"
