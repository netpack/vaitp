"updating a datatable in blank i have a datatable storing info about a student classroom. my table looks like this:..student id     grade     absence count.00001           85             0.00002           95             7.00002           70             5.00003           35             1...dont ask me why there are two id's that are the same... its just the way it is. now i want to update the absence count for the 00002 id that has absence count of 7. at the same time, i want to delete the 00002 entry that doesnt have the absence count of 7 (in this case the one with count 5). now i know how to query the table with a select statement and update the 00002 id student with count 7. how can i, at the same time, delete the other entry for the 00002 student? this is my code:..foreach(oldcount in absencecount).{.    datarow[] dr = dt.select(""student id='"" + id + ""' and absence count='"" + oldcount);.    dr[0][""absence count""] = newcount;.}...so here how can i tell the program that if there is another student id whose absence count isnt in the absencecount list, delete it from the table?..thanks"
