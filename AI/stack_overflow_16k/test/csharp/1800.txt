"entered wrong value. goto start; edit..based on the answers received i realized that i am asking more than i know about at this early stage in my learning and as such, i have decided to forget this question until i have learnt and understand more. i do not want to overstep and confuse myself. ..just a newbie looking for some guidance...from a previous question i asked here, i was introduced to the goto start; in the switch statement. ..i started using it and it had me thinking that i wanted the program to go to the start in the event the user entered an invalid input. example, in my calculator below, if the user enters something other than a number, how do i get the program to disregard the input and prompt the user again to enter a number? maybe even display an ""invalid input. please try again"" to the user. ..right now, if anything but a number is entered, the console crashes and throws me an error. ..thanks in advance for the assistance..      int num1, num2, output;.        string  op;..        console.write(""nn"");.        console.writeline(""calculatorn"");.        console.writeline(""============="");.        console.write(""nn"");..        start:..        console.write(""please enter first number:"");.        num1 = convert.toint32(console.readline());...        console.write(""please enter second number: "");.        num2 = convert.toint32(console.readline());..        operator:..        console.writeline(""please select operator: "");.        console.writeline(""naddition : +"");.        console.writeline(""multiplication: *"");.        console.writeline(""division: /"");.        console.writeline(""subtraction: -"");.        console.write(""enter operator: "");.        op = console.readline();.....        switch (op).        {.            case ""+"":.                output = num1 + num2;.                console.writeline(""{0} added to {1} = {2}"", num1, num2, output);.                break;..            case ""*"":.                output = num1 * num2;.                console.writeline(""{0} multiplied by {1} = {2}"", num1, num2, output);.                break;..            case ""/"":.                if (num2 == 0).                {.                    console.writeline(""cannot divide by zero. please try again"");.                    goto start;..                }.                else.                {.                    output = num1 / num2;.                    console.writeline(""{0} divided by {1} = {2}"", num1, num2, output);.                    break;.                }..            case ""-"":.                output = num1 - num2;.                console.writeline(""{0} minus{1} = {2}"", num1, num2, output);.                break;..            default:.                console.writeline(""you entered an invalid operator. please try againn"");.                goto operator;                     ..         }..       console.writeline(""npress enter to continue...."");.       console.readline();"
