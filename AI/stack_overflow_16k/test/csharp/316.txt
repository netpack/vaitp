"how do i define a property to read an attribute from, without instantionating an object? suppose i have:..class person.{.[columnattribute(""id""].    public int id;.[columnattribute(""name""].public string name;.[columnattribute(""dateofbirth""].    public date birthdate;.}...i want to read the attribute on some property but without instantionating the person object. say for example i want to read the attribute defined on name property.but i want it to be like that readattribute(person.name) without creating an object...why do i want that? because this person object is a entity object for a framework i am creating, and i want to be able to define the column on which i want to sort the return from the dal layer.  ..i don't want to pass strings because that way the string will get out of sync when i change the database and so on.  ..so is this possible? the function of the dal is person.getallbyage(int age, /somehow here i want to define the sorting/).if there is another way to fix this problem i will be happy to hear it. i was thinking of using expression tree maybe, but i am stuck there too..thanks..edit:..thank you all for answearing but the question is not about reading attributes..i want when calling the dal to call something like that.dal.person.getallbyage(25, birthdate).this will return all the persons which are 25 years old sorted by name.this can be done currently by calling.dal.person.getallbyage(25, ""dateofbirth"").thanks"
