"trigger ""set"" when changed class object property blank if i have a custom class vector3 and i have a class object myobject that use the vector3 class as a property and when i set a new vector .myobject.pos = new vector3(x,y,z); the set will trigger in this case debug.log(""set"") as expected but if i instead of creating a new vector i only want to change x but still have set triggered i would want to do myobject.pos.x = x but this will not trigger the set in myobject but the set in my vector3 class for x is there any way of fixing this so set in myobject triggers when i change only the ""sub property"" x of the vector3...public class myobject{.        private vector3 p_pos = new vector3(0, 0, 0);.        public vector3 pos.        {.            get { return (p_pos); }.            set.            {.                debug.log(""set"");.                p_pos = value;.            }.        }.}...the only way i can think of doing it is to create a separate method in myobject class like this myobject.setposx(x):..public void setposx(double _x).{.    debug.log(""set"");.    p_pos.x = _x;.}...but it is not a very clean way of doing it so would prefer another solution."
