"blank tcpclient connection and multiple threads i am new to tcp programming so here is a few simple questions:...client app is calling a listener..i am opening a connection with tcpclient:..tcpclient mytcp = new tcpclient(""server"", 1000);.mytcp.connect();...for how long will mytcp hold a connection? is there any default value? can i change it?.if my calling application has a multiple threads (it's a wcf service), each of threads has to call a listener. can i create mytcp as a singleton and reuse it in multiple threads?.if question 2 yes, how many simultaneous connections can mytcp handle?.with singleton approach is there a chance to have synchronization issue between calls and responses?"
