"blocking/disabling picture box when that number is picked. deal or no deal game blank i am creating a deal or no deal game. i have 22 picture boxes. 11 on one side and the other 11 on the other. with the boxes that the user can pick in the middle. i wan't to remove or disable the relevant picture box when the box that contains that amount is picked. the amount of money the box contains is created randomly. so say for instance box 15 contains 100000. i want to remove the picture box which holds the image of the £100,000. is there any way in which i could do this?..here is my global arrays etc: ..double[] box = new double[22];.    double[] values = new double[22] {0.01, 0.10, 0.50, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 35000, 50000, 75000, 100000, 250000};.    //picturebox[] picturbox = new picturebox[22];.    random myrand = new random();.    bool start = true;.    //bool pick = true;.    int count = 0;...here is my code for creating the random values:.. private void frm_dealornodeal_shown(object sender, eventargs e).   {.       txt_bankersoffer.hide();         // hiding text until box is picked.       txt_offer.hide();                 // hiding text until box is picked.       bool found = false;              .       int rand_loc = myrand.next(22);  //random number generator for the boxes..       box[0] = values[rand_loc];.       values[rand_loc] = 0;..       for (int x = 1; x &lt; 22; x++ ).       {.           found = true;.           while (found).           {.               found = false;.               rand_loc = myrand.next(22);.               if (values[rand_loc] != 0).               {.                   box[x] = values[rand_loc];.                   values[rand_loc] = 0;.               }.               else.               {.                   found = true;.               }.           }..       }....   }...&amp; finally here is the code that i have for a button click event when they are picking their boxes. the code for all the other boxes is the same. ..private void btn_box_2_click(object sender, eventargs e).   {.       if (start == true).       {.           start = false;               .           pic_pick.hide();.           btn_box_2.location = new point(584, 543);..       }.       else.       {.           txt_boxcontentstext.show();.           txt_boxcontentsnuber.show();.           txt_bankersoffer.hide();.           txt_offer.hide();.           txt_boxcontentsnuber.text = convert.tostring(box[2 - 1]);.           btn_box_2.enabled = false;.           btn_box_2.backcolor = color.gray;.           count++;.       }..       if (count == 5 || count == 8 || count == 11 || count == 14 || count == 17 || count == 20).       {.           txt_boxcontentstext.show();.           txt_boxcontentsnuber.show();.           txt_bankersoffer.show();.           txt_offer.show();.           txt_offer.text = convert.tostring(1000);.       }..   }...while i'm here could anyone come up with a good formula that i could use to give them the bankers offers? ..cheers. ..picture of form:.(you cant see the last picture box for the left hand side £750 or the right hand side £250,000 but they are there.)"
