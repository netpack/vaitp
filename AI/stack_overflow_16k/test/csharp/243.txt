the different with methods i am new to blank and i am trying to understand what is the difference when you are passing and argument or no argument in a method...i think i kind of understand. would it be if you was to pass an argument it would be something like this...int numa = 4;..int producta =  squar(numa); ...i just don't understand how to have a method where it is not passing an argument.
