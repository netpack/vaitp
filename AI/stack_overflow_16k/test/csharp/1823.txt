"linq lambda for counting number of sequences i have the sample student data as follows:..examdate           test           result.01/21/2017         math           pass .06/02/2017         science        pass.05/31/2018         math           fail.06/28/2018         science        pass .07/03/2018         math           pass .07/19/2018         science        fail *.08/01/2018         math           fail .09/13/2018         science        fail *.09/15/2018         math           fail .10/01/2018         science        fail *.12/15/2019         math           pass .10/11/2019         science        fail *.......in the above sorting examdate, there is 4 consecutive science fail tests mark by * or (4-1) = 3 science sequential fails in a row. similarly, there is 2 consecutive math fail tests or 1 math sequential fail...how can i group above data using linq lambda into a format like below:.    science: 4 consecutive fail tests or (4-1) = 3 sequential fails.    math: 2 consecutive fail tests or (2-1) = 1 sequential fails...need help linq syntax to count how many sequential consecutive fails each test (math, science) based on sorting exam date?"
