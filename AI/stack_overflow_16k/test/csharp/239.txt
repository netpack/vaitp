"using combobox selection in sql statements i would like to insert a number, for example 112, into a table cell. the column should be selected from a combobox. for example, if combobox1 text is ""name"", then data should be inserted into column ""name"" in table1...the code below does not seem to work:..cmd.commandtext = ""insert into table1 ('"" + combobox1.selecteditem + ""') values ('"" + txtbox1.text + ""')"";...with a hardcoded column name it works:..cmd.commandtext = ""insert into table1 (name) values ('"" + txtbox1.text + ""')"";...how can i insert the combobox selection into the statement?"
