"datetimepicker valuechanged event repeats with month arrow when the month forward or backward arrow is clicked on my datetimepicker .control it repeatedly fires the valuechanged event. i have to use the .debugger to stop the application...note: my application works fine as long as i click on one of the dates...the msdn documentation shows examples for creating the control. but i cannot .find any example function called datetimepicker1_valuechanged(). the skeleton .for this function was created for me, when i double clicked on the control in .the vs.net2008 designer."
