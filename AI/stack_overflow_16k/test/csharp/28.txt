"is this a bad practice in overloading a method? i had a method like this that its consumers are calling it:..static public void displayordercomments(param1, param2, param3, param4)...now i added an overload for it like this:..static public void displayordercomments(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5).{.    displayordercomments(param1, param2, param3, param4);.    param5.foo();.}...is it a bad practice? are there better ways of doing it?"
