"how do i use tolower with startswith i need your help..i want a user make an input to search a list of objects..here, the user should specify the initial letter of the object...now the problem, since some words are capitalized and other small i would like to regulate so that both the user input and the object from the list are always written in small...i thought you might be able to do that with tolower but that does not work on the list object..incidentally, the list object is a string...is there an easy solution with the tolower or how can this be done best?..console.writeline(""please enter the first letter"");..string search = console.readline().tolower();..console.clear();..foreach(var erg in speichert).{.    if (erg.b_name.tolower().startswith(search)).    {.        console.writeline(""something"");.    }.}"
