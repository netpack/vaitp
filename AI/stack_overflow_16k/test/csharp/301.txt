"blank control two motors according to the mouseclicks on a picturebox i am developing a blank win form gui for controlling a two-motor xy stage. i have drawn a 100 x 100 square grid pattern on a picturebox in which each square, when clicked, represents a coordinate that the two motors must move to. i have studied this link.picturebox grid and selecting individual cells when clicked on and this picturebox- grids and filling in squares (game of life) for drawing a grid and marking the clicked positions...now i have to transform the series of randomly clicked points to actual movement of the two motors...how shall i translate the click coordinates programmatically to give commands to control the motors? ..i know how to move and control the motors without referring to the screen coordinates, i.e. by using eyes.  ..thank you very much for your kind help...update1:.hello... i think i am thinking too much in a confusing way to move the motors from one point to another despite sebastien's great help. i wanted to try some logic below but i appreciate if somebody can enlighten me how best to implement this. ..    private void pictureboxgrid_mouseclick(object sender, mouseeventargs e).    {.        //int x = e.x;.        int x = cellsize * (e.x / cellsize);.        int y = cellsize * (e.y / cellsize);.        int i = x / 8; // to limit the value to below 100.        int j = y / 8;..        // reverse the value of fill_in[i, j] - if it was false, change to true,.        // and if true change to false.        fill_in[i, j] = !fill_in[i, j];..        if (fill_in[i, j]).        {.            //save the coordinate in a list.            filledsq.add(new point(i, j));..            using (graphics g = graphics.fromimage(buffer)).            {.                g.fillrectangle(brushes.black, x + 1, y + 1, 7, 7);.            }..        }.        else.        {.            //delete the coordinate in a list.            filledsq.remove(new point(i, j));.            color customcolor = systemcolors.controllightlight;..            using (graphics g = graphics.fromimage(buffer)).            using (solidbrush shadowbrush = new solidbrush(customcolor)).            {.                g.fillrectangle(shadowbrush, x + 1, y + 1, 7, 7);.            }..        }.        //pictureboxgrid.backgroundimage = buffer;.        pictureboxgrid.invalidate();.    }..    private void buttonsavepoints_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        // to be implemented....    }..    private void buttonrun_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {..        var noofdots = filledsq.count;.        filledsq = filledsq.orderby(p =&gt; p.x).thenby(p =&gt; p.y).tolist();.        var motor = new motor();.        for (var i = 0; i &lt; noofdots; i++).        {.          motor.move(filledsq[i].x, filledsq[i].y); //call the motor to move to x,y here?.         //do sth at each position.        }.    }"
