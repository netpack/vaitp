"how to properly manipulate variable so i'm trying to create a string variable that contains some text and a variable inside as well that gets the data from a textbox:..        string var1, var2;..        var1 = txt1.text;.        var2 = ""some text"" + var1 + ""some text"";...this is not so hard when i try it inside a button event but var2 is going to be used very often on my program and it has a lot of text inside. if possible i want to minimize declaring the variable over and over on every event needed. i would imagine it'd be easier if this could happen:..    string var1 = textbox.text;.    string var2 = ""a lot of text"" + var1 + ""a lot of text"";..    public form1().    {.        initializecomponent();.    }..    private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        rtextbox.text = ""a lot of text"" + var2;.    } ...var2 would be used as a signature so i need to access it a lot of times. if there's an easier way then i'm open to suggestions...when using the above code in declaring the variable i don't get an intellisense for the textbox so i'm getting an error. i need help so that i can declare the variable like the way illustrated above. i'm using vs2010. if using a higher version would help then i'll try it. ..i have only touch the surface of blank programming so anything you see that might be disrepecting is not meant that way."
