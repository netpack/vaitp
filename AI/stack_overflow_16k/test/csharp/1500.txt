"byte to string ""decimal point is a problem"" this code is written in blank dot net..i am receiving data in below mention format.49 46 48 50 which is equivalent to 1.02 in decimal format.using this simple code..data = convert.tobyte(serialport1.readbyte());...later i add data in a buffer..buffer[byte_count++] = data;   // byte[] buffer = new byte[256];...now with 49 46 48 50 data byte value..buffer[1] contains 49.buffer[2] contains 46.buffer[3] contains 48.buffer[4] contains 50...problem is the decimal point.i can convert 49 to 1 by simple subtracting byte value from 48.but how could i convert 46 into the decimal point and save all bytes into an strings..really very appreciate if any one can solve my problem.ashraf"
