"use more than one font to drawstring i want to use drawstring to print a sentance but some parts of it has to be bold. what is the best way to do this? yes, i have considered using two drawstring. but is there a intelligent way of using two drawstrings if we have to...we cannot make any assumtion about the length of the sentance. however it is prepared in a format...eg: ..say hello to name. good afternoon .name. ..thanks"
