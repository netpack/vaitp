using serialization to talk between two process/applications (inter process communication) recently i was asked the following in a interview:..there is a process/application a which is constantly getting messages every 5 minutes (assume)..the requirement is that there is a process/application b which needs the messages to be transferred from a...but process/application a should make sure that the message has actually been received by process/application b...the interviewer wanted to know how can this be implemented in blank. can we use serialization here?..from my understanding the best way this can be done is using message queue or pipe mechanism.
