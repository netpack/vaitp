"struggling with blank events examples i'm struggling to implement some events into some code i'm working on, and the examples provided in the textbook i'm working through don't compile (blank player's handbook, 3rd edition). i've been trying to figure out what i'm not getting about events/event handlers, etc. to no avail. ..i'm using microsoft visual studio (most recent update), and this is the code i'm trying to make work (i didn't write it -- but i think figuring out why it won't work will help me with the other event problems i'm having)...namespace eventspractice.{.    class program.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            point point = new point();..            point.pointchanged += handlepointchanged;.        }..    }.    class point.    {.        private double x;.        private double y;..        public double x.        {.            get { return x; }.            set.            {.                x = value;.                onpointchanged();.            }.        }.        public double y.        {.            get { return y; }.            set.            {.                y = value;.                onpointchanged();.            }..        }..        public event eventhandler pointchanged;..        public void onpointchanged().        {.            if (pointchanged != null).                pointchanged(this, eventargs.empty);.        }..        public void handlepointchanged(object sender, eventargs eventargs).        {.            // do something here.        }..    }.}...the problem is that on the line  ..point.pointchanged += handlepointchanged;...i am getting the error 'the name handlepointchanged does not exist in this context.'..am i missing something obvious? why won't this work?..thanks in advance!"
