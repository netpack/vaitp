"blank i want to calculate a number in base 3 i work for a university and we have session numbers that go like this:..yyyys...where yyyy is four digit year (e.g. 2017, 2020 etc.) and s is a semester which can be 1, 2, 3 (1 stands for spring, 2 is summer and 3 is winter). some examples:..20171 spring semester in year 2017.20172 summer    -/-           2017 .20173 winter    -/-           2017 .20181 spring    -/-           2018...i want to implement semester + and - arithmetics (+ 1 means next semester, - 1 means previous one), e.g. ..20171 + 1 == 20172 (adding 1 semester)           i.e. 2017 spring + 1 = 2017 summer.20171 - 1 == 20163 (subtracting 1 semester)      i.e. 2017 spring - 1 = 2016 winter.20171 + 3 == 20181 (adding 3 semesters - a year) i.e. 2017 spring + 3 = 2018 spring .20173 + 8 == 20202 (adding 8 semesters)          i.e. 2017 winter + 8 = 2020 summer...any idea ???"
