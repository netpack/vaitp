"how to catch particular data from complicated string content with conditions? i have a memory mapped file which is holding data of stock market. i am storing data like below:..symbol, date, open, high, close, low, volume.aapl,25/01/2019 03:00:00,153.55,153.9,153.9,153.55,821.aapl,25/01/2019 03:02:00,154.2,154.21,154.21,154.2,966..now we want to get a list of close price from each line. exactly we need like, if current time stamp is 25/01/2019 11:35:00 am and condition is for 15 ticks then i need close price list from 25/01/2019 11:19:00 am to 11:34:00 am. ..i am trying to catch close price using substring and split but i have more then 10,000 records so this will make strange...string name = ""aapl,25/01/2019 03:00:00,153.55,153.9,153.9,153.55,821"";.//name = name.substring(name.indexof(',') + 1);.//name = name.split(',').last();"
