"database updates in debug mode but not release mode (file problem?) using sqlite, blank..basically, i have an sqlite database that gets queried using simple """"insert into jobapplicantsdb..."" queries using blank. the problem is that the database updates properly when it's in the debug folder but not when it's in the release folder. i have tried copying and pasting from debug file to the release folder and changing the connection string in blank to the location and the file says that it is updated but the data inside the database remains the same. i have no clue what is wrong and i'm running out of guesses. i'm pretty sure the code is not the problem and much more a problem with file pathing. ..private sqliteconnection sql_con;.private void setconnection().{.    sql_con = new sqliteconnection.
