"specifying a generic type parameter using a string suppose i have a method..public void whatever&lt;t&gt;() { ... }...suppose i have a type in the form of a string..var mytype = ""system.string"";...normally, i'd call the method like:..whatever&lt;string&gt;();...but i'd like to be able to call it using mytype somehow. is this possible?.i know this doesn't work, but conceptually:..whatever&lt;type.gettype(mytype)&gt;();"
