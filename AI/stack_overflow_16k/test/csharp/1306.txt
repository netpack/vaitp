"how does const and readonly keyword work in blank 7.3 while looking at the most common mistakes while working with const &amp; readonly. i came across this post...i tried doing with an example where an assembly assemblya contains the const and readonly 100 &amp; 100 respectively. and now while consuming assemblya in assemblyb, the application takes corrects values...but when i changed the const &amp; readonly to 200 &amp; 200 and rebuilt assemblyb. assemblyb is consuming the 200 &amp; 200. i just really want to replicate the scenario for when const value is being changed...below are scenarios ...when const &amp; readonly values are changed from (100,100) to (200,200) assemblya is build, run assemblyb it consumes the updated values(200,200).when const &amp; readonly values are changed from (100,100) to (200,200) and .cs is saved. then assemblyb it consumes the  values(100,100). is this what the post tells us??.when const &amp; readonly values are changed from (100,100) to (200,200) and .cs is saved. then assemblyb is rebuilt,it consumes the updated values(200,200)....so anybody tell me how these const and readonly variable work when dealing with different assemblies...please help in this understanding. it would be great help.thanks in advance.below is the code :..assemblya..public class classa.{.    public const int constant = 400;.    public readonly int readonly = 400;.}...assemblyb..using constantandreadonly;..namespace consumerclass.{.    class program.    {.        public void getconstandreadonly().        {.            console.writeline(classa.constant);.            classa obj = new classa();.            var readonly = obj.readonly;.            console.writeline(readonly);..        }..        static void main(string[] args).        {.            program objclass = new program();.            objclass.getconstandreadonly();.            console.readkey();.        }.    }.}"
