what is the easiest way to generate an app.config file through pure blank code i know the easiest way to generate a config file is through visual studio. however the environment my program is going to be functioning in we are going to have several different configurations and the application needs to be able to build the config files on its own. just curious if there is an easier way than making a large string literal and then copying over to a new file. thanks for any help.
