"using a star character (*) in file.getlastwritetime returns error using blank i want to get the last modified date and time of a file. for this i found system.io.file.getlastwritetime(). if i want to use it it returns the error that i got an illegal character in my path...i got this code:..string otherpath = environment.getfolderpath(environment.specialfolder.desktop) + @""test"";..private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.    datetime datetime = file.getlastwritetime(otherpath + ""*.txt""); // here the error comes up..    if (directory.getfiles(otherpath, @""*.txt"").any() &amp;&amp; datetime == datetime.now).    {.        messagebox.show(""folder has .txt file and was last modified today"");.    }..    else.    {.        messagebox.show(""folder has .txt file and was not last modified today"");.    }.}...if i remove the * character it works. but then i can't define all files with ending .txt. is there another way to do it? i already tried @""*.txt"" but this doesn't work neither...suggestion appreciated :)"
