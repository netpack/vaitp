"optimizing code to easily edit in my game there is a text that outputs code based on if certain upgrades are bought i started out coding it like this..if (upgrademanager.instance.hasupgrade(""basicfunction"") &amp;&amp; !upgrademanager.instance.hasupgrade(""basiccounter"")).{.    codestring = ""protected void gainunits(){ units += "" + gains + "";}"";.}.else if (upgrademanager.instance.hasupgrade(""basiccounter"") &amp;&amp; upgrademanager.instance.hasupgrade(""basicfunction"")).{.    codestring = ""private timer = 20; private void update(){ if(timer &gt; 0){gainunits();}"" + ""protected void gainunits(){ units += "" + gains + "";}"";.}.else if (upgrademanager.instance.hasupgrade(""basiccounter"") &amp;&amp; !upgrademanager.instance.hasupgrade(""basicfunction"")).{.    codestring = ""private timer = 20; private void update(){ if(timer &gt; 0){gainunits();}"" + ""units += "" + gains;.}.else.{.    codestring = ""units += "" + gains;.}.....as i add more and more upgrades i realize that i have to add more and more rules on top of whats already there creating an exponential amount of work as more is added to the game..so my question is how can i optimize this to lighten the workload?"
