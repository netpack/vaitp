"make a list of objects using an existing list i have a class named dataapikey. i have a second class which inherits from that one...in my code i have a list, and i would like to use that to make a list of the new class. is there any way to do this without using a for each loop?..using the example below i made the following code which seems to be doing what i want...list&lt;dataapikey&gt; apilist = db.getpendingaction(""character"");..list&lt;datacharacter&gt; charlist = apilist.select(k =&gt; {.        datacharacter dc = new datacharacter(k.apikeyid, k.keyid, k.verificationcode);.        return dc;.    }).tolist()"
