"run same exe twice i have the following code:..foreach(string filename in chunkfiles).{.    p = generateprocessinstance();.    p.startinfo.arguments = string.format(""{0} {1} false {2}"", filename, id, logname);.    p.start();.    p.waitforexit();.    sent += p.exitcode;.}...what i want to do is if i have at least 2 chunks to run the exe with 2 instances. my only problem is that i have waitforexit. i am using this because i need a parameter returned from the exe..how to solve this problem?"
