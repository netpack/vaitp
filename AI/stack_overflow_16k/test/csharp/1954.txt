"draw a rectangle in a panel of a form when a button click event is fired from another form i'm currently working on windows form application where i have two forms; form1 and form2. there is a button inside form1 which opens form2 when clicked and what i want is to create a rectangle inside a panel of form1 when a button inside form2 is clicked. i put some code to create rectangle inside the button click event of form2, but it showed nothing when clicked. however, whenever i put the draw.rectangle method inside the same form where button is clicked, it work, but differently it doesn't..here's the code inside form1 ..  private void btnsave_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        layoutsetting a = new layoutsetting();.        a.showdialog();.    }.public void drawobject().    {..            graphics g = panel1.creategraphics();.            rectangle rect = new rectangle(10, 10, 80, 90);.            rect.inflate(-10, -10);.            g.drawrectangle(black, rect);.            g.fillrectangle(brushes.blueviolet, rect);.            stringformat f = new stringformat();.            f.linealignment = stringalignment.center;.            f.alignment = stringalignment.center;.            g.drawstring(""hello"", this.font, brushes.ghostwhite, rect, f);.            panel1.refresh();. }...this is the code inside form2..  private void btnconfirm_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        form1.default.drawobject();.        this.close();.    }"
