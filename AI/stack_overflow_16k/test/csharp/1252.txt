"anonymous method in anonymous type not authorized? i try to create a call like this, which works well in javascript:..service.doaction(new { param1=""sometext"", onok= () =&gt; { console.writeline(""ok""); }});...but it does not compile with error:...  can not assign 'anonymous method' to anonymous type property...or...  can not assign 'lambda expression' to anonymous type property...any idea why this is not authorized ? language limitation ?"
