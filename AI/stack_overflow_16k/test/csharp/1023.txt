"how to set the default text of a text box from another form? i am currently developing a business program now when the program is launched it checks to see if the set-up has been completed through a non visible checkbox (i.e. if the user has done the set-up the check box will be checked if not it will be not checked)..i have tried googling this with no clear answer to how to do this...so my question is, can i set the default text of a text box and the default state of a checkbox through another form...i.e. the user runs through the set-up and types the license key which then transfers to the main menu form where the program checks the license key. then when they finish the set-up it then checks a checkbox on the main menu so the set-up no longer shows up...i already know how to transfer the text from form2 to form1 but i am just stuck on how to get it to set the default text to the text from form2...this is the code from form1:.. private void setup().        {.            if(checkbox1.checked == false).            {.                messagebox.show(""error: no setup recorded. entering setup now!"");.                timer1.enabled = false;.                setup1 ds = new setup1();.                ds.showdialog();.                textbox1.text = ds.textbox1.text;..            }..            if(checkbox1.checked == true).            {..            }...form1:.http://prntscr.com/r87r4k..set-up form(form2):.http://prntscr.com/r87r9s..(ignore the text boxes that state ""inactive"" and ""active"" that is for changing the license key status in the mysql database.)..so in the end i want it so that the license key textbox (the empty text box in the first screenshot) will always open with the provided license key during setup...thank you,..kadin"
