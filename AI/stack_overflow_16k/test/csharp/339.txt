"understanding code - lambda expressions i was looking at this code of a sieve of eratosthenes but i still couldn't get how the ""i"" variable gets incremented since i have a limited knowledge about lambda expressions and the documentation didn't help me much. can anyone explain ?    ..int cur = 1, total = 1000;.var pc = enumerable.range(2, total).tolist();..while(cur &lt;= math.sqrt(total)).{.    cur = pc.first(i =&gt; i &gt; cur);.    pc.removeall(i =&gt; i != cur &amp;&amp; i % cur == 0);.}..console.writeline(pc.max());"
