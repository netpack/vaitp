"projecteuler q1 program unexpected result i was working on problem one and my original program looked like this..int multiplesof=1000,count=0, multiple1 = 3, multiple2 = 5,val1,val2,sum=0;..while (count &lt; multiplesof).{.    if (count % multiple1 == 0).        sum = sum += count;.    if (count % multiple2 == 0).        sum = sum += count;.    count++;.}.console.out.writeline(sum + "" is the sum of all multiples"");.console.in.readline();...it give me the solution of 266333. this proved to be wrong, stumped i looked at google. i have since gotten the correct value of 233168 with the following loop. however to me they look like they do exactly the same thing. could anyone please explain why they are bring up different answers?..while (count &lt; multiplesof).{.    if (count % multiple1 == 0 || count % multiple2 == 0).        sum = sum += count;.    count++;               .}"
