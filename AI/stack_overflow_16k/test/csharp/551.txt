"create comma separated string from portion of strings in blank list i have a blank list that i want to create a comma separate string. i've found other answers on so that deal with this, but my particular case i want to only use a portion of the values in the list to create the string...if my list contained these values:..""foo"".""bar"".""car""..and i wanted to create a string..foo, bar and car....i could use this code:..string.format(""{0} and {1}."", .              string.join("", "", mylist.take(mylist.count - 1)), .              mylist.last());...however, my list is actual formed of json values like so..{ name = ""foo"" }.{ name = ""bar"" }.{ name = ""car"" }...so the above code results in:..{ name = ""foo"" }, { name = ""bar"" } and { name = ""car"" }....how would i construct the string such that i only use the foo, bar and car values in the list?..update..thanks to @stevepy, this is what i ended up with:..string.format(""{0} and {1}."", .              string.join("", "", mylist.select(x =&gt; x.name).tolist().take(mylist.count - 1)), .              mylist.select(x =&gt; x.name).tolist().last());"
