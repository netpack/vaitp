"performing a common action on derived types is there a neat way to make several classes (which say derive from 1 interface), to each perform a same action? think of http modules in asp.net which serve each request (each the key word) - is there a way to perform some common action on derived types? reflection may be one way, though i would be interested in a way at a base class level...thanks"
