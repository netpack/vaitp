"is the lost of efficiency worth returning ienumerable instead of list? everytime i've had to return a collection, i've returned a list. i've just read that i should return ienumerable or similar interface (iqueryable for instance). ..the problem i see is that often i want to work with a list. to do that, i'd have to do a .tolist() on the returned result...example..//....list&lt;guid&gt; listofguids = mymethod().tolist();.//....public ienumerable&lt;guid&gt; mymethod().{.    using (var context = accesdatarépart.getnewcontextrépart()).    {.        return context.mytable.tolist();.    }.}...is executing a .tolist() twice the right practice."
