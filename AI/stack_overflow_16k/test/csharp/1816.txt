"best way to pass case insensitive parameters i have parameters of type string that gets passed to a method. however when the parameter value gets checked in the database , it gets checked for exact case. i need the value to be returned if the value is passed either as ""test"" or ""test"" etc...currently the values are stored in db as lowercase so i am specifically passing the parameter value with .tolower..value = parameter.uid.tolower()...i was wondering if there is a more cleaner or better way to achieve this istead of adding .tolower() to every string parameters..thanks in advance"
