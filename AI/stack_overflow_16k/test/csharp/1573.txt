"is there any way to know when a method calling finished? for the question, let's say:..public class animal.{.  public animal play() {}..  public animal eat() {}..  public void sleep() {/*do something*/}.}..class main.{.  var dog = new animal();.  dog.play().eat();.}...is there any way for the sleep() method to be invoked each time a method in animal class was called? .it's a kind of testcleanup attribute in the unit test but this is just for a normal method."
