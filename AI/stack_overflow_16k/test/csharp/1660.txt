"converting an amount to a 4 byte array i haven't ever had to deal with this before. i need to convert a sale amount (48.58) to a 4 byte array and use network byte order. the code below is how i am doing it, but it is wrong and i am not understanding why. can anyone help?..float saleamount = 48.58f; .byte[] data2 = bitconverter.getbytes(saleamount).reverse().toarray();...what i am getting is 66 66 81 236 in the array. i am not certain what it should be though. i am interfacing with a credit card terminal and need to send the amount in ""4 bytes, fixed length, max value is 0xffffffff, use network byte order"""
