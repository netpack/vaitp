"ipglobalproperties.getipglobalproperties i wrote a test app to get all active ports on my network. did some searching and found this was the easiest way. so i tried it and it work just fine. i then wrote another socket app with a sever and client side. it's pretty basic, has a create sever, join server and refresh button to get the active servers. the only time this method gets called is when you press the refresh button. if i open up the application 3 or more times and create a server with connected clients by the 4th one this method starts giving me this (unknown error (0xc0000001)) error. any idea why this could happen? funny thing is i never get this on the initial application, the one i opened first. i don't know if somehow it get's a lock on this or something...the exception gets thrown at this line:..ipendpoint[] endpoints = properties.getactivetcplisteners();...here's the method, it returns an object of list for all ports within a min and max range...public static list&lt;userlocalsettings&gt; showactivetcplisteners(int min, int max).{.    list&lt;userlocalsettings&gt; res = new list&lt;userlocalsettings&gt;();.    try.    {.        ipglobalproperties properties = ipglobalproperties.getipglobalproperties();.        ipendpoint[] endpoints = properties.getactivetcplisteners();.        foreach (ipendpoint e in endpoints).        {.            if (e.port &gt; (min - 1) &amp;&amp; e.port &lt; (max + 1)).            {.                userlocalsettings tmpclnt = new userlocalsettings();.                tmpclnt.player_ip = e.address.tostring();.                tmpclnt.player_port = e.port;.                tmpclnt.computer_name = dns.gethostentry(e.address).hostname;.                res.add(tmpclnt);.            }.        }..    }.    catch (exception ex1).    {.    }.    return res;.}...here's a screen print of the exception:"
