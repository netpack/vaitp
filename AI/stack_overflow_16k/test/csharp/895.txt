"blank dll path @ runtime i am new to blank, need help in the following situation..i have created an executable application (.exe) in blank. the application depends on certain c++ dlls. hence i have used dllimport method - with the local path  to execute the application. .when i am executing the .exe as such (without blank) the application works if the dll are placed in the same level of .exe. ..i want to place all the dlls in an folder named dll and place the folder next to .exe. now the dllimport will not recognize the path. now how do i write my code to pick the current path at run time for the .exe is executed independently...i tried the below code it does not work. basically it just throws compilation error. since new to blank, though seen many online answers i am sorry not able to get a solution. please help me with this..[dllimport(system.windows.forms.application.startuppath + ""\ap4600_sdk.dll"", callingconvention = callingconvention.cdecl, entrypoint = ""readeropen"")]"
