"how to access object from another form blank so i have this class called employee that stores the employee's username and password... class employee.{.    string username;.    string password;..    public string username.    {.        get { return username; }.        set { username = value; }.    }..    public string password.    {.        get { return password; }.        set { password = value; }.    }..    public employee(string username, string password).    {.        this.username = username;.        this.password = password;.    }...in my main class, i created an instance of employee with some sample data...employee employee1 = new employee(""john"", ""123"");...i included this piece of code in the main method to authenticate the user based on his/her username and password... do.        {.            console.write(""username: "");.            username = console.readline();.            console.write(""password: "");.            password = console.readline();..            if (employee1.username != username || employee1.password != password).            {.                console.writeline(""incorrect username or password. please try again n"");.            }.        }.        while (employee1.username != username || employee1.password != password);..        console.clear();.        console.write(""login sucessful!. press any key to continue..."");.        console.readkey();...instead of having this chunk of code in my main class, i want to transfer this code in employee.cs that acts as a method, and can be called from the main class. my problem is, how can i access the object from the main class, and get the initialized username and password to apply the same concept on employee.cs."
