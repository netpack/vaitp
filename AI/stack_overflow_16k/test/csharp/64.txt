"how to get a previous week number based on current date in blank? i want to get the number of previous week of previous year in blank. for example, today is week 1 of 2015 and i want to get the last week as in week number 52 of year 2014...currently my code is,..var weekno = currentculture.calendar.getweekofyear(.             datetime.now.date,.             currentculture.datetimeformat.calendarweekrule,.             currentculture.datetimeformat.firstdayofweek);...and it returns week 1. i have a loop which used to run from week number 1 to weekno - 1 to get the data of last year but now weekno - 1 returns 0 and i want it to return 52. ..so, it should be something like this,..int lastweekno = lastweek(datetime.today);  //returns 52 for today's date, 1 for next monday's date,.....let me know how can i achieve this. any ideas will be appreciated...thanks."
