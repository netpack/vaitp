"how do i compare two objects' properties? how do i compare the properties of two objects to determine if any properties have changed? i have a patient object with a series of properties. i have a second object, updatedpatient, that may have different values. currently, i'm using the following for each property:..if (expt.id!= pt.id).{.    expt.id = pt.id;.    patientchanged = true;.}...after all the properties are checked, if the patientchanged flag is true, the patient is updated. yes, it works but i'm questioning if this if the most efficient solution."
