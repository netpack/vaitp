focus event on linklabel- blank i'm new in blank. is there a code. when i point the mouse pointer on a specific 'linklabel'. it will do some function. for example. when i point the mouse pointer on a specific linklabel. its forecolor will change. but when i leave the mouse pointer it will back to normal. can you give me a simple code for that? thank you!
