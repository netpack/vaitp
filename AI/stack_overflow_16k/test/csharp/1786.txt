"populating data to a nested dictionary collection i have a collection .list&lt;employee&gt; which contain properties like..name ,employeeid,address,jobtitle and so on ..for every employee there are few column which changes and based upon these few columns i need to update my active directory...so i thot of creating a iseditable field for each column which will signify whether the column has changed or not for a particular employee . but it turns out that i need to create this field for all the columns and the number of columns also changes frequently ...so i came up with nested dictionary collection .. dictionary&lt;int, dictionary&lt;object, bool&gt;&gt;...which will store the employee id as the key and the object type will store all the column names and bool by default will be false ..but i don't know how to populate the above nested collection with list&lt;employee&gt; collection ...this is what i have tried till now ..dictionary&lt;int, dictionary&lt;object, bool&gt;&gt; _iseditable = new dictionary &lt;int, dictionary&lt;object, bool&gt;&gt;();..foreach (var item in _empcoll ).{.   foreach (var type in _empcoll .gettype ().getproperties ()).   {.       _iseditable.add  (item.employeeid ,dict.add (type.name,false));.   }.}...but its throwing error .i'm trying to get the metadata (column names ) from the _empcoll for each employeeid"
