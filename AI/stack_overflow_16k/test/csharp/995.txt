"one of my classes is returning a wrong value i an using blank...i have 9 classes in total...3 classes are abstract classes, and the rest are concrete classes...each of those class is supposed to return area and volume (for three-dimensional shapes)...all classes are working fine except the cube class, which is returning 0...i changed from using the variable to using property, but still, i was getting 0...my test class looks like this:..shape[] shapes =.        {.            new sphere (""a sphere is a sphere"", 10),.            new cube (""a cube is a cube"", 10),.            new tetrahedron (""tetrahedron is a tetra"", 10),.            new circle (""a circle is a circle"", 10),.            new triangle (""a triangle is a triangle"", 10, 10),.            new square (""a square is a square"", 10),..        };.        foreach (shape s in shapes).        {.            console.writeline ( s );.        }...my cube class looks like this:..class cube : threedimensionalshape.{.    private double side; //holds side value..    public cube ().    {..    }.    public cube (string desc, double s ).        :base (desc).    {.        side = side;.    }..    public double side.    {.        get.        {.            return side;.        }.        set.        {.            if (value &lt; 0).            {.                console.writeline ( ""side of cube must be greater or equal to 0"" );.            }.            else.            {.                side = value;.            }.        }.    }.    public override double area.    {.        get.        {.            return 6 * ( side * side ); //return cube area.        }.    }.    public override double volume.    {.        get.        {.            return system.math.pow (side, 3);.        }.    }..}...my output looks like this:..a sphere is a sphere.area = 314.159265358979.volume = 523.598775598299..a cube is a cube.area = 0.volume = 0..tetrahedron is a tetra.area = 173.205080756888.volume = 117.851130197758..a circle is a circle.area = 314.159265358979..a triangle is a triangle.area = 50..a square is a square.area = 100"
