"how do i reference object being initialized in the initializer with blank? suppose i have an object initializer similar to the following:..var coolobject = new coolobject().{.    getobjectstate = () =&gt; coolobject.internalstate;.}...where getobjectstate is a function on coolobject that returns some kind of object state. in this case, i'd like that function to simply return the coolobject's internal state object. the code object clearly won't compile because you can't reference a local variable before it's declared...is there a way around this? is there something similar to the ""this"" keyword for initializers?"
