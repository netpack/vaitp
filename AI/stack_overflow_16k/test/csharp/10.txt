"highlight an option in the listview i created a listview programmatically. i set the fullrowselect option as true. after adding the elements to the listview, if i start selecting the items, the row which is.currently selected is highlighted with a blue color. how can i disable the highlighting? i want to stop the highlighting of an item on its selection, but want fullrowselect to be true...also, if i select an item, i want to change the color of the item so that anyone can easily identify which item is selected."
