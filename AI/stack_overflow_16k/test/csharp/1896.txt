"displaying user input from array blank i have just starting and i am new to programming. i am doing an exercise where i have to ask the user  for the rainfall  for each month over a period of years of his or hers own choosing.the program needs to show the total rainfall for the year and the average rainfall per month. i am stuck on 2 things,..1st is how do i get the loop to recognize the amount of the years the user has entered (eg): if he or she enters 2 years that after year one year  the 2nd starts.at the minute it is only running for 1 year...2nd problem i have is,at the end of the year i can't seem to get the totals the user has entered for each month to display.how can i get these from the array.i have attached my coding below. any help i could get on this is very much appreciated,thanks..namespace rainfall.{.    class program.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.            int numyears = 0;.            //int month = 12;.            double rainfall = 0.0;.            double avrrainfall = 0.0;.            string[] month = { ""jan"", ""feb"", ""mar"", ""apr"", ""may"", ""jun"", ""jul"", ""aug"", ""sep"", ""oct"", ""nov"", ""dec""}; ..            console.writeline(""please enter number of years"");.            numyears = int.parse(console.readline());..            while(numyears &lt;= 0).            {  .                console.writeline(""minimum number of years is 1 please re-enter"");.                numyears = int.parse(console.readline());.            }..            for(int i = 0; i &lt; month.length; i ++).            { .                console.writeline("" enter inches of rainfall for {0}"", month[i]);.                console.readline(); .            }..            for (int i = 0;i &lt; month.length; i++).            {.                console.writeline("" {1} total;"", i + 1, month[i]);.            }.        }.    }.}"
