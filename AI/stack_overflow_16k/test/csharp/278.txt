"how to get property that is a class itself value within a class methode i want to create some classes, that have to look a certain way ( the way shown in my example)..some of the class properties are classes (or structs) themselves..i want to write a method within my classes that get the property-values of all the properties, that are structs and write them to a string...so this is what my classes look like:..public class car.{.   public string brand { get; set; }.   public tire _id { get; set; }.   public string getattributes().   {.      type type = this.gettype();.      propertyinfo[] properties = type.getproperties();.      foreach(propertyinfo propertyinfo in properties).      if (propertyinfo.propertytype.tostring().contains(""_"")).      {.         //i want to write the actual value of the property here!.         string nested_property_value = ....         return nested_property_value;.      }.   }.}...this is what my structs look like:.. public struct tire. {.    public int id { get; set; }. }...this would be the main program:..tire mynewtire = new tire().{.   id = 5.};..car mynewcar = new car().{.   _id = mynewtire.};...anyone has an idea how to create the getattributes-methode? i've been trying to figure this out for ages now, but don't get there..."
