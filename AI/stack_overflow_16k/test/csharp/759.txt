"explain a statement in blank i am working my way through a book called head first blank. it doesnt explain what the loop is saying in detail. it would be great if someone can explain the part i dont understand..the way i am reading this is as long as c is less than 254 and visible c will increase by 1 each time the loop is gone through. what i dont understand is the (c, 255 - c, c)..private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {..        while (visible).        {.            for (int c = 0; c &lt; 254 &amp;&amp; visible; c++).            {.                this.backcolor = color.fromargb(c, 255 - c, c);.                application.doevents();.                system.threading.thread.sleep(5);.            }.        }.    }"
