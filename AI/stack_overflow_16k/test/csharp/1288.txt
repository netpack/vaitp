"is it possible to compare multiple values with one field? my question may not make much sense, so let me reiterate..let's say i have code that looks like so:..int value = 4;.if (value == 4 || value == 8 || value == 12) {.    dosomething();.}...would it be possible to compare 4, 8, and 12 to value without rewriting ""value =="", such as:..if (value == (4 || 8 || 12)) {.    dosomething();.}"
