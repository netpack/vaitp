"what is the best way to run some in another location as if it was at a certain location? instead of running a code in a initialize() method for example, i want to just write a line, something like somecode.run() and it will run everything for me, allowing me to write all the code in a different location for the sake of organization...i want the code to act like it was in that spot though, so i have access to privates etc...whats the best way to do this?..edit to clarify:..here is an example..public class game.{.    public void initialize().    { .     i want to run some code here but i don't want to write it here, .     i want to write it in another file for the sake of organization,.     and just  reference it somehow here, but yet still be able to use the.     privates as if it was in this spot.    }.}"
