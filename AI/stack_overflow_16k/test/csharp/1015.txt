"delegate loop not changing behavior between blank 5 and blank 4 version as per text book i have another fairly unimportant theory question but i was hoping to find clarity on this anyhow. as per a text book i have, it states the the following code should have different results from blank version 4 to blank version 5:..    static void main(string[] args).    {.        var values = new list&lt;int&gt; { 10, 20, 30 };.        var funcs = new list&lt;func&lt;int&gt;&gt;();.        foreach (var value in values).        {.            funcs.add(() =&gt; value);.        }.        foreach(var f in funcs).        {.            console.writeline((f()));.        }.        console.readkey();.    }...according to the material i have, in blank version 4, 30 should be written to the console 3 times due to the following:...  with blank 4 the compiler defines the loop variable outside of the while.  loop and reuses it with every iteration. thus, at the end of the loop.  the variable has the value from the last iteration....and in blank 5, the values 10, 20, 30 should be written to the console however, despite changing the blank version (i'm definitely changing the language version and not the .net framework (although i've tried that as well)) both version write 10, 20, 30 to the console...i realize this isn't very important but i'm just wondering why this is as it might be something i'm doing wrong and could influence other tests that i try between language versions of blank."
