"blank how to treat ints like they are array? let's say i have 5 int's which are not an array! and i want to change them all in 1 loop. is there any way to make an array which will get the values of those 5 numbers and could change them directly?..something like:..int a = 10;.int b = 20;..int[] rihanna = // .... ? ..for(int a=0; a&lt;rihanna.length;a++).    rihanna[a]++;..console.writeline(""{0} {1} "",a,b) // what i want to see here is 11 and 21"
