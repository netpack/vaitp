"which will cause more cpu utilization (blank) i am developing a application (blank 3.5) which executes multiple parallel jobs. when i tried one or 2 jobs in parallel the cpu utilization is less like 2%. but when i run 50 jobs in parallel the cpu utilization is fine for some 20 minutes (less than 10%)...but it suddenly increased to 99% and pc hangs. i am using db operation and linq operations. if you can give some idea, that can light me up in tuning my application...and also is there any .net tools which identifies potential cpu utilization code?..i know its weird to ask just like that which will cause more cpu utilization...edit:..for a single job the cpu utilization is not increasing. but it happens with multiple jobs only. i donno which causes more cpu utilization. any help is appreciated."
