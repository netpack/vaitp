"asynchronous capture from a process output not working properly i'm developing a control for a website, where user can upload his pdf, and after the upload a 3rd party cli-tool launches to verify pdf against certain profile and generate a corresponding report..the tool mentioned is callas pdftoolbox 4 (available here http://www.callassoftware.com/callas/doku.php/en:download[^])..the problem is that on my control at the website i need to display in real-time progress bar of checking the pdf-file. all the ajax-stuff for this functionality is already written (ajax-postbacks, updates of progress-bar, etc), but there's a problem with asynchronous updates from the process, which launches the pdf-checking tool...if you launch the tool from command-line window, you can see that, it generates output into standard output stream, which contains progress updates (in percents), as well as possible messages about errors in the pdf-file...however, if the tool is launched by the process which i create in my web-control, i don't receive the outputdatareceived events until the check has been finished, and then many outputdatareceived events come at once, one after one...my code is the following (i've written a small console-app to test things faster):..class program.{..        static string appstring = ""path-to-callas-cli"";.        static string argstring = ""path-to-pdf-and-path-to-report-and-path-to-callas-profile"";..         static void main(string[] args).        {.             processstartinfo pinfo = new processstartinfo(appstring, argstring);.            pinfo.useshellexecute = false;.            pinfo.createnowindow = true;.            pinfo.redirectstandardoutput = true;.            pinfo.redirectstandarderror = true;.            pinfo.redirectstandardinput = true;.            pinfo.errordialog = true;..            process process = new process();.            process.startinfo = pinfo;.            process.outputdatareceived += new datareceivedeventhandler(process_outputdatareceived);.            process.exited += new eventhandler(process_exited);.            process.errordatareceived += new datareceivedeventhandler(process_errordatareceived);.            process.start();..            process.beginoutputreadline();.            process.beginerrorreadline();..            process.waitforexit();..            console.readkey();.        }..        static void process_errordatareceived(object sender, datareceivedeventargs e).        {..        }..        static void process_exited(object sender, eventargs e).        {.        }..        static void process_outputdatareceived(object sender, datareceivedeventargs e).        {.            console.writeline(""received async output: "" + e.data);.        }.}...as i've said, all the output from callas cli comes at once in the end (while the check takes about 35 seconds). to test my own code, i've created a small console app, which outputs numbers 10-20-30-....-100 in 500 milli-second intervals, and it's output is displayed perfectly from the main app, coming with 500ms intervals...any ideas?"
