"cannot group by year, month and date blank i would like to know how i can group dates by year, month and date respectively...so far i managed to group by month and date, however i am getting some trouble understanding to group b a year..so, i created several classes that represent day, month and year:..public class day.{    .    public datetime date { get; set; }.}..public class month.{.    public int monthnumber { get; set; }.    public list&lt;day&gt; days { get; set; }.}..public class year.{.    public int yearnumber { get; set; }.    public list&lt;month&gt; months { get; set; }.}...so first i got a range of dates overall and add them to list of days...var startdate = datetime.parse(""12/08/2019"");.var enddate = datetime.parse(""01/03/2020"");.var days = new list&lt;day&gt;();.var months = new list&lt;month&gt;();.var years = new list&lt;year&gt;();.if (enddate &gt;= startdate).{.    for (var date = startdate; date &lt;= enddate; date=date.adddays(1)).    {.        var daymodel = new day();.        daymodel.date = date;.        days.add(daymodel);.    }.}...then i tried to group days by months and add them to list of months:..var grouppedmonths = days.groupby(y =&gt; y.date.month).tolist();..foreach (var month in grouppedmonths).{.    var monthmodel = new month();.    monthmodel.days = month.select(d =&gt; d).tolist();.    months.add(monthmodel);.}...after groupping by months i want to group actual result by the year..i tried something like this:..var grouppedyears = months.groupby(x =&gt; x.days.select(y =&gt; y.date.year));...but it did not work for me..overall i want to get ...list of years...that contain list of months...that contain list of days."
