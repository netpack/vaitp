"i am trying to arrange strings in alphabetical order that user inputs randomly, but nothing shows i am trying to do this using the string.compare() method and my conditions are that if the methods finds out that the upcoming word is alphabetically behind the current word, their position changes with the help of the temporary string strwordtemp. ..the code seems fine, and when the last number is reached, i have written another block of code to make sure that it is being compared with the word behind it instead of in front of it. all seems good, but when i want this to show, nothing shows. the screen is blank, no errors show either. ..for (int inti = 0; inti &lt; strwordlist.length; inti++).{.    while (inti != strwordlist.length).    {.        intcomparison = string.compare(strwordlist[inti], strwordlist[inti + 1]);.        if (intcomparison &gt; 0).        {.            strwordtemp = strwordlist[inti];.            strwordlist[inti] = strwordlist[inti + 1];.            strwordlist[inti + 1] = strwordtemp;.        }.    }.    if (inti == strwordlist.length).    {.        intcomparison = string.compare(strwordlist[inti - 1], strwordlist[inti]);.        if (intcomparison &gt; 0).        {.            strwordtemp = strwordlist[inti - 1];.            strwordlist[inti - 1] = strwordlist[inti];.            strwordlist[inti] = strwordtemp;.        }.    }.}..for (int inti = 0; inti &lt; strwordlist.length; inti++).{.    system.console.writeline(""word #"" + (inti + 1) + "" is: "" + strwordlist[inti]);.}"
