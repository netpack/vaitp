"how salve printdocument without confirm dialog? note: the other questions have not solved my problem...iâ€™ve got an printdocument object type and i would like to save its content in pdf format..within the object already exists the .print () method, however when running this method shows up a box asking where to save the file. instead, i need to save the generate file in a specific directory, without the need for the user to choose the name and location for the file...ps..i tried to perform the procedure:how to skip the dialog of printing in printdocument.print() and print page directly?.but can not. we came to create a file in the folder set with that name set, however the file creates empty and still appears the dialog box."
