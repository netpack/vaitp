"making http call from blank there is a classic asp application which makes calls to .shtml files using asphttp.conn. it makes the request by appending all the input and also reads the response by reading the values in the response by length..here is the example..strmessage= ""test.shtml"".set httpobj = server.createobject(""asphttp.conn"").httpobj.url = url &amp; strmessage.httpobj.postdata = ""testarea="" &amp; strrequestdata.httpobj.timeout = 60.httpobj.requestmethod = ""post"".strresponsedata = httpobj.geturl..response.write  mid(strresponsedata,3,1).response.write  mid(strresponsedata,4,3)...if i need to rewrite this, what will be the best way to do this. i will be using mvc and will be rewriting the ui. what will be the best approach to make httpcall from blank?.  the backend to which the request will be sent will not be changed. please suggest."
