"export to .ppt file using microsoft.office.interop.powerpoint is very slow i have a dashboard application and i need to export all its tabs (around 30 chart images and data tables) into powerpoint file. i am using ""microsoft.office.interop.powerpoint"" assembly. this is working fine but it is taking too much time around 5 minutes. i have to export the file within 30 seconds. can it be possible? is there any other api which runs faster than this. i have heard about open xml but never used. can it be useful here. i also have used parallel in blank but that is not giving proper result. .any help will be appreciated."
