"referencing a blank object by calculation i have 8 picture boxes, named p1 through p8...i would like to change the backcolor of one of those picture boxes, depending on the result of a calculation...i can create a string beginning with the letter 'p' and affix the calculated number to that string...i am looking for a clever way to reference a picture box with this string (eg. ""p4""). my question is, is this possible?"
