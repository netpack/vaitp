"what means the local _ in blank? first of it all: my blank knowledge is depricated because i do other projects in the meantime..so i come back and see whats up now, but there is one thing i do not understand...this is now valid in blank.._ = new object();...i try to use a search engine of my choice but u can imagine search for ""blank _"" isnt very helpful to search for. can someone explain whats going on here? my idea was this is placeholder to pop the result back on the stack and avoid agressive compiler optimization. but at the end, i have no idea."
