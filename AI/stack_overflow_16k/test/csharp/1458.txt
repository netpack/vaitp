"does checking against null for 'success' count as ""double use of variables""? i have read that a variable should never do more than one thing.  overloading a variable to do more than one thing is bad.  ..because of that i end up writing code like this:  (with the customerfound variable)..bool customerfound = false;.customer foundcustomer = null;.if (currentcustomer.isloaded).{.    if (customeridtofind = currentcustomer.id).    {.        foundcustomer = currentcustomer;.        customerfound = true;.    }.}.else.{.    foreach (customer customer in allcustomers).    {.        if (customeridtofind = customer.id).        {.            foundcustomer = customer;.            customerfound = true;.        }.    }.}.if (customerfound).{.    // do something.}     ...but deep down inside, i sometimes want to write my code like this: (without the customerfound variable)..customer foundcustomer = null;.if (currentcustomer.isloaded).{.    if (customeridtofind = currentcustomer.id).    {.        foundcustomer = currentcustomer;.    }.}.else.{.    foreach (customer customer in allcustomers).    {.        if (customeridtofind = customer.id).        {.            foundcustomer = customer;.        }.    }.}.if (foundcustomer != null).{.    // do something.}...does this secret desires make me an evil programmer?..(i.e. is the second case really bad coding practice?)"
