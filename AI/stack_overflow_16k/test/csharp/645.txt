"barcode number representation i'm creating a barcode application and when i google to know about barcode i found something that i did not understand and it is the odd left, even left and right digits for example the ean-13 barcode includes the following..oddleft = new string[] { ""0001101"", ""0011001"", ""0010011"", ""0111101"",.                                          ""0100011"", ""0110001"", ""0101111"", ""0111011"",.                                          ""0110111"", ""0001011"" };..evenleft = new string[] { ""0100111"", ""0110011"", ""0011011"", ""0100001"",.                                           ""0011101"", ""0111001"", ""0000101"", ""0010001"",.                                           ""0001001"", ""0010111"" };..right = new string[] { ""1110010"", ""1100110"", ""1101100"", ""1000010"",.                                        ""1011100"", ""1001110"", ""1010000"", ""1000100"",.                                        ""1001000"", ""1110100"" };...where every string within the string array represents a number from 0 to 9..how can decimal 0 equals ""0001101"" in odd left or ""0100111"" in even left or ""1110010"" in right. how did they calculate it?.i know the binary representation of decimal 0 and none of the 3 representations above represents a binary represetation of decimal 0..i read about parity bits too and i found the none of the 3 representations above represents odd or even parity bits of decimal 0...is those representations above are standard fixed representation? or there is a way or a calcuation performed to obtain such representation?"
