"autosized panel which includes autosized panel shrinks to void i have 2 items flowlayoutpanel each includes some buttons and has autosize property. then i have a simple panel docked to left. my flowlayotpanels docked inside that panel one to top, second to bottom. i dont want to set static width to docked to left panel, but if i set autosize to that panel, it shrinks to zero. somehow it doesnt ""see"" sizes of autosized flowlayoutpanenls inside of it...how to force panel to see size of flowlayoutpanel inside?"
