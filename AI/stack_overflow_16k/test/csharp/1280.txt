"compile to library other than dll here is one question which i asked was.compile to intermediate type..the problem was solved of adding dll into my exe...problem:.my next problem to this is, these libraries are big in size so i don't think it is feasible to do so. but in my project very few methods of those dlls are being used..question:.is there any alternative present for not passing dll to end user and also not merging dll to exe, like compile to some intermediate file type which can be used in other project and only those parts(functions) are compiled with exe which are needed(used)."
