"how do i cast between different data types ok, before i ask for some help with the issue i'm having at hand, i've googled and i've read through many links on other sites like this one. i'm trying to figure out variables using my hungarian notation. so please don't flag or dislike my post i'm really needing some experts help here...i've done a few already but i honestly don't know if i've done it right. but i'm really trying to attempt them i just don't have anyone else to turn to for help other than here call me a noob but i've been trying to figure these out for about 3 days now...sites i've used in trying to figure it out are -...hungarian notation.casting and type conversions (blank programming guide).-i would post more but the system wont let me post any more links..... intnum1 =30. dblnum2=45.3. strnum3=”88”. text box named txtnum4. intnum5 = 0....correct the following statements with the correct casting...txtnum4.text = intnum1;.strnum3 = txtnum4.text;.dblnum2 = intnum1;.intnum1 = dblnum2;.txtnum4.text = dblnum2 * 2;.intnum1 = txtnum4.text;.dblnum2 = txtnum4.text;.txtnum4.text = dblnum2 * 2;.txtnum4.text = “the value is “ + dblnum2;.modify the previous casting to display dblnum2 as currency....here's what i've done so far if i'm doing them wrong say so because i have no clue i usually learn with visual aids but i have nothing...int intnum1 = 30;.txtnum4.text = intnum1.tostring();..string strnum3 = ""88"";.strnum3 = txtnum4.text;..double dblnum2 = 45.3;.dblnum2 = (double)intnum1;..int intnum1;.double dblnum2 = 45.3;.intnum1 = (int)dblnum2;..txtnum4.text = (dblnum2 * 2).tostring();...doc that i got the info from ..assume you have following variables using my hungarian notation as a datatype hint:..1. intnum1 =30 .2. dblnum2=45.3.3. strnum3=”88”.4. assume you have a text box named txtnum4 .5. intnum5 = 0...although the text and.strings hold numbers, they are not values but rather characters. correct the following statements by adding the correct casting.  if no casting is needed indicate so:..1.  txtnum4.text = intnum1;.2.  strnum3 = txtnum4.text;.3.  dblnum2 = intnum1;.4.  intnum1 = dblnum2;.5.  txtnum4.text = dblnum2 * 2;.6.  intnum1 = txtnum4.text;.7.  dblnum2 = txtnum4.text;.8.  txtnum4.text = dblnum2 * 2;.9.  txtnum4.text = “the value is “ + dblnum2;.10. modify the previous problem to display dblnum2 as currency."
