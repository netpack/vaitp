"how would i get a little piece of html code out of a string? blank i am trying to get a select html field out of my blank application...the html that can come in are as follows.....&lt;html&gt;.    &lt;body bgcolor=""#123456""&gt;.        hello.    &lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;...this html can change anytime, the part of the html i want is the value for bgcolor e.g. #123456..or it could be ""white"", or ""red"", etc.....how can i do this?..i don't think substring would work as i can't predict how long the field would be...thanks"
