"is there a way to organize my functions into subclasses or some form of nested container? so i'm trying to organize my functions into nested classes so i can call them like: ""player.trigger_functions.takedamage()"" rather than calling it as such: ""player.takedamage()"". i suppose it is a less efficient way to call the functions the way i'm suggesting but it would help separate the functions into distinct categories while remaining on the same file...here is some test code but i can't get it to compile online to see if it works..(some of the functions need to be able to interact with each-other despite being in separate containers which i think is a problem)..using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;...public class program.{.    public class meme{..        public int thicc = 0;..        public oof nest1 = new oof();.        public watermelone nest2 = new watermelone();..        public class oof : meme.        {..            public void here(){.            thicc++;.            }.            public void call(){.                 nest2.here();.                 system.console.writeline(""oof"" + thicc);.            }..        }..        public class watermelone : meme.        {..            public void here(){.                thicc++;.            }.            public void call(){.                 nest1.here();.                 system.console.writeline(""watermelone"" + thicc);.            }..        }....}....public static void main(){.            meme me = new meme();..            me.nest1.call();//adding 1.            me.nest2.call();//adding 1.            system.console.writeline(""here is the current thicc value of the me class:"" + me.thicc);...    }.}...ok yeah so this code wouldn't work at all, i didn't put that much thought into it but you get the idea of what i'm trying to accomplish."
