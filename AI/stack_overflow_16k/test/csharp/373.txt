"what is 'unverifiable code' and why is it bad? i am designing a helper method that does lazy loading of certain objects for me, calling it looks like this:..public override edc2_orm.customer customer {.    get { return lazyloader.get&lt;edc2_orm.customer&gt;(.            customerid, _customerdao, ()=&gt;base.customer, (x)=&gt;customer = x); }.    set { base.customer = value; }.}...when i compile this code i get the following warning:...  warning   5   access to member.  'edc2_orm.billing.contract.site'.  through a 'base' keyword from an.  anonymous method, lambda expression,.  query expression, or iterator results.  in unverifiable code. consider moving.  the access into a helper method on the.  containing type....what exactly is the complaint here and why is what i'm doing bad?"
