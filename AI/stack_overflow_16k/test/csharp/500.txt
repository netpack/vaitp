"can not convert ilist to list i found this method to shuffle a list but what i would like, is for it to return the new list, and i can not seem to figure out how this is done...here is what i tried..public static class lists {..    private static system.random rng = new system.random();..    public static list&lt;t&gt; shuffle&lt;t&gt;(this ilist&lt;t&gt; list) {.        int n = list.count;.        while(n &gt; 1) {.            n--;.            int k = rng.next(n + 1);.            t value = list[k];.            list[k] = list[n];.            list[n] = value;.        }.        return list;.    }.}...what it is saying is:...  can not convert ilist to list...what i want is for the method to return the new shuffled list, but i can't get it to return the list. how can this be done?"
