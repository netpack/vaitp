"request for explaining code on form's reference how can the lines mark with * in form2 be referred back to form1? .i mean when form1 is instantiated, it can only be referenced by.the name form1. but in the lines with *, form1 is used as a type.not a object. however, you can use the m_parent as reference for.form1 in the form called form2.(i hope someone may get what i was trying to ask.)..public partial class form2 : form.    {.*        private form1 m_parent;..*        public form2(form1 frm1).        {.            initializecomponent();.*            m_parent = frm1;.        }.     }..public partial class form1 : form.    {.        public form1().        {.            initializecomponent();.        }.     }"
