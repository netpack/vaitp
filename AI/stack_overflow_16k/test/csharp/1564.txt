trigger method in other class without new instance/static i am stuck in this phase of my project. i have 2 window classes...classa.//this window is like a main form which can take you to class b..classb.//this window is a search window that's suppose to set a static object in class a and fire a method `filldata()` in class a....i can't make this method static since it will require me to change a lot of variables within it's scope to static...how would you trigger the filldata() method in class a from class b without using static ? filldata() is suppose to be called when i press an ok button from classb after search...this is my 2nd week in the blank world :)
