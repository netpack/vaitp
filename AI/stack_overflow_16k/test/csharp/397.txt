"how can i optimize console.writeline (""""); it happens that i'm trying to print thousands of strings per second, but i see that my application is affected because console.writeline (""""); makes the application much slower, is there any way to optimize it?..i'm working with multi threads.in each ip address a report is printed in real time.http://i.imgur.com/3pii3hi.png.all ip addresses that access the print server..they are approximately 10,000 per second..console.writeline(""   client ["" + ip + ""]  are logged"");"
