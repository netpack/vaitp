"why doesn't the string.format work when the string is set as text of a label and displayed in a panel? i've been trying to print a formatted list of contacts in blank using labels with text that are added to the controls of a panel. everything seems to be working apart from the formatting which ideally would make the data in each row align like in a table, regardless of the length of the name of a person or their email address. the formatted padding is working when printed in the console but not in the actual windowform...this is my string that i am trying to format:..string contactstring = string.format(""{0, -50}"", allcontactsnames[i].innertext) + string.format(""{0, -15}"", ""telephone: "").                    + string.format(""{0, -30}"", allcontactstelnums[i].innertext) + string.format(""{0, -12}"", ""email: "") + string.format(""{0, -60}"", allcontactsemails[i].innertext).                    + string.format(""{0, 10}"", allcontactsid[i].innertext);...the outcome in the console:..agatha k.                                         telephone:     7466931202                    email:      aga@tha.com                                                          .me                                                telephone:     02013645896                   email:      dam@w.pl                                                             .reception                                         telephone:     102                           email:      reception@offices.uk...the outcome in the panel:....i've tried calculating the length of each contact's name and subtracting that from the desired padding so that the total number of characters would be fixed but it didn't work either. what can i do to achieve what's in the console?"
