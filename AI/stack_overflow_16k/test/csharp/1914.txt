"should i be concerned about message size when publishing events? we are using the cab event system for messaging across our application. we have a case where we publish a message to open a file, and pass along an openfileargs object containing data about the file, such as id, file name, extension, etc. this object does not include in the actual byte array of data for the file...our code that receives these messages uses the data to obtain the actual file bytes from the database, and does something with it (save, open, etc)...i am considering including the actual file byte array in the data object we publish so we don't need to make a second call to the database to obtain it. the only concern i can think of with this is it may increase the size of the data object used by the cab event system...is the size of the objects published using the cab event system (or something similar since i know cab is effectively dead) something i should be concerned about? i have tried looking around for best practices regarding this, but my google-fu is failing me today."
