"why blank standard message loop doesn't heavily increase cpu usage so far i learned that, a standard message loop in blank looks like this:..while(getmessage(&amp;msg, null, 0, 0)).{ .   translatemessage(&amp;msg); .   dispatchmessage(&amp;msg); .}...but what i'm wondering is, how it keeps the cpu usage low and the responsive time is fine(in a windows form scenario) ?.is it because it sets the thread with a low priority or something else ?"
