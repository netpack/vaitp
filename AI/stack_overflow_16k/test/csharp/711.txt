"how to store result of math equation to another variable i'm trying to write a program to find the highest common factor(hcf) (or greatest common denominator) and lowest common multiple(lcm) of 2 input numbers. ..the issue i have is that i'm trying to use the hcf as part of my calculation to find the lcm, but am unable to store it properly into a separate variable. code is below; the problem part that i know is the issue is right at the very end but i don't know the workaround. any advice would be much appreciated, thanks...using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;.using system.threading.tasks;..namespace exercised.{.    class question2.    {.        static void main().        {.            console.writeline(""please enter a number a: "");.            double a = convert.todouble(console.readline());.            console.writeline(""please enter a number b: "");.            double b = convert.todouble(console.readline());.            double x = 0;..            while (a &gt; b).            {.                a = a - b;.                while (b &gt; a).                {.                    b = b - a;.                }.            }..            while (b &gt; a).            {.                b = b - a;.                while (a &gt; b).                {.                    a = a - b;.                }.            }..            if (a == b).            {.                console.writeline($""the hcf of a and b is: {a}"");.                x = a;.                console.writeline($""the lcm of a and b is: {a * b / x}"");.            }.        }.    }.}"
