"find all character after n match until next n match i have a long string. from this i need to find a part of string and also cut them after a certain characters. for better understanding i have added code example also with output i want from this string. ..string mystr = ""/netgear-n300-wifi-range-extender/dp/b00l0ylruw/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=0606449104899&amp;amp;qid=1548142454&amp;amp;sr=8-1"";...so basically i need to find the character by /dp/ and grab after this until i find next /. this is the main pattern i want to use to achieve my output ..//output i want like this- b00l0ylruw"
