"how to make a derived method, which takes different arguments than overriden function in blank? i have a class, something  like this:..class baseclass.{.  protected int x;.  virtual void changeparameters(int newx).  {.    this.x = newx;.  }.}..class derivedclass1 : baseclass.{.  private int a;.  private int b;.}..class derivedclass2 : baseclass.{.  private int a;.}...problem comes when i want to override changeparameters() function in derived classes, because each of them can have different number of parameters. ..so here comes the question - how can i create a virtual function, which can vary in arguments number in derived classes?..ps. i don't want to use the params keyword, because i'd much prefer the user of the class to know exactly how many parameters he has to pass to the function."
