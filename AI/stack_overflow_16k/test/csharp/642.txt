"blank odbc simple select with criteria doesn't find a match i am pretty sure i am doing everything right here, and there is some type of tricky bug behind this issue, hopefully someone could point out what i am doing wrong...all i am trying to do is select a count of rows that meet my criteria...a single column from my access database is like this - ..product reference.ahd12.osi133.so-ert1... ... ......here is a small snippet of my code - ..using (conn).{.    odbccommand command = new odbccommand(""select count(*) from product, conn).    int recordcount = (int)command.executescalar();.}...recordcount = 4572..then i try the following - ..using (conn).{.    odbccommand command = new odbccommand(""select count(*) from product where 'product reference' ='ahd12' "", conn);.    int recordcount = (int)command.executescalar();.}...recordcount = 0..as you can see, the product reference ahd12 does exist in the database, but it just doesn't seem to find it...any ideas?"
