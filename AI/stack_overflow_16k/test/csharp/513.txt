"signed using pfx file. but uac still prompts for ""unknown publisher"" i signed my installer executable with the pfx file. no error or warning was given during the signing process (i used signtool.exe in windows). when i right click the installer executable and select properties, in the ""digital signature"" tab, my company's name is correctly shown...but when i run the installer. uac kicks in shows a warning, the publisher is shown as unknown.  ..what did i miss?"
