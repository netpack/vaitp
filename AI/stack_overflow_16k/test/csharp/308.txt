"why do i have to explicitly cast a class to its interface type? tl;dr:.if list&lt;t&gt; implements icollection&lt;t&gt;, and facility implements iamahierarchynode, why can't i implicitly convert list&lt;facility&gt; to icollection&lt;iamahierarchynode&gt;?....i'm getting an error of ""cannot implicitly convert type 'foo' to 'bar'. an explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)""..here's the code:..public interface iamahierarchynode&lt;idtype&gt; {.      idtype id {.         get;set;.      }..      icollection&lt;iamahierarchynode&lt;idtype&gt;&gt; children {.         get;.      }..      iamahierarchynode&lt;idtype&gt; parent {.         get;set;.      }.}..public class network : iamahierarchynode&lt;guid&gt; {.   public list&lt;facility&gt; facilities.   {.      get;set;.   }..   // this is where it's making me do an explicit conversion. but why?.   public icollection&lt;iamahierarchynode&lt;guid&gt;&gt; children =&gt; facilities;..   public iamahierarchynode&lt;guid&gt; parent {.      get =&gt; throw new invalidoperationexception ();.      set =&gt; throw new invalidoperationexception ();.   }.}..public class facility : iamahierarchynode&lt;guid&gt; {.   public network network {.      get;set;.   }..   public guid networkid {.      get;set;.   }..   public icollection&lt;iamahierarchynode&lt;guid&gt;&gt; children {.      get =&gt; throw new notimplementedexception ();.   }..   public iamahierarchynode&lt;guid&gt; parent {.      get =&gt; network;.      set =&gt; throw new notimplementedexception ();.   }.}...here's what i've found so far in my research:..this so question is the closest i've found. the second answer there says ...  you can only convert list&lt;t1&gt; to icollection&lt;t2&gt; if the types t1 and t2 are the same. ...so i'm converting from list&lt;facility&gt; to icollection&lt;iamahierarchynode&gt;. my facility class implements iamahierarchynode, so i don't understand why they wouldn't be considered the same...sadly, this so question is a typo on the op's part. this one is in reference to explicit interface implementations and the answers there would lead me to think that i shouldn't be having a problem."
