"blank open openfiledialog is launching application i'm writing a blank program on windows 10. i have an openfiledialog control. when i run it, if i choose an excel file, the excel program comes up and covers the other windows. ..here's what's happening when excel is open:.i launch the dialog box.i single click on a file with an xlsx or xls extension.excel comes to the foreground and covers the other windows that are open, including the dialog box..i minimize excel, then click the open button on the dialog box, and everything works as it should from there on...with excel closed, clicking on the file in the dialog box does not cause excel to launch.  ..i don't see the problem with xlsm files, only xlsx or xls...private void buttonopeninput_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        // set the dialog to say the last file opened..        openfiledialog1.filename = textboxinputfile.text;.        if (textboxinputfile.text != """").        {.            openfiledialog1.initialdirectory = path.getdirectoryname(infilename);.        }..        if (openfiledialog1.showdialog() == dialogresult.ok).        {.            // if file is chosen, set the filename with directory.            // as the input filename, and display only the file name..            infilename = openfiledialog1.filename;.            textboxinputfile.text = path.getfilename(infilename);.        }.    }...i'm using microsoft.office.interop.excel in the program. could that have something to do with it?..there's no problem if i choose a word file and word is already running, or pdf, or text."
