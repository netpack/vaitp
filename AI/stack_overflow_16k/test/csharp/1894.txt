"blank production code running debug version i have the following code:..     #if (debug)..      imgpath = getdirectoryname(application.executablepath);..    #else..      imgpath = getdirectoryname(application.executablepath) + ""\images\"";..    #endif...when the code went into production (live site) , it still looked the the debug version. how is this possible? is there something during the promotion process that can indicate do release vs debug"
