"enum stubs in interfaces? i've got an enum defined in one of my enum.cs classes inside this project where these interfaces lie...i've got an interface called iphoto and in it i need to put a property called filetype because other methods in this service expect it so i want any class implementing iphoto to have this defined so they know about it...does this seem out of place or you just wouldn't do such a thing?  how would i define this then?..i mean i can't just do this:..myenum filetype;...the thing is all files have a type.  and in my concrete classes i signal that using an enum (so jpeg, etc.).  so any class implementing this needs to definitely have a filetype property somehow."
