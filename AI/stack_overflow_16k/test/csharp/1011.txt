"globalhotkey not firing any events i googled around to find a way to have a globalhotkey on my blank winform...i saw this tutorial and followed it. ..the issue i'm having now is that nothing is occurring once i press the designated key.(in this case, the ` key)..here is the class i'm using..here is the relevant code on my form1.cs..hotkey hk = new hotkey();.private void form1_load(object sender, eventargs e).{.    hk.keycode = keys.oemtilde;.    hk.windows = true;.    hk.pressed += hk_pressed;.    hk.register(this);.}..private void hk_pressed(object sender, eventargs e).{.    messagebox.show(""pressed"");.}..private void form1_formclosing(object sender, formclosingeventargs e).{.    if (hk.registered).    { hk.unregister(); }.}"
