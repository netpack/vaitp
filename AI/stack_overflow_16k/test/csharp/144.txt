"blank custom control navigation i have a bunch of custom control forms (i.e. login page, home page, etc.) that i want to be embedded within a ""main form"". every time the user navigates to another page, only the content of the ""main form"" gets changed...but the only way i can do this is to copy the contents of the custom controls and paste them into the ""main form"" - which is messy. is there a standard way of doing this type of thing?"
