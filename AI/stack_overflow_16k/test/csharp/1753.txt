"how to create blank list of all file associations(friendly application names & executables) for file type i want to create a list/dictionary of all the friendly application names and their executable paths &amp; commands for a specific file type. i've used assocquerystring but it only returns one instance value...for example:..the file type "".cs"" on my pc has got many application associations for it when i right-click on a "".cs"" file and select ""open with->"" in the context menu, like ""microsoft visual studio 2008"" &amp; ""microsoft visual studio 2010"" &amp; ""notepad"" &amp; ""wordpad""...how can i enumerate all these values into a list in blank, obviously it must be extracted from the registry, but i'm very lost in all the ""openwithlist"" and ""openwithprogids"" keys....thanks"
