"include dll into exe i am new to blank..i am not a good programmer but i have worked on some projects which were in delphi7. in delphi there is one option; compile the class files to create .dcu. those .dcu can be used without having the actual code with any other project in delphi and after build .dcu files need not no given to end user...now my actual question,..is there any way where i can create some compiled file from my blank class and use that compiled unit with some other project in blank ?..i already tried to create dll and use. nice idea, but i don't want to give any other file than configuration file and executable file. since, i created dll that needs to give with application...i also tried to create a setup of application which build executable, configuration file and dll together. while executing, it extract itself in %temp% folder and executes from there only. so, in this case i am not able to set the configuration file's values...again the same question,..is there any way where i can create some compiled file from my blank class and use that compiled unit with some other project in blank ?....please suggest the solution..thanks"
