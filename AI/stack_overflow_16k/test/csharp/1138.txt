"error : 'oitem' is a 'variable' but used like a 'method' i'm relatively new to blank coding in the .net framework. i'm using visual studios 2010. i feel like this is a simple problem but whatever i seem to try with the visibility, it doesn't work. .i want to just convert the code from vb.net to blank . it works fine on vb but when i write it into blank it gives an error. ..here is the error:  'oitem' is a 'variable'  but is used like a 'method' ..please take a look at the code and tell me what i'm overlooking. i have searched the questions of course as well as googling, but the problem is that mostly this error has to do with arrays. for me it does not...in  blank..foreach ( object oitem in modweldedcylinder.objclsweldedcylinderfunctionalclass.formnavigationorder).{. if (oitem(clsweldedcylinderfunctionalclass.eorderofformnavigationarraylist.currentformname).tostring().equals(modweldedcylinder.objclsweldedcylinderfunctionalclass.objcurrentform.name)).                {.                    form oform = null;.                    form ocurrentform = null;..        }.}...in vb.net ..for each oitem as object in objclsweldedcylinderfunctionalclass.formnavigationorder..   if oitem(clsweldedcylinderfunctionalclass.eorderofformnavigationarraylist.currentformname).tostring.equals(objclsweldedcylinderfunctionalclass.objcurrentform.name) then.            dim oform as form = nothing.            dim ocurrentform as form = nothing"
