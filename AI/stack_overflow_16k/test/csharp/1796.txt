"func<> as optional parameter of a function has to be a compile time constant? so i have the following function. i would like it to have a standard parameter value but i can't get it to work as it needs to be a compile time constant. i know i can set it to null but i want it to be a specific function...    private void func(func&lt;list&lt;int&gt;, bool&gt; eval = _ =&gt; true).    {.        var b = eval();.    }....is it even possible to something like this?"
