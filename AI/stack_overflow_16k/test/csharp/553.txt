"blank add properties at runtime i've read few posts, and i'm still having troubles with adding properties to a class in runtime. it should be simple, because i have a class like this:..public class myclass.    {.        string template;.        string term;.     }...during runtime, i have to add few attributes, like phone, email (it depends...). .could someone please explain me how to add these properties during class initialization?..srecko"
