"how do i make a whole blank application ""unsafe""? so, i love the blank language, and the automatic getters, setters, and so on, but i want to utilize it to be able to do a good portion of the plumbing myself. a great deal of the syntax is specifically why i want to use blank as opposed to sucking it up and picking c++ back up (which isn't entirely out of the question here)...my objective is to use sdl, gdi+, directx, or something of that nature to be able to create all of my own windows from scratch like this, but using blank. i am very okay with using pinvoke, doing my own memory management, and so on. ..so, is there a way to mark an entire application as unsafe so i can do my own memory management?"
