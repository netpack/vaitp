"remove duplicate line with timestamp from text file in blank i am trying to develop a software tool which can store data into log file continuously. the data is repeated and i wanted to remove all duplicate lines and store into log file. i went through couple of forums and found solution/s but that's not the one i am looking for. here is my situation:..fm radio stations broadcast a standard message during commercial break let's say ""soft rock kwav 96.9fm""  for certain period of time and after few minutes they broadcast a song with title or artist name etc. i am able to store all the information into my log file with no duplicate lines. my problem is, when song is finished there is 10 min's commercial break again, at this point of time my current log file already contained the message (""soft rock kwav 96.9 fm"" ), so it's not allowing the second repeated message into the text file. if i run my software and look at the log file at the end of the day,  there will be only one commercial break, which is not correct. ..any suggestions/ideas would be much appreciated. ..input data: ..02/15/2013, 09:12, soft..02/15/2013, 09:12, soft..02/15/2013, 09:12, soft..02/15/2013, 09:12, soft..02/15/2013, 09:12, soft..02/15/2013, 09:12, soft..02/15/2013, 09:12, rock..02/15/2013, 09:12, rock..02/15/2013, 09:12, rock..02/15/2013, 09:12, rock..02/15/2013, 09:12, rock..02/15/2013, 09:12, rock..02/15/2013, 09:12, kwav..02/15/2013, 09:12, kwav..02/15/2013, 09:12, kwav..02/15/2013, 09:12, kwav..02/15/2013, 09:12, kwav..02/15/2013, 09:12, kwav..02/15/2013, 09:12, 96.9 fm..02/15/2013, 09:12, 96.9 fm..02/15/2013, 09:12, 96.9 fm..02/15/2013, 09:12, 96.9 fm..02/15/2013, 09:12, 96.9 fm..02/15/2013, 09:12, 96.9 fm..02/15/2013, 09:13, soft..02/15/2013, 09:13, soft..02/15/2013, 09:13, soft..02/15/2013, 09:13, soft..and then next song/title/artist name and so on..."
