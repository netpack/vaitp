"blank how to subtract using a textbox on each click and show in another textbox i am wanting to subtract each time i click the subtract button, right now all it does is subtract it once. i guess it always sees the needed value as 4000 which is why it doesn't subtract it more than once because each click it retrieves the initial needed value. ..int needed = 4000;.private void subtractbtn_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        int subtract = convert.toint32(textbox_subtract.text);.        remaining = needed - subtract;.        textbox_remaining.text = remaining.tostring();..        if (remaining &lt;=0).        {.            messagebox.show(""hey it's done"");.        }.    }...for anyone who is as dumb as me here is the final code..private void subtractbtn_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        int subtract = convert.toint32(textbox_subtract.text);..        remaining = needed - subtract;.        needed = remaining;...        textbox_remaining.text = remaining.tostring();..        if (remaining &lt;=0).        {.            messagebox.show(""hey it's done"");.        }.    }"
