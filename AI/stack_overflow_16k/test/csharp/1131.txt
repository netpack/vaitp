"queue function calls to write char for char what should it do.i'm trying to write some text char for char into a textblock. i'm using this code for this:..void writetextcharforchar(string text).{.    new thread(() =&gt;.    {.        foreach(char c in text).        {.            txtdisplayappendtext(c.tostring());.            thread.sleep(rnd.next(20, 100));.        }..        thread.currentthread.abort();.    }).start();.}...the problem.the problem is that the text, of course, gets mixed when calling this method more then once. what i would need is a kind of queue or wait any how until the currently text is written to the textblock. .of curse i'm open to any other solution to get this working. thank you!"
