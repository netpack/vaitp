"how to select a substring from a string in blank efficiently i am trying to select specific string ""compression: "" value which is deflate in this case...below is the code:..static void main(string[] args).{.    var info = ""zipentry: testfile.txtn   version made by: 45n needed to extract: 45n"" + .        ""         file type: binaryn       compression: deflaten        "" + .        ""compressed: 0x35556371n      uncompressed: 0x1d626fbdbn      ..."";..    string s1 = info.substring((info.indexof(""compression:"")), .        info.length - info.indexof(""compression:"") - 1);..    var replace = s1.replace(""compression: "", """");.}...here, i am getting all the string having substring ""compression""..is there a efficient way to get only deflate of compression ?..thanks!"
