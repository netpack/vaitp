"best approach for blank web service with concurrent users i'm fairly new to blank but have experience with c++.  ..i'm looking to write a web service, that i can call from a website to pull hotel rates similar to rate comparison websites.  my question is; what is the best method to be able to deal with the concurrent loads and allow the data requests to run in the background whilst updating the user interface...basically i've all the code ready and to pull the xml data from the likes of booking.com, on a single per user basis...but want to change this way of working, to allow me to send off requests to say 10 suppliers at once, and then in the background the web service works to get the rates...the front end, will then refresh to get the latest data...any help or advice would be appreciated."
