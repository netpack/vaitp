"does splitting up one-liners cause more overhead? i'm trying to work out how people feel about one-liners, compared to splitting statements into multiple lines...for example, this blank code:..var output = regex.match(key, @""[(.*?)]"").groups[1].value;...could just as easily be written like this:..var regex = @""[(.*?)]"";.var matches = regex.match(input, regex);.var output = matches.groups[1].value;...does the 2nd snippet have extra overheads to it? or does the compiler basically turn both snippets into the same code in the end?..obviously, the 2nd snippet is easier to step-thru debug, but it also annoys me that it takes up 3 lines for some relatively simple code."
