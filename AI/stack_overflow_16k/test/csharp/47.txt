"compare two strings by ignoring certain substrings i am developing a comparison tool to compare two lines which are text strings.the condition is that,i will need to take a certain part of the substring and ignore it for comparison.so for e.g...two lines..file = .testtestfile crc = 0x0987678 date = 10/09/2015 version = 1..file = .testtestfile crc = 0x0984567 date = 11/09/2015 version = 1..if two filters are provided as crc and date,then i need to ignore the complete field and value.so crc = 0x0987678 date = 10/09/2015 will be ignored for comparison and only rest of the string will be compared and in above case will return true,as the rest of the string is same...now i can do this by searching string,removing white spaces,getting the value etc but i am looking for a solution with regular expressions to optimize my solutions.thanks."
