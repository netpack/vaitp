"button keeps opening lots of links i have made a button redirect you to a link but it keeps constantly opening it and messing up. i have made it so when you press it it start timer 1 then it redirects you, starts timer 2 and stops timer 1. but it doesn't stop it it just keeps opening loads of tabs. ..the code i am using is this..process.start(""https://mobile.twitter.com/logout"");...and i am also using threading so i can pause the thread for a bit of time"
