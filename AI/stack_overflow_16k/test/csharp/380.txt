"fast csv reader i am working on a project, which actually loads data from a csv file, processes it and then save it on the disk. for fast reading of csv data, i am using lumenworks csv reader http://www.codeproject.com/articles/9258/a-fast-csv-reader. this works fine till a limit but when i have csv with a size of 1gb or more, it takes time. is there any other way for faster csv reading?"
