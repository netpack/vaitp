"how to handle parameters right in blank? i just started using blank again and now i have a strange problem with my parameters..i tried to build a list by my self..so i have:..    class nodelist.    {.            public node firstcity { get; set; }..            public node findnode(string name).            {.                 //...stuff.            }.    }...and this:..class node.{.   public string name {get; set;}.   public node next {get; set;}.}...so, in my project i (lets say on button click) create a new nodelist..(by default i have already a few nodes in it.)..now i do this:..node n = nodelist.findnode(""test"");...and then i have another class i called tool...tool.dosomething(n , nodelist);...now the strange thing is that, when i look at nodelist, when i call the above the list is correct. the dosomething method, doesnÂ´t even call the nodelist but it changes it. ..dosomething(n, list).{.    nodelist nl = new nodelist();.    nl.add(n);.    //other stuff.}...at the point where i change the new list for some reason the other list, which is in a different class, changes too...can anyone please explain why and how i can fix this!?..edit:.this is my add method:..add(node node){.node.next = null;.            node current = firstcity;.            if (current == null).                firstcity = node;.            else.            {.                while (current.next != null).                {.                    current = current.next;.                }.                current.next = node;.            }.}"
