"remove 2 connections httpwebrequest limitation in blank i have a problem accessing a website via http 1.1 using httpwebrequest class. the request works only first two times when i start the application, and than times out. ..apparently this is all about that 2 concurrent connections limitation...so first of all, how can i remove that with code, or changing manifest?.second, how to force the use of http 1.0?.and third, that's my code:..httpwebrequest req = (httpwebrequest)webrequest.create(url); .req.cookiecontainer = memory._jar;..req.method = ""get"";.req.host = url.split(new string[] { ""//"" }, stringsplitoptions.none)[1].split('/')[0];.req.accept = ""text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8"";.req.useragent = memory._useragent;.req.headers.add(""accept-encoding"", ""gzip, deflate, sdch"");.req.headers.add(""accept-language"", ""en-us,en;q=0.8"");.req.allowautoredirect = false;.req.proxy = memory._proxy;.req.timeout = memory._timeout;..httpwebresponse resp = (httpwebresponse)req.getresponse();...i don't use concurent threads, i don't even set ""keep alive"" and the website is not https, so i imagine the request and response objects get garbage collected when they run out of scope, and that's all about it (they don't implement idisposible), but obviously that's not the case.....so what connection is being made? how it's persisted?"
