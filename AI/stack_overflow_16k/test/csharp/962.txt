"why  a.compareto(b) is equal to compareto(a,b) or a.method(b) = method(a,b)? as i am new to blank programming language i am a little confused about blank syntax...a method which can get two values to compare those two values can be written as a.compareto(b)  instead of compareto(a,b) how is it possible?..assuming that compareto returning an int the variable a is chained to int and gets compared! how?..thank you in advance."
