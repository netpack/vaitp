"how to calculate new cursor position given start position, angle and distance i'm writing a class to help with mouse movement and i can't seem to get the move with distance and angle function to work properly, it always seems to move the mouse in a 45 degree angle...public static point movedistanceangle(point start, double distance, double angle).{.    double radians = angletoradians(angle);.    int x = (int)math.round(math.cos(radians) * distance);.    int y = (int)math.round(math.sin(radians) * distance);..    return new point(start.x + x, start.y + y);.}...i'm using getcursorpos to get the point...public static double angletoradians(double angle).{.    return (math.pi / 180) * angle;.}...have i done something wrong with the maths?"
