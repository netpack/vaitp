"lastindexof() method blank question:.i need to search backwards on a string using lastindexof().the string in question is ""south dakota 1040"".need to split the state name from the 1040 system indicator..i can get the ""1040"" part of the string by itself, but can't get the state name by itself..have to go backwards since there are two spaces in the string..is there a better way to do this than what i'm looking at?"
