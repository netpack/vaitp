"google image search in blank i found this code on github. when u type someting it will search on google and show first image to u in picturebox1 - now i want to add 3-4 other picture box and i want it to show other pictures as well (like second and third - not just the first one ). my problem is i can't understand how to do it. ..try {.        this.cursor = cursors.waitcursor;.        this._lblstatus.text = ""searching..."";.        this._lblstatus.update();.        list&lt;string&gt; images_urls = t.searchforimages (this._editimagetext.text.trim());.        if (t.error == null &amp;&amp; images_urls.count &gt; 0) {.           //show first image only.           foreach (string image_url in images_urls) {.              bitmap bitmap = imageutil.loadpicture(image_url);.              if (bitmap != null) { //sometime the server refuses getting the image directly.                 image image = imageutil.resizeimage(bitmap, picturebox1, true);.                 picturebox1.image = image;.                 if (bitmap != null) bitmap.dispose();.                 break;   //show only one image...what i have tried: i deleted the break; but it just keep searching and it never stop. i want it to be like other sites ( for ex: show 5-10 pic in every page ). what should i change ? what am i doing wrong ?"
