should we use struct for data and class for behavior? in the article active record vs objects bob martin points out that:...  .  object hide data and expose behavior.  data structures expose data and has no behavior.  ...he then continues to say...  in languages like c++ and blank the struct keyword is used to describe a.  data structure with public fields....to me it looks like he is using data structure as a synonym for struct and is saying we should use the struct keyword for data and the class keyword for implementing objects with behaviour. that sounds strange because mutable structs are evil and data in most systems need to change (it would mean most data are evil)...could someone point out the flaw in my reasoning?
