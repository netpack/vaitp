"blank decimal.parse comma problems i need to parse a string to a decimal and it might be used in the uk or a european culture...if in a european culture 2,00 would be 2..however, 2,00 would be invalid in the uk culture as a comma denotes a thousand...if i use ..double.parse(""20,50"", new cultureinfo(""en-gb"")) ...it returns 2050..i would have expected this to throw an invalid exception...can anyone help?"
