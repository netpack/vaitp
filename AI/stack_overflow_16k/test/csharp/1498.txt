"blank: what are some things i need to know about opening and saving files (eg. validation) i am using the common file dialog. i think there will be many things i need to know and validate eg. file type, file exists, not enough memory etc. ..for file type, can i limit file types that can be opened using open file dialog? filter seems to still allow the user to type in a file with a different filetype. must i validate in code?..can i say that just by setting checkfileexists = true, i should not need to check again in code the file exists? ..is there a need to validate if there is a outofmemoryexception? i am thinking, if all i should be opening is small files, i can get away with not handling that? not a good practice i guess?..are there any others i missed out?"
