"is there something like the conditional operator but for expressions? for assignments of a value to a varbiable, i can use the following:..classname = special ? ""test"" : """";...but what if i instead want to call a function only if special is true? i have tried..special?classnameistest() : classnameisnottest();...but that does not work. is there something like this? or should i just keep using ..if(special) classnameistest();.else classnameisnottest();"
