"how to make appointed row in listview focused now i am using listview in a winform application. the appliation will read records from the database and show it in listview. there are maybe 100 rows sorted by some principle in the listview. now if i want to make 36th row selected(the whole row will be in blue color), i have to scroll the bar and find the row and make it selected. how can i make it auto selected when the form is shown? is there any method to make the listview scroll to appointed line? thank you."
