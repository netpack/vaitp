how to assigning a value into task<eventcallback> type field forgive me if this is a stupid question but this is what i want if possible. i want to assign a method or function into a field of another class of type task...i have a code something like this..public class class1 {.    public async task showdataasync() {.        //some code here.    }.}..class1 class1 = new class1();...public class class2 {.    public task&lt;eventcallback&gt; somethingasync { get; set; }.}..class2 class2 = new class2 ();.class2.somethingasync = class1.showdataasync;...visual studio is complaining with:.cannot convert method group 'showdataasync' to non-delegate type task&lt;eventcallback&gt;. did you intend to invoke the method?
