"remove float numbers outside the range and keep numbers inside the range in textfile first of all, i have a set of random float numbers in a text file, i have successfully make a code that is able to read the numbers from the text file after compilation. now i need to create a number range and remove the numbers that are outside the range from the text file and only keep the numbers within the range inside text file. lets say for example, i wanna keep only numbers that are within 743 and 1000 and remove the rest from the text file...please assist me in the matter. thank you. ..i have tried making codes which shown below, however it does not show the expected result. after compilation, my text file is empty, meaning all the numbers in the text file are removed...this is the set of random float numbers i created in text file:..743.6 .742.8.744.7.743.2.1000.1768.6.1750.1767.1780.1500...and my code:..using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;.using system.threading.tasks;.using system.io;..namespace readtextfile.{.class program.{.    static void main(string[] args)...    {..        string userspath = ""c:\users\student\desktop\consoleapp1\consoleapp1\data\textfile.txt"";..        list&lt;string&gt; lines = file.readalllines(userspath).tolist();..        streamwriter writer = new streamwriter(userspath);.        foreach (string line in lines).        {.            double x = double.parse(line);..            if (x &gt; 740.7 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 1500.6).            {.                writer.write(line);.              //console.writeline(line);..            }.            console.readline();..        }.        writer.close();..    }..}...}"
