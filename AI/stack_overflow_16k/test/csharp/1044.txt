"bufferedstream seek returns different results very strange behavior..if i create a bufferedstream on top of a file and then seek to an offset i get a block of bytes back ..if i move the debugger back to the seek and re-seek i get an extra two characters..i ve triple checked this ..can there possibly be a bug with this class ?..if i reseek back to position i expect to get the same - the file has not changed - i open it in read only mode and i seek based on origin..reproduction: ..bufferedstream.seek(100,0, 100).bufferedstream.reade(buffer, 0, 100)...is different to what you get from here..bufferedstream.seek(100,0, 100).bufferedstream.reade(buffer, 0, 100)"
