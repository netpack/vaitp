"a easier way to add in 50pictures? so i got this piece of code..namespace kortspel.{.    public partial class form1 : form..    {..        arraylist kortlek = new arraylist();.        image c1 = new bitmap(""c:/users/mert95/documents/visual studio 2012/projects/kortspel/spelkort/c1.png"");...and i don't want to add in 50pictures with a unique name such as image c2 = blablabla...some people have said i need to create a loop, to add in these 50pictures, so is there a easier way instead of adding in 50 images in the array?"
