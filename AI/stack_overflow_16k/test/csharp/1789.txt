"foreach variable error i am clearly just missing something with this..i have the following:..   list&lt;string&gt; stringlist = new list&lt;string&gt;();...i then fill it with some data and do the following:..   foreach (list&lt;string&gt; results in stringlist)...but it errors claiming that it ""cannot convert from type string to type system.generic.collections.list&lt;string&gt;"" ...but both are of type list&lt;string&gt; so where is the disconnect?  i am sure there must be something very simple i'm clearly doing wrong, but for the life of me i cannot find it."
