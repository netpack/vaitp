"check if primary key exist i have tried posting this earlier and had to delete it because the code editor did not post it correctly and incompletely. plus i had a member ask me about sql injection. ..here's the story:..i have a page where the user can check his information before it is submitted to the database. all i want to do is look to see if that primary key is present before i submit it to avoid getting a server error. ..in my page load event i have the following:..sqlconnection conn = new sqlconnection(configurationmanager.connectionstrings[""connectionstring1""].connectionstring);..sqlcommand oldcmd = new sqlcommand(""select * from dbo.registrar where [my id] = '""+id+""'"", conn);.oldcmd.commandtype = commandtype.text;..sqldataadapter da = new sqldataadapter(oldcmd);.datatable dt = new datatable();.da.fill(dt);..if (dt.rows.count &gt;= 1).{.   lblexists.visible = true;.   lblexists.forecolor = system.drawing.color.red;.   lblexists.text = ""oops! our records show that you have already signed up for this service. please check your information or contact your administrator for further assistance."";.}...the label fires even though there is no record in the database which tells me that i am doing it wrong."
