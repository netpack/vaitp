"split one list into multiple lists by divisible number i am working on a dynamic solution where i need to split one big list into x number of lists based on a variable that is passed in. ..because the classes i am working with are quite complex, in order get a minimal replicable problem i have crated the below code that represents my issue 100%. ..the issues that i am facing are a divide by 0 issue with the below code. ..other issues faced when i change if (j % i == 0) to if (j % 3 == 0) i get results of ""1"", ""4"", ""7"". ..and when i look at removing an item from the list in the if block with the change above i get ..3 new lists, and 3 items remaining in the original list. ..1, 5, 9..2, 7, ..3..4, 6, 8..void main().{.var liststosplit = 3;..var l = new list&lt;string&gt;(){.    ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"",.    ""9"".};..var dict = new dictionary&lt;int, list&lt;string&gt;&gt;();..for (var i = 0; i &lt; liststosplit; i++).{.    for (var j = 0; j &lt; l.count; j++).    {.        if (j % i == 0).        {.            list&lt;string&gt; value;..            if (dict.trygetvalue(i, out value)).            {.                value.add(l[j]);.            }.            else.            {.                var newlistitem = new list&lt;string&gt; {l[j]};.                dict.add(i, newlistitem);.            }.        }..    }.}...}..ideally what i am after out of this is .3 lists, of ..1, 4, 7..2, 5, 8..3, 6, 9...and then i'll need to mop up any remaining items after say if i have a 10 and 11. ..i have looked at ..split list&lt;string&gt; into multiple lists..and ..split list into sublists with linq..which are close to what i need, but they are not complete solutions for what i need and therefore i do not believe this is a duplicate of my issue, and would appreciate all the help possible. ..thanks..simon"
