"blank - inside instance method, why can we access static members without using the class name? this seems counter-intuitive to me. if we have a class dog with static method countalldogs(), blank forbids to call it like this: mydog.countalldogs(). (mydog is an object of type dog)..but if we are inside an instance method bark(), we can call it simply by using countalldogs(). inside the instance method bark(), the context (""this"") is the object mydog, not the class itself, so i wonder why this is allowed?"
