blank override abstract property with concrete property so i have this abstract class. which has a list of abstract types..public abstract class baseclass.{..    public abstract list&lt;a&gt; history { get; set; }...and the inheritor class. ..public class concreteclass : baseclass.{.    public override list&lt;b&gt; history { get; set; }...my question is simple. why does this return an error. a is an abstract class that b inherits. so why can't i have a concrete property override an abstract property?..note:due to other issues i cannot use generics with the base class. some clarity on the issue. i am using mvc and due to some problems with dynamic types i cannot say baseclass&lt;t&gt; and in some other areas methods that call a method called gethistory() need it to return the concrete list not the abstract list. so i am stuck between a rock and a hard place.
