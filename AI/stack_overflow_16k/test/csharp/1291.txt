"without sleeping for sometime, results returned from 3rd party function go unnoticed in loop i have a little problem with my loop structured as something like this..foreach(var item in collections).{.   //thread.sleep(1000).   var res=getprocessresultfromanotherlib(item);.   if(null!=res).   {.      //do something.   }.   else.   {.      throw new exception(""something wrong"");.   }.   listtostoreresult.add(res);.}...getprocessresultfromanotherlib execution time depends on what the input item is, and the code above does not throw any exception while running. but the listtostoreresult will never have the correct number of required results (some res are lost or skipped in the loop)..if i happen to use either thread.sleep(1000) or messagebox.show(""i'm taking your time now."") as in the comment code above, then listtostoreresult will store exactly what i want."
