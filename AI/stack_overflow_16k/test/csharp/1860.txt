choosing the right data type vs casting i am trying to learn to write good blank code and i want your advice. ..if i have for example an unsigned number value that is smaller than 255 so this value fits in the byte type. but this value will not be used as byte but as an int to set the combobox index so it will needs casting...my question is how much do i have to worry about data types when writing good blank code? do i need to declare this value as an int to avoid casting?..thank you for your time.
