"blank new keyword to override access modifier on a property from a 3rd party lib i'm using a 3rd party lib with the following class: .. class base {.    protected int count { get; }. }...i inherit from this class in my code, however, i would like count to be a public property. is the following considered bad in any way? are there other ways to do it?.. class derived : base {.    public new int count { get { return base.count; } }. }"
