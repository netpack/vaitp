"blank convert substring with no value to 0 using blank, i need to convert a substring to an int even if the value of the substring is null. ..my code reads lines of a text file and then assigns certain parts of the text to strings. ..int _custbal = convert.toint32(line.substring(5, 2));...example text:..12345 10 etc.12346 20 etc.12347 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   etc..the issue i'm having is that if the line contains a blank space it throws an exception.  i need it to return zero if the substring contain a blank.  for example.  if the text is formatted blank9 then i need to return 09.  i've tried using nullable types but that doesn't do the trick.  thanks"
