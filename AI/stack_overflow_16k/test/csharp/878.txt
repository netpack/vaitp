"the type or namespace name does not exist - folders in blank i'm sure there is a simple solution to this problem, but it has defeated me so far. basically all i'm trying to do is include some classes in a separate folder in my blank project..strangely this has been working just fine until today...in the solution explorer i created a new folder called animations. .i added the line to the main class:..using animationeditor.animations; (animationeditor is the solution name/namespace)..which throws the error:..error   1   the type or namespace name 'animations' does not exist in the namespace 'animationeditor' (are you missing an assembly reference?)..as i said, i didn't have this error before today so i am a little confused."
