"iterate through multiples of 3 with nested for loop i have a nested for loop in which 'j' represents the line number and 'i' represents the multiples of 3 below 1000...i want it to display the line number then the multiple. for example:..1 3.2 6.3 9.4 12.....333 999...right through to multiple 999..but it just dosent display the right line numbers and the multiples keep looping until the line numbers reach 999..console.bufferheight = 4000;.for (int j = 1; j &lt; 1000; j++).{.    for (int i = 3; i &lt; 1000; i++).    {.        console.writeline(j + "" "" + i);                   .    }      .}.console.readline();"
