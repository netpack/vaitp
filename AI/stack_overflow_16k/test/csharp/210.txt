"static constructor is not called i have the following class:.. private static class nativesomewrapper.   {.       [dllimport(nativemethods.myceelib, entrypoint = ""get_300_bars"",.           callingconvention = callingconvention.cdecl)].       [return: marshalas(unmanagedtype.sysint)].       internal static extern intptr get300bars([marshalas(unmanagedtype.sysint)] intptr assessment);.   }...and i have a static class that has responsibility to initilize the dll:..internal static class nativemethods.{.    public const string myceelib= ""myceelib.dll"";...    static nativemethods().    {.        var path = getpathtomyceelibfile();.        var err = setpath(path);.        if (err != errorcode.ok).        {.            throw new filenotfoundexception(""coulnt find myceelib file."");.        }.    }.}...the problem is that nativemethods constructor is not getting called as expected. ..how can i make sure that nativemethods static constructor is called and the path to library file is set correctly?"
