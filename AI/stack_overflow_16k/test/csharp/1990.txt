"need help getting listbox item text from secondary form to main form i have been looking all over the internet for this and have found similar, but none of it will work for me. everything i have found assumes the listbox is on the main form and not the secondary form, or the code is for an older version of blank or visual studio (i am using vs2008)...i am creating a web browser that has a button on the main form (called frmmybrowser) to open a dialog (frmbookmarks) with a listbox (lstbookmark) with bookmarked urls. i need to be able to double click on an item (the bookmarked url) and have the text pasted into the address bar (cmbaddress) of the main form. ..any help would be greatly appreciated."
