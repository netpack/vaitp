"do i need to explicitly run an if statement before a while-loop? i am fairly new to the blank language and wondered something when writing code not so long ago. when i am writing while loops, i also find asking myself do i explicitly need to check if my while condition is even needed, lets take the following code for example...while (_mylist.count &gt; 0).{.    // do some work.}...if previously written code (by other developers) i have seen them do something like this.....if (_list.count &gt; 0).{.    while (_mylist.count &gt; 0).    {.        // do some work.    }.}....which is the best practice, do i even need to do this? if so why.. can someone shine some light on this topic and let me know whats best? thanks."
