"getting file path through console blank i have a program where i want to get filepath from console, for example program asks me to type a path of file, but here is the problem i dont want to write the whole path down. i would like to eather use openfiledialog or create a text file within the solution and get path from there. here is a short code from the section:..string input;.console.writeline(""type path file: "");.input = console.readline();..string readtext = file.readalltext(input);..tree huffmantree = new tree();..// build the huffman tree.huffmantree.build(readtext);...and i already created a text.txt file within aplication, and i am making console aplication in blank. the error is that the program cant find a path name eg. text.txt but if i use whole path instead of ""input"" program works."
