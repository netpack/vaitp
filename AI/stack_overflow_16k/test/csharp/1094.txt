"how can i generate a gridview or datagrid using only blank in a command line application? i am adding on to a command line program that really just runs automatically on a server, sends a daily email with a transaction total every day...what i would like to add to the email is a datagrid or gridview like in asp.net, displaying specific company names and their totals (rather than just a total number for everyone)...i think i can figure how to get the data from the db and use it for this but i'm not sure how to put a grid together for the email body. i know i could put the html in the email body for a table but how could i populate it dynamically with information?..i've seen tutorials with web applications that will do this from an event handler, basically sending the same gridview from a web form but i would like to do this from a basic command line application alone. ..could someone point me in the right direction?..var body = ""good morning --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;yesterday, "" +.    datetime.now.adddays(-1).tostring(""dddd"") + "" "" +.    datetime.now.adddays(-1).toshortdatestring() +.    "" there were "" + count.tostring(cultureinfo.invariantculture) +.    "" payments processed with a total of "" +.    paymentamount + ""&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"" + .    ""please visit &lt;a href="""" + url + ""?date="" +.    datetime.now.adddays(-1).toshortdatestring().replace(""/"", ""-"") +.    """" title=""click here to view the transactions.""&gt;"" + url +.    ""&lt;/a&gt; to view the transactions."" + ""&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;company totals:&lt;br /&gt;"";..// create and populate a datagrid programatically for insertion into our email.body += ""grid goes here"";"
