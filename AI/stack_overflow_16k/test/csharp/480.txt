"where does google use blank looking around so user profiles and other sites, i have noticed that some high profile users who work for google including jon skeet use blank as their main programming language. or at least, it is with blank / .net related topics that they are most active..this has led me to conclude, or at least assume, that blank is widely used inside google...i was under the impression that google uses c++, php, and some other secret g-programming language only available to google insiders..all in all, i could not have imagined they use any microsoft-related tools or technologies...my question is: which google products are made using blank?"
