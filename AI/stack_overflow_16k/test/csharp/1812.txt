"what's the use case for int32.parse(string, iformatprovider) over int32.parse(string)? when would it make sense to use int32.parse(string, iformatprovider)?..as far as i can tell, this and int32.parse(string) uses numberstyles.integer anyway which only allows a plus, a minus, or digits, optionally surrounded by whitespace, so why does the locale format enter into the equation?..i know about thousand separators, but they don't matter because numberstyles.integer disallows them no matter your region."
