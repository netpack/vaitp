"try to change packet ip and send it away this is my first question here so be gentle !..recently i try to build application who can take wireshark file and send all the packet to the network, after few days of reading i found pcap.net project and after build my application (winform) i want to add advanced option like change the ip address, mac address etc.. and pcap.net support all this. .in my example after the allocate the buffer i try to change the packet ip, build new packet (with the new ip) and fill the buffer with all the packet from my file (before sending):..// allocate a send buffer.using (packetsendbuffer sendbuffer = new packetsendbuffer((uint)caplength)).{.    // fill the buffer with the packets from the file.    int numpackets = 0;.    packet packet;.    while (inputcommunicator.receivepacket(out packet) == packetcommunicatorreceiveresult.ok).    {.        ipv4layer iplayer = (ipv4layer)packet.ethernet.ipv4.extractlayer();.        iplayer.destination = new ipv4address(""11.12.13.14"");.        ethernetlayer ethernet = (ethernetlayer)packet.ethernet.extractlayer();.        payloadlayer payload = (payloadlayer)packet.ethernet.payload.extractlayer();.        packet newpacket = packetbuilder.build(datetime.now, ethernet, iplayer, iplayer, payload);.        sendbuffer.enqueue(newpacket);.        ++numpackets;.    }..    outputcommunicator.transmit(sendbuffer, issync); //transmit the queue.}...my problen is that after the line sendbuffer.enqueue(newpacket). ..i receive the following error: failed enqueueing to sendqueue..maybee somone can help me understand whats wrong ?"
