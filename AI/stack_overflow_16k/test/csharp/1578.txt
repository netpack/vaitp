generate another guid using one guid and vice versa is there a way/algorithm/method to generate a new guid (x) using our old guid (y) and then get y back whenever we want from x?  ..something similar to below answer but it shows a way to old guid(i can consider it as a string) to convert to guid but not a way back...https://stackoverflow.com/a/9386095/5887074..how can i generate a guid for a string?..p.s.: this is not related to anything security. the two guids will just be used to find records from the table. we can convert guid to string in this conversion if required.
