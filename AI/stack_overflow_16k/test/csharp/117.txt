"discard hidden file system with filesystemwatcher how to discard getting notified with files system: e.g: thumbs.db..i have this instance of filesystemwatcher:..filesystemwatcher watching = new system.io.filesystemwatcher();.watching.filter = ""*.*"";.watching.created += new filesystemeventhandler(onchanged);...in a folder of 'watching', if an image is opened, a ...  thumbs.db...file is generated. the program will get stuck with the file image. off couse, i can discard that file in onchanged but that is not elegant. how can i discard hidden or files system in the filter?..thanks in advance."
