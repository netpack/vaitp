"generating random datetime between a given datetime range - blank i have a listener which needs to be active randomly for 10 time for say 20 min in a given time period. so if the time period is say from 2013/08/20 10:00 to 2013/08/20 22:00, i need to generate a random datetime 10 times between this range keeping in mind that the listener needs a time of 20 min."
