"property is getting set to null after i set it to something? i've got a custom control and one of the properties is:..public list&lt;selectionbox&gt; boxes { get; set; }...in the control constructor i have:..this.boxes = new list&lt;selectionbox&gt;();.this.boxes.add(new selectionbox("""", color.red));...before initializecomponent(), if i do a breakpoint here it shows that boxes is a list of selectionbox with 1 element.  but then inside of my onpaint override it has been set to null with some weird behaviour, if i do the following:..foreach (selectionbox box in boxes) {}...it doesn't throw an error it just exits the function by there.  what am i doing wrong?..selection box struct:..[serializable].public struct selectionbox.{.    public string name;.    public color colour;.    public rectangle boxrectangle;.    public bool isactive;..    public selectionbox(string name, color colour).    {.        this.name = name;.        this.colour = colour;.        this.isactive = false;.        this.boxrectangle = new rectangle(0, 0, 0, 0);.    }.}"
