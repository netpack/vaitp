"checking if string contains multiple letters i have a collection of an object called dictionarywords...for each word in this collection i need to check if it does not contain certain letters. if it does contain one or more of a certain letter it is removed from the collection...example:..collection before removal: ['abc','dee',fff'].letters to check for: e,f.collection after removal: ['abc']...rather than specifying multiple letters is there a way to check against an array?..my code:..foreach(dictionaryword word in dictionarywords).{.    if (!word.contains(""d"") &amp;&amp; !word.contains(""e"") // optimize this line.    {.        // word does not contain letters, word is good.    }.}...how can i replace the ""optimize this line"" to say ""if word contains any letter from an array of values""..thanks,.andrew"
