"saving a drawing in blank i am trying to make a paint application in windows forms (blank). it has different tabs and there is a picturebox in one tab which acts as my drawing surface. i am saving the image by copying from screen using the following code :         ..bitmap bmpz = new bitmap(picturebox1.width, picturebox1.height);.graphics gsaveas = graphics.fromimage(bmpz);.rectangle rectsaveas = picturebox1.rectangletoscreen(picturebox1.clientrectangle);.gsaveas.copyfromscreen(rectsaveas.location, point.empty, picturebox1.size);...is there a better way to save the drawing? the above method produces an image but need not be same as the one drawn. for eg, if i have a pop up or something on top of the picturebox, then the saved image will also have a pop up in it. how can i save just what is drawn on the screen?"
