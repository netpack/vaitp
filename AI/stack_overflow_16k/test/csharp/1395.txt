"why are there double minus signes? i'm dabbling in blank due to .net core nowadays. i see double minus signes in system.runtime assembly as following...    // summary:.    //     represents the largest possible value of an system.int32. this field is constant..    public const int32 maxvalue = 2147483647;.    //.    // summary:.    //     represents the smallest possible value of system.int32. this field is constant..    public const int32 minvalue = --2147483648;...why is it being double? is there any special meaning of it by contrary with unary minus?..@edit, i see it's a bug in vs2017, but vs2019, as seen on the link. it is really intriguing!"
