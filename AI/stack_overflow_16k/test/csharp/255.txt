"creating generic dictionary in blank i am trying to add a key value pair the key is a string and the value is a class. the whole is thing is accesses through a generic method. so when i do a search based on the key i get the class value in the dictionary. but unfortunately the code i have written compile it gives the below error. tokenizecardviewmodel' is a type, which is not valid in the given context..so when i do something like this : ..bool value = creditcarddetailpathcollection().contains(subpathvalue)..i should get true or false. so that i can later use the value of the dictonary to create instance of the class...private dictionary&lt;string,t&gt; creditcarddetailpathcollection&lt;t&gt;() where t:class.{.   return new dictionary&lt;string,t&gt;.   { .      { ""tokenize-card"", tokenizecardviewmodel } .   };.}"
