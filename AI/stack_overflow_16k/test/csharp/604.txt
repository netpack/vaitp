"downloadfile the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process i have my downloader downloading files and it runs fine for the most part, but ever so often it start throwing exceptions. the exception is:..[11:15:34 a.m.] &gt;&gt; [error startdownloadfile] an exception occurred during a webclient request. | system.io.ioexception: the process cannot access the file 'a:usersuserdownloadstestfile.extention' because it is being used by another process..   at system.io.__error.winioerror(int32 errorcode, string maybefullpath).   at system.io.filestream.init(string path, filemode mode, fileaccess access, int32 rights, boolean userights, fileshare share, int32 buffersize, fileoptions options, security_attributes secattrs, string msgpath, boolean bfromproxy, boolean uselongpath, boolean checkhost).   at system.io.filestream..ctor(string path, filemode mode, fileaccess access, fileshare share, int32 buffersize, fileoptions options, string msgpath, boolean bfromproxy).   at system.io.filestream..ctor(string path, filemode mode, fileaccess access).   at system.net.webclient.downloadfile(uri address, string filename)...the code i am using for this is:..while (true).            {.    try.        {.            downloadurl = new uri(result.url);.            var filename = dir + ""\"" + escapefilename(result.passedfilename) + "".extention"";..            while (true).            {.                using (var client = new webclient()).                {.                    client.downloadfile(downloadurl, filename);.                }..                long filesize = new fileinfo(filename).length;.                if (filesize &lt; 1000).                {.                    log(""[error] "" + result.passedfilename + "" failed, re-downloading"");.                }.                else.                {.                    break;.                }.            }.            break;.        }.        catch (exception ex).        {.            log(""[error startdownloadfile] "" + ex.message + "" | "" + ex.innerexception);.        }.    }...now looking at other asking similar questions their fix was to use garbage collection or something along those lines, but since i'm using webclient downloadfile i assume that is build in. so i'm not sure what is throwing this exception and how to fix it"
