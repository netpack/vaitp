"string replacement not replacing all instances using blank in visual studio 13 - i'm trying to replace some slashes in my string using the replace command.  the vs tool tip tells me, ""returns a new string in which all occurrences of a specified unicode character in this instance are replaced with another specified unicode character""..my string, which is passed in as a parameter is:..path = ""\\servername\folder1\folder2""...i create a new string:..string newpath = path.replace(@""\"", @""//"");...according to the tool tip it should replace all instances of \ with //, but instead my resulting string is:..""//\servername\folder1\folder2""...what am i doing wrong?  it seemed pretty straight forward to me, or so i thought...what i'm trying to get is:..""////servername//folder1//folder2"""
