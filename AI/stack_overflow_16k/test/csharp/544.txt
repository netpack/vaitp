"abstract/virtual classes: displaying color property in string format inside a multiline textbox i am currently learning to work with abstract classes and virtual. i created a simple form that generates the names of animals, color, and the sound they make. everything seems to work right except for color display property. the results are being displayed in a multiline textbox. is there a way to display the result with only the color name instead of this format color [darkgray]?..result when button clicked: ..betty is a color [darkgray] horse with four legs and runs very fast that goes neigh! neigh!!...the desired result:..betty is a dark gray horse with four legs and runs very fast that goes neigh! neigh!!...code..namespace farm.{.    public partial class form1 : form.    {.        public form1().        {.            initializecomponent();.        }..        public abstract class animal.        {.            protected string the_name;.            protected string the_type;.            protected color the_color;.            protected string features;..            public virtual string speaks().            {.                return """";.            }..            public override string tostring().            {.                string s = the_name + "" is a "" + the_color + "" "" + the_type + "" with "" + features + "" that goes "" + speaks();.                return s;.            }.        }..public class horse : animal.        {.            public horse(string new_name, color new_color).            {.                the_name = new_name;.                the_color = new_color;.                the_type = ""horse"";.                features = ""four legs and runs very fast"";..            }..            public override string speaks().            {.                return ""neigh! neigh!!"";.            }..        }.. private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).        {..            horse horse1 = new horse(""topaz"", color.darkgray);.            textbox1.appendtext(horse1.tostring());.        }.    }.}"
