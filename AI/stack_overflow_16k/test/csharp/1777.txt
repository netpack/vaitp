"what's a simple way to flatten a dynamic object? i have a tojson method which performs the following:..public object tojson().{.    return new.        {.            attr = new.                {.                    id = id,.                    entityid = entityid,.                    rel = type.getdescription().tolowerinvariant(),.                    additionalattributes = additionalattributes.                },.            data = new.                {.                    title = title,.                    icon = iconpath.                }.        };.}...it's no good for me to have additionalattributes be at a lower level than the rest of the properties. i would like to flatten its properties into the same level as id, entityid and rel...for example, if additionalattributes is:..subcomponentnode.additionalattributes = new.    {.        count = subcomponent.count.    };...then i would hope for attr to consist of id, entityid, rel and count...i'm not expecting any conflicting attribute names. if there are conflicts, merging or ignoring is ok -- whichever is easier to support...is this a trivial operation in blank? i can achieve it like this, but it feels a bit dirty:..dynamic attr = additionalattributes;.attr.id = id;.attr.entityid = entityid;.attr.rel = type.getdescription().tolowerinvariant();"
