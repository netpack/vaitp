prevent method from executing from different threads at the same time am i correct that the only way to prevent a method from being executed twice at the same time is by using a lock statement?..private object lockmethod = new object();..public void method() {.    lock (lockmethod) {.        // work.    }.}..public void fromthread1() {.    method();.}..public void fromthread2() {.    method();.}...of course i can also use methodimpl(methodimploptions.synchronized) what would be almost the same...are there other techniques?
