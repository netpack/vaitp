blank - fastest way to copy image files in lan computer i request to read my problem till end. someone might find it duplicate...i have a windows application (client app) a machine &amp; web application (server app) on another machine in same network..client app is capturing screen 5fps and keeping in a local folder which is shared. i have a windows service which runs on server machine. it moves client images to server directory from client shared folder. i am using file.move to move the files along with fastdirectoryenumerator class. these moved files are used to create videos later and also used to show live streaming...questions:..is there any other (best/fastest) option to move these files in real time (transfer as soon as it is created at client side)?.i am also interested in file transfer in real time without shared folder...update:..my major concerns....file transfer should be faster to allow live streaming through my server app (asp.net).client should retain it if server/connection is not available &amp; transfer as soon as it comes online.
