how to split decimal to long mantissa and sbyte exponent? or how to read blank decimal in c++? this question is opposite to my another this question. i need to do opposite operation. i have blank decimal which i need to convert to this structure:..    public struct significand.    {.        public uint mantissa;  // or ulong.        public sbyte exponent;.    }...i pass this structure to c++ library via p/invoke later. how can i convert decimal to this structure? i guess probably i should use decimal.getbits method somehow? or probably i can declare c++ structure some way so decimal will be automatically converted to it (i think they should be binary-compatible). currently i'm using such c++ struct:..struct significand_t.{.uint32_t mantissa;.int8_t exponent;.};
