"how to bring a application on to via httplistener? i have the problem bringing another application ( prepar3d v4.4 = fs ) to front and send some keystrokes to this..the problem is to bring the fs to front via a httplistener..i try to explain:.fs is running ( possible in the background ).my application runs always in background ( not as icon ) and listening for http calls via a httplistener..another applitaion sends a http request to my application and then ( the problem ) my application must bring the fs window to front and make it the active window. then my application must send some keystrokes to fs...now, in my application i have a funktion to bring the fs window on top and send some keystrokes. when i call this funktion via a button click from my application all works fine. fs will get the focus and become active and the keystroke is send. fs recives the keystroke...but when my application recives the request via the httplistenre and call exactly the same funktion it will not work...can anyone help here ?..thanks.matthias"
