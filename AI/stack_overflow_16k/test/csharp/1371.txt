"best way to assign property value dynamically based on the property name i have a list that i am iterating through...inside the list&lt;> are argument classes which contain two properties 'propertyname' and 'value'..what i need to do is iterate through the collection of arguments and assign the value of that argument to the property (with the same name as current argument) of a different class...example:..argument:.     propertyname: clientid.            value: 1234.members class:.     clientid = {argument value here}...i hope this makes sense. i have a way of doing it, hard coding the properties of my class and matching it up with the argument list. ..something like:..foreach(var arg in list&lt;argument&gt;).{.    members.clientid = arg.find(x =&gt; comparename(x, ""clientid"")).value;.    //where comparename just does a simple string.compare.}...but what would the best way be for something like this?..edit: sorry about this guys and thanks for the replies so far. here is what i didn't mention and might make a difference...each argument is a different property for the same class. i am iterating through the list and each one in there will be for the same members class i have to populate...i wanted to mention this because im thinking in the foreach i might have to use a switch to determine what 'propertyname' i have for that argument. clientid is one of them but i believe there are 14 total properties in the members class that need populated from the collection...does that change things?..thanks again"
