"blank rounding issue i have a double called int_step which i'm increasing every loop and expect to end when i have reached 1. however it iterates too much as rounding throws in some unexpected behaviour...for some reason the following code adds quite nicely, but close to 1 i get an offset:..            int_step += 0.01;..            // todo : fix rounding step in double with step increase of + 0.01, provides error because value will become 1.000000007.            if (int_step &gt;= 1).                int_step = 1;...can anyone explain why this happens and what the correct way is to solve this?"
