"my music player showing multiple instances of the same form, for each track i am trying to create a simple media player that just runs from the notifyicon tray using a context menu strip, sitting on an hidden form. ..when i click on the menu item 'play mp3's' it opens up a folder, allowing me to select a bunch of mp3 tracks. these tracks are stored in a listbox on the hidden form allowing me to manipulate them through the blank code. the code i have will always play the first song, no problem, but the ones after that has been a pain. ..the way i found to make the songs continue to play was by using showdialog for each song, but as you guessed that means there are multiple instances of the same form. soon as i stop using the show.dialog, i am back to one song again. is it because i am using the wmplib without the actual player on the form, i am sure that is not the case. i have managed to pick up tons of knowledge on here to get me this far, like using playstatechange, being able to select the next item in the list box and how to play a song list. unfortunately most of the time this is with using the media player console and buttons...here is the specific code that is causing the issue, as it stands it plays every track, soon as i comment out showdialog, it only plays the first song...private void trackplayer().{.    listbox1.selectedindex = listbox1.selectedindex + 1;.    var selectedurl = listbox1.selecteditem.tostring();.    player.url = selectedurl;.    player.controls.play();.    mytempformopen();.}..public void mytempformopen().{.    var myform1 = new form1();.    myform1.showdialog();.}...could you please help a frustrated newbie, any questions i am happy to respond to...here is my formload section..#region check internet when form opens.private void form1_load(object sender, eventargs e).{.    notifyicon1.text = (playingtoolstripmenuitem.text);.    checktheinternet();.}.#endregion..here is the internet checker code called from the loadform..#region check for internet connection loop.private void checktheinternet().{.while (true).{.bool con = networkinterface.getisnetworkavailable();.if (con == false).{.messagebox.show(""no internet connection!"");.playingtoolstripmenuitem.text = ""no internet connection!"";.notifyicon1.icon = radio_off;.notifyicon1.visible = true;.return;.}.else.{.return;.}.}.}.#endregion...this is where the file selection starts..region play mp3 list automatically..private void mp3toolstripmenuitem_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.player.playstatechange += new wmplib._wmpocxevents_playstatechangeeventhandler(player_playstatechange);.string[] files, paths;..openfiledialog ofd = new openfiledialog();.ofd.multiselect = true;.ofd.filter = ""music files |*.mp3;*.wav"";..if (ofd.showdialog() == system.windows.forms.dialogresult.ok).{.pausetoolstripmenuitem.visible = true;.files = ofd.safefilenames;..for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++).{.listbox1.items.add(paths[i]);.mycount = i + 1;.}.trackplayer();.}.}"
