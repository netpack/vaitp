"usecases for method hiding using new this is more or less an exact duplicate of this post, but as i cannot edit it, i started this. feel free to move something over and close this one...using method hiding with new seems like a dangerous feature, and given the discussion in the other thread, it seems it's not only i who have problems finding a valid use case for this. any methods accepting base won't use derived's method...public class base.{.    public void method().    {.        console.writeline(""base"");.    }.}..public class derived : base.{.    public new void method().    {.        console.writeline(""derived"");.    }.}..var derived = new derived();.derived.method(); // ""derived"".((base)derived).method(); // ""base""...so what are some valid use cases for new that is difficult to solve with other features?"
