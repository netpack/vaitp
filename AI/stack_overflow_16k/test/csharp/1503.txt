"mm-dd-yyyy to julian yyddd i am trying to get a label to display the julian date in a specific format. the last two digits of the year then the day in the year, so for example january 1 2021 would be 210001. i am having difficulty getting it to display both of these values attached and making the day slot have 3 values instead of 2..this is what i have..this just gives the day of the year but still not as a 3 digit day so it shows 1 as 1 instead of 001 which is my goal..any help would be appreciated! :)"
