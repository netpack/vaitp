"listviewitem in wpf listview i'm attempting to get the listviewitem object from the currently selected row of a data bound listview, like so:..listviewitem selecteditem = new listviewitem();.selecteditem = (listviewitem)listview1.items[index];...what this does however, is returns the object type the listview is bound to, in this instance, its a company class object for a database. what i would like it to return is the actual listviewitem object itself (so that i can access its properties)...is there anyway to do this?..thanks"
