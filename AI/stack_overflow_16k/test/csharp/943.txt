"eventlog counting users good day, i've been fiddling around with the eventlog method, and with fiddling around i was able to count how many entry.replacementstrings[5] aka usernames would be there. ..public int countusers { get; set; }.public string user { get; set; }.public users(int count, string name).{.    countusers = count;.    user = name;.}..public void getcountusers().{.    number = 0; //.    userlist = new observablecollection&lt;users&gt;();.    eventlog mynewlog = new eventlog(); .    mynewlog.log = ""security"";.    foreach (eventlogentry entry in mynewlog.entries).    {.        if (entry.instanceid == 4624 &amp;&amp; entry.timewritten.date == datetime.today).        {.            if (userlist.count &gt; 0).            {.                bool check = false;.                foreach (var user in userlist).                {.                    if (user.user == entry.replacementstrings[5]).                    {.                        user.countusers += 1;.                        check = true;.                    }.                }.                if (!check).                {.                    users u = new users(1, entry.replacementstrings[5]);.                    userlist.add(u);.                }.            }.            else.            {.                users u = new users(1, entry.replacementstrings[5]);.                userlist = new observablecollection&lt;users&gt;();.                userlist.add(u);.            }.        }.    }.}..public void counter().{..    var totalusers = userlist.sum(user =&gt; user.countusers); .    foreach (var user in userlist).    {..        console.writeline(""there has been {0} users on {1}"", user.countusers, datetime.today.toshortdatestring());.    }.}...is what i currently have. what i now want to be able to do is, add a regex to the writeline so it doesn't count the user system...i was able to do it with but that would print out every individual user, but instead i want the general/global idea of how many people were online at said date. ..so i need to know how to do it with getting rid of the for each loop, and just getting the user.countusers...foreach (var user in userlist).{.    regex user = new regex(@""system"");.    match match = user.match(user.user);.    if (!match.success).    {}.}...i now don't know how to call the variable so my regex works. anyone know how to fix it, maybe possibly without a regex?..(side note: i also need help with the fact that the eventlog is 2x, when it should be 1 by the ones that are legit. i would need to see how i would filter that)"
