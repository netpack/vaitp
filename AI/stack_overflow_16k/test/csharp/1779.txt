"blank force inherited class looping through list so for example i have two classes:..class a.{.  string property1;.  string property2;.}..class b : a.{.  string property3;.  string property4;.  .....} ...so b inherits class a's properties. they are sitting in a list, that is sitting in a dictionary ..dictionary &lt;string, list&lt;a&gt;&gt; mydictionary = new dictionary&lt;string, list&lt;a&gt;&gt;();..list&lt;a&gt; mylist = new list&lt;a&gt;();...there is one dictionary, containing many list's, that all contain a mix of class a &amp; b objects. .while looping through, i am trying to access some properties from class b objects, i have an if statement to find them but the program still thinks they are of type class a and throws an error when i try and use a property3 or property4. for example: ..string key = string key in dictionary;.string index = object position in list;..mydictionary[key][index].property3.somemethod();...is there a way to tell the program that this is a class b object and allow the properties 3 &amp; 4 to be used?"
