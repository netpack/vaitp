"copy and paste in different formats i have a datagrid that i want to be able to copy and paste to/from excel. pretty common scenario. i have the copy and paste functions implemented. however, this application has several datagrids, and i'd like to prevent the user from trying to copy data from one grid to another since the data is different...i can serialize the objects in these grids to any format i want, so adding some kind of metadata that says ""this data only goes in that grid"" is trivial. but i can't add the metadata because then it would show up in excel. is there some solution to this problem that allows me to paste data in one format in my application, but that excel will still handle correctly?"
