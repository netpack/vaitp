"how to have a window pop up when progress bar finishes in blank i have seen a similar answer but it's not in blank so i decided to ask this question..https://gyazo.com/3ff6efd90fa390cd1f071b693027fcd3 after it reaches that point i want a window to pop up which says ""successfully loaded..."". the timer interval i have set is 50 if that helps..this is the code:..private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        this.timer1.start();.    }..private void progressbar1_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {..    }..private void timer1_tick(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        this.progressbar1.increment(1);.    }"
