"error handling in package using a filter but missing reference i am trying to make a package that can handle errors from methods by simply adding a [attribute] above the method...in my package i have ..public class requestlogfilter : exceptionfilterattribute.{.  public override void onexception(httpactionexecutedcontext filtercontext).  {.     log(filtercontext.exception);..     base.onexception(filtercontext);.  }..  private void log(exception exception).  {.     //log exception here....  }.}...when i try to use it in my mvc project..[requestlogfilter].  public async task&lt;actionresult&gt; index()...it says that cannot access internal class here.  my question is, is there some other decorator i should use besides exceptionfilterattribute?  it says i need to reference system.web.http, but i don't have that in the references selection in my mvc project...the goal is that if they call this type of filter it will log any exception to said filter."
