"reading and write specific lines to text file blank i have a master file called filename with ids of people. it is in sorted order..i want to divide ids into 27 chunks and copy each chunk into a different text file...using (filestream fs = file.open(filename, filemode.open, fileaccess.read, fileshare.readwrite)).         {.            string line;.      int numoflines = file.readalllines(filename).length;  -- i have 73467.       int eachsubset = (numoflines / 27);.       var lines = file.readalllines(datafilename).take(eachsubset);.       file.writealllines(filename1,lines);.      }...i have 27 different text files. so i want 73467 of ids divided equally and copied over to 27 different files. so, 1st file will have id#1 to id#2721.2nd dile will have id#2722 to id#(2722+2721) and so on. i do not know how to automate this and run this quickly...thanks.hr"
