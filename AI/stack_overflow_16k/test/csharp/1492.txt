"kmers - how to join sequences and put substrings into array i am currently trying to find a way to implement a small bioinformatics library for operations with dna sequences. these are represented as strings of only characters a, c, g and t. how do i make this method take the following parameters?...an integer specifying k.an arbitrary number of dna sequences each provided as individual arguments...i need to make it so it joins these sequences and puts each one into its own array...i have created two methods so far: main() and kmers(). i have made it so the kmer method will break down a string such as ""agatcgagtg"" into 3-mers such as:..agagatatctcgcgagagagtgtg..my main() method then prints these values:..using system;..class sequence.{..    public static void main(string[] args).    {.        foreach (string kmerarray in kmers(3, ""gcatacgat"")).        {.            console.write(kmerarray);.        }.        console.readline();.    }..    public static array kmers(int k, params string[] x).    {.        int arraysize = x.length;.        string[] kmer = new string[arraysize];..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; arraysize - k + 1; i++).        {.            if (i &lt;= arraysize).            {.                kmer[i] = x.substring(i, k);.            }.        }..        return kmer;.    }.}...my output should look like this:..aga,gat,atc,tcg,cga,gag,agt,gtg"
