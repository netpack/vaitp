"custom event aggregator in winforms mvp app i have decided to build my own event aggregator for a winforms mvp application i am writing..the purpose is to allow views (user controls) to subscribe to events from models that otherwise have their views...the question is; since there should be one common event aggregator, and the aggregator is only needed when composing the application of user controls that should interact, then what is the best way of exposing the event aggregator?..my suggestions so far:  ...i think injecting it would be a mess, since all user controls would have to have an ieventaggregator and the aggregator is not necessary for the user control itself, just the master app which is composed of user controls with added functionality..making the eventaggregator static or singleton. this, however, would pose a similar problem, where the individual user controls would have to publish event through the static aggregator....do you have some ideas to help me along?"
