"generic object to call correct method overview: i'm writing a test program that i'm trying to break into 3 layers.  the top layer is the test that i'm running, it contains the state machine to be run (the order is the same for all devices).  the second layer is the device layer, it has all the commands specific to that device.  all devices have the same commands, but the syntax can be different.  ..problem: how can i generically set the device type and call the correct command?  i have classdevice1 and classdevice2.  they both have a .cmd1() method.  in the top layer (test layer) i want to take a object and set it = to say classdevice1.  so in the test code i can just generically call object.cmd1() and it will call it from classdevice1.....edit: i want my top layer to just be generic. it will called object.cmd1() for example. object can be one of n classes i have, in which they all have a cmd1() method. how do i declare a generic object that points to a class?"
