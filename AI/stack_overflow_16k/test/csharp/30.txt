"delete folder/files and subfolder i want to delete a folder containing files and a subfolder, also containing files. i have used everything, but it is not working for me. i'm using the following function in my web-application asp.net:..var dir = new directoryinfo(folder_path);.dir.delete(true); ...sometimes it deletes a folder, or sometimes it doesn't. if a subfolder contains a file, it only deletes the file, and not the folder as well."
