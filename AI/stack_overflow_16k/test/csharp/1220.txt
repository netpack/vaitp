"generic method, how to get values if it is a list? i have a generic method and it's possible that the object passed is a single object or a list of objects.  example:..public void mygenericmethod&lt;t&gt;(t something, int? index).{.    // if it is a list how do i get to the object in the list?.}...there are cases when someone will pass a list.  if they do pass a list of objects i will then use the index parameter to get the single object out of the list.  i can assume that if index is not null then they passed in a list, but then how do i get to that value?  i can't do this:..object temp = something[index.value];...it's important to note that i cannot force the user to pass in a single object into my generic method.  also i cannot make it an array (t[]) and force the user to pass in an array (or a list)."
