"dynamically create object and add to list i would like to use a method to create an instance of adventurer and then add it to a list&lt;adventurer&gt;. a for loop will create 20 instances of adventurer. i am trying to avoid using a constructor since down the road i will have quite a few values to pass in. if what i am trying to do is not possible, i will have to revert to using the constructor...i need this method to create a new instance of adventurer and assign values randomgender,randomclass, and name to it. at this point i don't know how. also, i can't create a new instance and manually name it since this method will be called many times...    public static adventurer createadventurer().    {.        array valuesgender = enum.getvalues(typeof(adventurergender));.        adventurergender randomgender = (adventurergender)valuesgender.getvalue(rand.next(valuesgender.length));..        array valuesclass = enum.getvalues(typeof(adventurerclass));.        adventurerclass randomclass = (adventurerclass)valuesclass.getvalue(rand.next(valuesclass.length));..        string name = ""test "" + adventurermanager.avaliableadvlist.count.tostring();..        return new adventurer();.    }...here is my for loop:..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++).        {.            adventurermanager.avaliableadvlist.add(adventurermanager.createadventurer());.        }...so my question is... in createadventurer is it possible to assign values to a new instance of adventurer without manually declaring it and without use of a constructor? or would it be easier to just have a very long constructor somewhere down the road?"
