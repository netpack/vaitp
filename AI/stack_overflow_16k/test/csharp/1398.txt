"remove the null line in a text file i like to export a text file to be read by some plc which could not process empty or null lines. the rn in writeline generate a null line at the end of the text file, and i could not figure a way to not generate it or to remove it...this is how i generate and write the lines:..list&lt;string&gt; lines = new list&lt;string&gt;();.lines.add(...);.foreach (string line in lines).{.    file.writeline(line);.}...i tried removing the line with the following code but the end null line remains:..list&lt;string&gt; lines = file.readalllines(path).where(arg =&gt; !string.isnullorwhitespace(arg)).tolist();.file.writealllines(path, lines);...i also tried deleting the last line, but of course it remove the last line instead of the carriage return....lines = lines.getrange(0, lines.count - 1);...the image demonstrate pictorially the issue (left) and what i like to achieve (right)"
