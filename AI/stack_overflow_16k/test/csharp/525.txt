"blank : how to assign and retrieve values into member variables of base class i'm a beginner. i'm trying to write a program which has a color class that does various things ( red, green, blue and alpha value) to get the grayscale value for color. but i don't know how to assign a value into a member variable of a base class..firstly, i create a constructor that takes red, blue, green and alpha value like this   ..private byte red;.private byte green;.private byte blue;.private byte alpha;.public color(byte red, byte green, byte blue, byte alpha).{.    this.red = red;.    this.green = green;.    this.blue = blue;.    this.alpha = alpha;. }...then i declare a color variable (i want people to be able to input the value)..color color = new color(.  convert.tobyte(.    console.readline().  ), convert.tobyte(.    console.readline().  ), convert.tobyte(.    console.readline().  ), 255.);...is it right? will the red variable be assigned to the value that user inputs?  ..if it's right, how can i ask the user before they input ?.for example, before they input the red value, i will ask them:...  input your red value...then i will ask them ...  input your green value...and they continue to input their values,... etc.....another problem: i also want to create methods in the color class to get(retrieve) the red, green, blue values from color objects. i created them, but i don't know if it's right. can you check it for me, please?..public byte getred(byte red).{.    return red;.}..public byte getgreen(byte green).{.    return green;.}..public byte getblue (byte blue).{.    return blue;.}..public byte getalpha(byte alpha).{.    alpha = 255;.    return alpha;.}"
