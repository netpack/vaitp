"how to activate different sections of code in a console application in blank i am new to programming and have decided that creating a simple console application ""adventure book"" (like a text based rpg) would be a good way to start immersing myself into the world of blank programming. i am having an issue with being unable to return to sections of code and to skip others. for example i am able to go from the start to option 1, but am unable to go straight to option 2 without it showing only option 1. nor am i able to return from option 1 to the start...i assume this is because the section of code for option 2 is below that of option 1. i could see some kind of activate/deactivate system possibly working by deactivating option 1 + the start and activating option 2 etc. i'm not even sure if that is possible, nor do i have any idea on how to do so...any help is greatly appreciated :d..string nextpage;.        int page = 0;..        //start.        do.        {.            console.writeline("""");.            console.writeline(""type option 1 to go to option 1"");.            console.writeline("""");.            console.writeline(""type option 2 to go to option 1"");.            console.writeline("""");.            nextpage = console.readline().toupper();.            if (nextpage == ""option 1"").            {.                page = 1;.            }.            if (nextpage == ""option 2"").            {.                page = 2;.            }.            else.            {.            }.        } while (page == 0);..        //option 1.        do.        {.            console.clear();.            console.writeline(""welcome to option 1"");.            console.writeline(""type start to go to start"");.            console.writeline("""");.            nextpage = console.readline().toupper();.            if (nextpage == ""start"").            {.                page = 0;.            }.            else.            {.            }.        } while (page == 1);..        //option 2.        do.        {.            console.clear();.            console.writeline(""welcome to option 2"");.            console.writeline(""type start to go to start"");.            console.writeline("""");.            nextpage = console.readline().toupper();.            if (nextpage == ""start"").            {.                page = 0;.            }.            else.            {.            }.        } while (page == 2);"
