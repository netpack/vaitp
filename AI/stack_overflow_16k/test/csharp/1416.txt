"how to read a number in specific line and increase by one i'm trying to write a program that can increase the amount of lines in a .ini file..the files looks like this (not the complete file):..[indexfile]..;*** database files ***.filespec_1=c:solid4.2solid.1 1000m.filespec_2=c:solid4.2solid.2 1000m.filespec_3=c:solid4.2solid.3 1000m.;.; solid uses by default 'solid.db' as the first database file,...i want my program to read amount of lines containing ""filespec"" in the file and ask the user how many lines he/she wan't in total. user input amount ex: 8. then the program writes five additional lines to the file...this is what i have so far:..int count = file.readlines(filepath).skip(16).count(line =&gt; line.contains(""filespec""));.console.writeline((""there are "") + (count) + ("" filespec-lines in the file, how many do you want in total?""));.int antall22=(int)convert.toint32(console.readline());..int linestoadd = antall22 - count;...so, ""linestoadd"" is the amount of lines that should be written to the file..how can i write amount of lines to the file and also increase the numbers after the underscore so that it increases to two(10+) and three(100+) digits numbers?"
