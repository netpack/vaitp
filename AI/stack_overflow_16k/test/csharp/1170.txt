"determine which object's tile is taken over i'm in the making of a small recreation of the game ""virus"". i am making the game for two players but plan to make an option for more players...if you do a move, you copy your tile to a tile next to you and taking over all surrounding enemy tiles. i currently have it as the following (commented, since everything is in dutch):..//go through the list of direct neighbors of the destination tile.//if that neighbor's team is not neutral and not of their own team, take that tile over.//taking over that tile is currently as follows:..for(int i = 0; i &lt; destinationtile.directneighbors.count(); i++).{.    destinationtile.directneighbors[i].backcolor = players[currentplayer].teamcolor;.    players[currentplayer].tilesowned.add(directneighbors[i]);..    players[currentenemy].tilesowned.remove(directneighbors[i]);.} //tilesowned being a list on every player...this works for what i currently have: a game with only 2 players. but if i want to play with more than 2 players, this doesn't work. i have to retrieve what enemy the tile has been taken over from...how do i determine what player's tile has been taken over?"
