"is it possible to create an extension method that is called when the object is created? i cannot modify the object i am working with and i need a method but i really want it to be called when the object is created. so i was thinking that a extension method would be good here, however i don't know if it is possible but, if it is, then how?..edited:..my static class has this main object which i am supposed to create:..ecuversion ecu;...i will call this method from my class:..ecu = convertautodetect.convert(rawdata, ecu, response);...and the platform will be looking for the ecu object...my method will return an ecuversion object. this object contains a collection besides a lot of other things and i am working only with the respective collection which is:..icollection&lt;autodetectstep&gt; autodetectsteps { get; set; }...autodetectstep class has 4 childs and on one of it's childs i needed this extension method to be called when the child is created...i have to create many childs and add them to the collection, also, i will never be instantiated my object because everything is static in there...so is it suitable to use the factory pattern ?"
