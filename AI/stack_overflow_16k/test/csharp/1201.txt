"how would i use 'console.readline' multiple times? i'm trying to write a program that asks the user to think of a number between 1-100, and it will then ask ""is the number higher or lower than 50?"" if the user inputs ""higher"" the program will execute a random number between 50-100. i have got everything working correctly except the fact ""userinput"" will only work for one line, example: if i was to input ""higher"" it will work no problem, the program then asks if the new number generated is correct and asks the user to input either ""yes/no"" and at that stage the program won't execute the input...but, if you enter ""yes/no"" before ""higher/lower"" it wil work, so my guess is, because i've declared ""userinput"" to 'console.readline' it won't read what the users real input is on the second line they write, my question is...what else could i do instead of declaring it to that string? as you can tell i'm new to programming! any feedback is much appricated!..code: http://pastebin.com/cew3tccq"
