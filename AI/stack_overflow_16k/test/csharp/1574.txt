"equality comparer `findindex` vs `indexof` i have this line of code:..int myindex = mylistofcustomobjects.indexof(candidateobject); .// assume candidateobject exists in the list...now i know that list.findindex method:...  searches for an element that matches the conditions defined by a.  specified predicate, and returns the zero-based index of the first.  occurrence within the list or a portion of it....i was wondering, do all objects of a certain class have the same size? ..if yes, and since that there is no specified predicate using the indexof,  then what conditions should be matched in order for candidateobject to be found within mylistofcustomobjects? ..also, what is meant by "".. or a portion of it.""?"
