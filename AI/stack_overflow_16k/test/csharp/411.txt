"reading printer data i've been presented with a task where i'm unfamiliar with concepts. ..task - read printer data stream from a pos system. ..terms mentioned.esc/p ..i have to read values coming from a pos system. my first question is how can you determine the start and end of a print job?..i guess i'm looking for control characters of a printer maybe?..also, is there a way to simulate this without interrupting the pos?..anyone know good examples or references they are familiar with themselves?"
