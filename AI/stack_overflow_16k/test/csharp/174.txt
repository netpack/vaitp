"infinite loop in an if-else statement determining list equality i have this snippet of code that checks for size equality of a list. if their size is equal, and if all elements of _cachedsecondlist is equal to secondlist, then it does nothing (though i have some debugging text in this particular example). ..otherwise, if the the count is equal, but the items are different in each list, then it would trigger menu_handleoutofbounds() which refreshes the canvas...if (_cachedsecondlist.count == secondlist.count).{.    if (_cachedsecondlist.sequenceequal(secondlist)).    {.        string s = string.join("","", _cachedsecondlist);.        string b = string.join("","", secondlist);.        messagebox.show(""second: "" + s);.        messagebox.show(""second: "" + b);.        return;.    }.    else.    {.        menu_handleoutofbounds(_sender, _e);.        messagebox.show(""triggered equality check. new index: "" + _index);.    }.}...for some very strange reason, both the if and else are triggered in my code, and i am stuck in an infinite loop every single time...i tried to put the return to exit the loops if the condition is met in the .sequenceequal() conditions, but no avail...first messagebox:....second messagebox: ....third messagebox:"
