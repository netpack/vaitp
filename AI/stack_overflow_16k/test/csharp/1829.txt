"replacing characters in windows form application i need to make a windows form application in blank that provides the user with a textbox, and upon clicking a button it changes the letters in the first textbox to a replacement in the other one. ..for example:.if i type ""apple"" in the first textbox and i have replaced ""a"" with ""b"" and ""p"" with ""o"" it should spell ""baoole"". ..this process also has to work in reverse. i don't know how to accomplish this...i tried using .replace with every pair of letters in the alphabet ex: ""a"",""b""; ""c"",""d"";, but it only replaced the first letters so if i typed ""c"" it would not change to ""d"". once i tried to then replace ""d"",""c""; it overlapped and my program wouldn't work. i then tried this:..if (richtextbox1.text.contains(""a"")).{.    richtextbox2.text=richtextbox1.text.replace(""a"", ""b"");.}.if (richtextbox1.text.contains(""b"")).{.    richtextbox2.text=richtextbox1.text.replace(""b"", ""a"");.}...but it only successfully replaced the first character. i am sorry if i missed anything obvious, i am learning blank and am eager to learn more. thank you for your time and knowledge."
