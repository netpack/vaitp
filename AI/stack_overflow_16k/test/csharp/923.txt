"how to prevent system.uri from decoding url's take this example:..var client = new httpclient();.await client.getasync(""http://www.google.com?q=%2d"");...this actually sends a request to 'http://www.google.com?q=-'. i don't want .net to alter my url...this behavior is from system.uri, which seems to unescape those character...how can i prevent uri/httpclient from changing my url?...net framework 4.7.2..update: this behavior seems by design. i still can't believe there is not a way around this. what if i actually want to send '?q=what does %2d mean' to google.com? now this gets send as 'http://www.google.com/?q=what%20does%20-%20mean'. which is not what i meant to do."
