"blank mouse_event out of sync i have a problem..when i send keystrokes to the application using sendkeys.sendwait i then change the position of the mouse and send keystrokes again. but when i change position and send keystrokes, it sends the keys on the last position, not on the current. i think this is probably because the application doesnt wait the mouse_event to be processed. could you please give me some examples on how to wait until the mouse_event is completed ?..this is the code:..sendkeys.sendwait(""aaa"");.cursor.position = new point(cursor.position.x - 70, cursor.position.y + 40);.uint x = (uint)cursor.position.x;.uint y = (uint)cursor.position.y;.mouse_event(mouseeventf_leftdown | mouseeventf_leftup, x, y, 0, 0);.sendkeys.sendwait(""aaa1"");"
