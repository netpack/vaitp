"how to run timer on separate thread i have need to make a splash screen with a progress bar. my problem is that i cannot link the main form with the splash screen:..public login_form() {.    thread t = new thread(new threadstart(splashstart));.    t.start();.    thread.sleep(5000);.    initializecomponent();.    t.abort();.}..public void splashstart() {.    application.run(new form1());.}...where i have ""application.run(new form1());"" it gives me an error under form1...this is the splash screen form:..public splashscreen_form() {.    initializecomponent();.    timer.start();.}..private void timer_tick(object sender, eventargs e) {.    this.opacity += 0.07;..    pbrload.increment(1);.    if (pbrload.value == 100) .        timer.stop();.}..private void splashscreen_form_load(object sender, eventargs e) {.    this.opacity = 0;.    timer.enabled = true;.}...now i need to keep it like that but with no errors."
