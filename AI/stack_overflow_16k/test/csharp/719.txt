"why can't i use the same generic type with inherited interface? hi,.i have the following scenario which i will try to explain as best as i can, appologies in advance if this is a silly question..i have two interfaces ( for the purposes of this example have nothing in them)..public interface interfacea {}.public interface interfaceb: interfacea {}...and 2 classes ..public classa&lt;interfacea&gt; {}.public classb: classa&lt;interfaceb&gt; { }...now also elsewhere i have a method which accepts the generic type as a param :..public static void dosomething( classa&lt;interfaceb&gt; p_val ) {}...ok then i consume these classes when creating my objects...classb obj1 = new classb();.classa&lt;interfacea&gt; obj2 = new classa&lt;interfacea&gt;();...ok all fine when i pass obj1 into dosomething() now but when i try to pass obj2 into my dosomething() method, i get a compilation error saying it cannot convert from interfacea to interfaceb. ..this kind of make sense since in my method, the generic param type is explicitly interfaceb. however if i want the method to accept both generic types ( obj1 and obj2), what should i do? hopefully this make sense."
