"adding a counter for the correct answer to determine the users score i'm trying to add a counter that will determine the users score if the user inputs the correct answer. though i can't seem to figure out how to add it into this if statement, or whether i need a new if statement. ..this is the code to check the answer...private void btncheckanswer_click(object sender, eventargs e).    {.        string answer = txtguess.text;..        if (answer.tolower().equals(country[index].tolower())).            messagebox.show(""correct!"");.        else.            messagebox.show(""incorrect!"");.    }...how would you add a counter that will be equivalent to the answer the user inputs. this counter will be displayed in a label called lblscorecount...thank you for time, ben"
