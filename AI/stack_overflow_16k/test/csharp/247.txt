"generic class containing a generic list of different type i am getting into generics and i have an issue of deciding which approach is better for having a generic class contain a generic list which is not of the same type as the containing class e.g...public class goal&lt;t&gt;.{.    public string name { get; set; }.    public int priority { get; set; }.    public list&lt;goal&lt;t&gt;&gt; dependencies { get; set; }.    public t value { get; set; }..    public goal(string name, int priority, t val).    {.        name = name;.        priority = priority;.        value = val;.        dependencies = new list&lt;goal&lt;t&gt;&gt;();.    }.}...what is the best way to have the 'dependencies' in the list be able to be of a different type then the containing class?..thanks"
