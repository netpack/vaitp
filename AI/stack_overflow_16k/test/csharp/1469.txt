"playing .wav file with blank i'm trying to play a .wav file thats located in a folder inside my project...the sound file is located on ""resource/sounds/slot_roll_on.wav""..the resource folder is a folder i created myself, in the root of the project...this is the code i'm using to run the .wav file..        assembly a = assembly.getexecutingassembly();.        stream s = a.getmanifestresourcestream(""kisscam.g.resources.resources.sounds.slot_roll_on.wav"");.        soundplayer snd = new soundplayer(s);.        snd.play();...i couldn't get the sound to play, i keep getting the windows sound for sound not found...somewhere on stack overflow i found this code to find what the right assembly path should be...            assembly a = assembly.getexecutingassembly();.            string[] resourcenames = assembly.getexecutingassembly().getmanifestresourcenames();.            int i;.            for (i = 0; i &lt; resourcenames.length; i++).            {..                messagebox.show(resourcenames[i]);...            }...it output these 2 paths..kisscam.properties.resources.resources...and..kissscam.g.resources...i tried using them both, but none of them works...anyone know what i'm doing wrong ?"
