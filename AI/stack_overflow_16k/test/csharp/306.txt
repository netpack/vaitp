blank: cannot locate system libraries i have just looked in my regedit and found i am running .net version 4.5.1 and therefore the libraries i am after should be available to me...i try to include the namespaces:..using system.io.memorystream;.using system.media.soundplayer;...however vs complains that the namespaces do not exist.  ..the reference pages for memorystream and soundplayer dictate that these should be available in my version of .net.  how can i fix this?
