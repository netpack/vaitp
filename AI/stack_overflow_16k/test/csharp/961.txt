"send data with serial port i want to program a rolling base. the connection of tx, rx, and gnd of the base is with rs232, but i haven't this port on my laptop. so i'm using an adaptor usb-rs232. the connection works because when i enter the different commands in putty, the robot moves. .so in visual studio, i create a serial port with this line :..serialport serialport1 = new serialport(""com7"", 115200, parity.none, 8, stopbits.one);...after, i connect it:..try.{.    serialport1.open();.}.catch (exception ex).{.    messagebox.show(""please connect to the base"");.}...so the serial port is opened. and finally, i send the buffer :..if (serialport1.isopen).{.    string str = ""!m 1 300"";.    serialport1.write(str);.    system.console.writeline(str);.}...but it doesn't work, the robot doesn't move. in putty i enter the same command:..!m 1 300...maybe i forget something?"
