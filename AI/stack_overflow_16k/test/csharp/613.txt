"is there a difference between initializing a variable in the default constructor or inline? i've found a few related questions in java, but none for blank, so please forgive any duplicates...short and sweet, whats the difference? is there any?..public static class foo.{.    public static list&lt;bar&gt; bars;..    static foo().    {.        bars = new list&lt;bar&gt;();.    }.}..public static class foo.{.    public static list&lt;bar&gt; bars = new list&lt;bar&gt;();.}...see the comment by @nick g for the answer to the case of non-static classes. i'd still like to know if it affects static classes any differently....now they don't have to be static either. what about this case?..public class foo.{.    public list&lt;bar&gt; bars;..    public foo().    {.        bars = new list&lt;bar&gt;();.    }.}..public class foo.{.    public list&lt;bar&gt; bars = new list&lt;bar&gt;();.}"
