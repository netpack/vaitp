"is there a way to perform an action every time an object changes state? i have an object that gets passed to an interface, i would like for the concrete sitting behind that interface to perform some action every time one of the object's members changes state. in other words, i have some object that contains an integer. when the value of that integer changes, i would like for my concrete class sitting behind that interface to do some work...now, i could probably do something like this by having a thread that's sitting in the wait state and performs the action once some pulse is done using a monitor. but, i was wondering if the blank language had the inherent support for such a thing. such that, when the object's member changes state the action will automatically be performed. i know that this may not be possible, and if there is an alternative solution i would like to hear that. or, does the thread thing sound like a good idea?"
