"blank pause program execution i am writing a program that will perform an operation every 10 or 15 minutes.  i want it to be running all the time, so i need something that is cheap on processing power.  what i have read so far seems to suggest that i want to use a timer.  here is a clip of the code i have so far...class program {.    private static timer timer = new timer();..    static void main(string[] args) {.        timer.elapsed += new elapsedeventhandler(dosomething);.        while(true) {.            timer.interval = timermilliseconds(); // the duration of the wait will differ each time.            timer.enabled=true;.        }.    }.}...the problem here is that the while loop just keeps executing rapidly.  how do i halt execution until the timer is elapsed.  my program really doesn't need to be multi threaded.  is a timer the right tool for this job?..thank you in advance for any help!..update: sorry for the confusion.  i have implemented the dosomething method.  i just did not include it as i don't believe it is part of my issue."
