"what is the difference between managed heap and native heap in blank application from this http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/04/02/diagnosing-memory-issues-with-the-new-memory-usage-tool-in-visual-studio.aspx...managed: for managed applications, the profiler only collects managed heap information by default. managed heap profiling is done by capturing a set of clr etw events in the profiler..native: for native applications, the profiler only collects native heap information. for collecting native heap information, we enable stack tracing and the collection of heap traces (etw) which are very verbose and will create large diagsession files....my question is in my blank program (i only have blank code with xaml files) what kinds of object will goes to managed heap and what kinds goes to native heap? and how can i specify the max size of each heap when my application runs?  i assume gc only runs on managed heap, is that correctly?"
