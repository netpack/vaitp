"can't do (expression yielding system.type)object cast? i've got an object[] array which contains some mixture of builtin types, like int/byte/string,  and i'm trying to cast at runtime from object to the correct type,  then handing that casted data to a 3rd party library that has write(builtin type overloads) method...i thought i could just do obj.write((expression yielding system.type)objarg),  but it errors on me...here's a code sample that explains it better:..    object testdata = (int)42;.    int final = (getatype())testdata;..    private type getatype().    {.        return typeof(int32);.    }...any suggestions?.alternate ways to accomplish this would be helpful also...for some context,  here's my original problem..3rd party library with a bunch of overloads for different types...3rdpartylibrary.write(bool source).3rdpartylibrary.write(int16 source).3rdpartylibrary.write(int32 source).3rdpartylibrary.write(string source)...i'm trying to abstract a layer between 3rdpartylibrary and the rest of my code..such that i can have.object[int32].object[int16].object[string].object[int32]...i'm trying to do something simple seeming, like this (psuedo-coded)..loop object[].{.  3rdpartylibrary.write( (object[i].gettype()) object[i] ).}...i've been reading all the similar sounding question, it looks like this may not be possible?"
