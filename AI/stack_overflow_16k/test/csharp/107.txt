"find best-matched line from a text file using keywords. sort of works, but not perfect, how do i fix? i have been trying to get this to work for the past two hours with quite a lot of success but it is not working 100%. it auto suggests lines from the file to the nearest 1-2 words i believe which is not what i want. i want it to suggest it as best as possible...an example is here: https://gyazo.com/6cb86e78b95026aeeb3f8cc96ca03163..as you can see, it gives me two suggestions in the console but prints the right one to me due to where it is placed in the text document. howcome it is not giving me the only one i want even though it's word-for-word and therefore has more keywords in common than the one without stattrak...this is my code:..string[] suggestcontents = file.readalllines(""csgo_items.txt"");.int linecount = 0;.int mostsimilar = 0;.int currentsimilar = 0;.string[] splitline = message.split(""_"".tochararray());.dictionary&lt;int, int&gt; suggestitem = new dictionary&lt;int, int&gt;();.foreach (string line in suggestcontents).{.    for(int i = 0; i &lt; splitline.length; i++).    {.        if(line.tolower().contains(splitline[i].tolower())).        {.            currentsimilar++;.        }.    }.    if(currentsimilar &gt; mostsimilar).    {.        list&lt;int&gt; suggestlist = new list&lt;int&gt;();.        foreach (keyvaluepair&lt;int, int&gt; entry in suggestitem).        {.            if(entry.value == mostsimilar).            {.                suggestlist.add(entry.key);.            }.        }.        foreach(int intremove in suggestlist).        {.            suggestitem.remove(intremove);.        }.        mostsimilar = currentsimilar;.        suggestitem.add(linecount, mostsimilar);.    }.    else if(currentsimilar == mostsimilar).    {.        suggestitem.add(linecount, mostsimilar);.    }.    linecount++;.    currentsimilar = 0;.}...thanks, any help is appreciated."
