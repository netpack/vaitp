"blank (possibly) using generics i'm pretty new to this, so please bear with me...i have a class which has three properties: a couple of ints and a collection of userdefined objects...public class response.{.    public int num1 { get; set; }.    public int num2 { get; set; }.    public drink[] drinks{ get; set; }.}...i can instantiate the class using the userdefined objects and everything works great...response response = new response.    {.        num1= 7, num2= 2, drinks= new drink[] .        { new drink{id=1, name=""orange""}, new drink{id=2, name=""apple""}}.    };...how can i make that third property of the response class to where i can have another instance of the class using a different userdefined object, say, ""snack""...looking for an online resource to read/learn/figure out more so than an answer, although either would be greatly appreciated."
