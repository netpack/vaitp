"blank switch between program, and a java program i need some help figuring out how to switch between programs, the first application i can simply get from the taskmgr process. but the second program launches an java applet and will be described as multiple java.exe's..maybe there lays a solution around getting process name by the windowtitle but since i am not that advanced in blank i am seeking for some help... private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{.    if (prog1).    {.        var prc = process.getprocessesbyname(""progam1"");.        if (prc.any()).        {.            setforegroundwindow(prc[0].mainwindowhandle);.            showwindow(prc[0].mainwindowhandle, showwindowemum.program);.            prog1 = false;.        }.    }.    else.    {.        var prc = process.getprocessesbyname(""a java applet"");.        if (prc.any()).        {.            setforegroundwindow(prc[0].mainwindowhandle);.            showwindow(prc[0].mainwindowhandle, showwindowemum.java);.            prog1 = true;.        }.    }...to clarify why this is needed both application run in a fullscreen borderless setting, and do not have a mouse or keyboard, just touchpanel which is limited to certain commands. creating a touchable button to switch between both programs seems like a good solution."
