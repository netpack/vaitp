"base class property inheriting from base i am doing a code review and have stumbled upon a situation where an abstract class is inheriting from an abstract base class that has a property of the inheriting class. ..at the moment i am unable to debug the code to see how it would work, but i am assured that this has worked in production for many years...as such it is a mystery to me how the following logic would work, step by step...inheritor:..public class inheritor : base {.  ....  properties.  ....}...base:..public class base {.  public inheritor { get; set; }.  ....  other properties.  ....}...how is this possible?"
