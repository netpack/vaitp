"can i access the virtual method of a base class via an instance of its subclass? i have a subclass which overrides a virtual method in its base class which is abstract. .can i access the virtual method of the base class via an subclass instance?..thanks...for example..public abstract class baseclass{.    public virtual void mymethod(){...}.} ..public class subclass{.    public override void mymethod(){...}.} ..public static void main(string[] args).{.    subclass myobject = new subclass();.    myobject.mymethod(); // need a way to refer to baseclass.mymethod, instead of subclass.mymethod()..}"
