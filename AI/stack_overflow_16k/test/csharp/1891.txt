"condition on checkbox my questions is quite simple but i don't find any way to do it...i have several checkboxs, i  want to run my void only if 2 of them or more are checked..private void button1_click(object sender, eventargs e).{..      if (!checkbox1.checked &amp;&amp; !checkbox2.checked &amp;&amp; !checkbox3.checked &amp;&amp;     !checkbox4.checked &amp;&amp; !checkbox5.checked).      {.       messagebox.show(""select 2 checkbox"");.       return;.      }.       else.      {.       //some action.      }.}...is the trick i use to be sure one checkbox is checked.. but i want to do the same with 2 &amp; more checkboxs...ps: i can't use  private void checkbox2_checkedchanged() , i need to use my button1 event."
