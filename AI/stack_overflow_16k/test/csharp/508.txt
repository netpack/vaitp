"passing object reference to method, must it be static? when i'm trying some code to learn about passing a reference of an object to a method, i get an error when i try to remove the static in the methods head. the error message says: an object reference is required for non-static field, method or property...... but isn't there a reference in the parameter already? i have seen code that don't use static, so why does this not work? i know that static is used when method is used from classes that isn't objects. some explanation is appreciated to understand. thanks!..    // method.    internal static string changename(box obj).    {.        return obj.boxname;.    }...edit: i added the whole code. is the problem that i'm calling from inside the main method that is static?..class program.{.    static void main(string[] args).    {..        box box1, box2;.        box1 = new box(""nick"",""r90"",1);.        box2 = new box(""hanna"",""b27"",2);..        console.writeline(changename(box2));.        console.read();..    }..    // methods.    private static string changename(box obj).    {.        return obj.boxname;.    }.}"
