"what does the type system.byte[*] mean and can i cast it to a byte[] without copying? i have an object parameter that is being called via com interop and the type of the object coming in is system.byte[*] and i want to get it to a byte[]; is there a way to do this without copying?..both an explicit cast and the as keyword both fail. the odd thing is that both of those methods work how i want in the 'immediate' window if i break in my function...public void doit(object param) {.    var bbuf = param as byte[];.    // bbuf is null here..    bbuf = (byte[])param;.    // throws cast exception..    // this works, but i don't want to copy.    var abuf = param as array;.    bbuf = new byte[abuf.length];.    abuf.copyto(bbuf, 0);.}"
