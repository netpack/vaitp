"how to build byte array from bytes and nibbles in blank given this structure of a string array..string[] content = {""0x1"", ""5"", ""0x8"", ""7"", ""0x66""};...how to get the content equivalent byte array representation? i know how to convert the ""5"", ""7"" and ""0x66"" but i'm struggling to build the whole byte array representation of the nibbles 0x1, 0x8 in the array... basically i don't know how to concat the ""0x1"", ""5"", ""0x8"" to two bytes.....additional info: the sequence of the string array contains only byte or nibble data. prefixed ""0x"" and one digit is to be intepreted as a nibble, digits without prefix should be intepreted as byte, hex strings with two numbers should be intepreted as byte."
