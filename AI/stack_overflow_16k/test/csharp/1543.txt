"why should i use new vector3? what is the difference? i am completely new to blank, and pretty new to programming in general, but i have been watching many tutorials and going through the steps on my own for about 2 weeks now.  i love watching the tutorials because it allows me to follow along which helps with understanding certain functions. however, sometimes something is presented that the narrarator seems to glide past, and im left just memorizing doing something, but i want to know why...with that said, here is my code to rotate an object.  it works just fine...transform.rotate(15 * time.deltatime, 30 * time.deltatime, 45 * .time.deltatime);...i would like to first know why i couldnt do:..transform.rotate(15, 30, 45) * time.deltatime;...and second, i want to know why the tutorial suggested the below line, and why i should use that instead. .. transform.rotate (new vector3 (15, 30, 45) * time.deltatime);...please help me understand the concepts here!.thanks for your time"
