"how to have different return value to a function in blank i have creating a function to run powershell scripts and i need a way to have different return value types to it. in my situation is or collection&lt;psobject&gt; or collection&lt;errorrecord&gt;...i tried to use tuple, tried dynamic... is there a better way to do that?..this is my code of using the latest approach: dynamic.   ..public static dynamic powershelllocal(string scriptblock).        {.            using (powershell powershell = powershell.create()).            {.                object endresult = null;.                powershell.addscript(scriptblock);.                var results = powershell.invoke();.                if (powershell.streams.error.count &gt; 0).                {.                    endresult = error;  .                }.                else.                {.                    endresult = result;  .                }.                return endresult;.            }.        }...this approach gave me an exception gave me an exception that i cannot enumerate, because then in my code i use for each to iterate through the result. .is there a better way doing that?"
