"is it considered accepted using var's as ""shortcuts"" in blank? one use for the var type in blank seems to be shortcuts/simplifying/save unnecessary typing. one thing that i've considered is this:..myapp.properties.settings.default.value=1;..that's a ton of unnecessary code. an alternative to this is declaring:..using myapp.properties;...-- or --..using appsettings = myappp.properties.settings;...leading to: appsettings.default.value=1 or settings.default.value=1..abit better, but i'd like it shorter still:..var appsettings = myfirstcsharpapp.properties.settings.default;.appsettings.value=1;...finally, it's short enough, and it could be used for other annoyingly long calls too but is this an accepted way of doing it? i'm considering whether the ""shortcut var"" will always be pointing to the existing instance of whatever i'm making a shortcut too? (obviously not just the settings as in this example)"
