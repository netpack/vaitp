"how to programmatically submit a password to a stand alone program in blank i am making a blank application (using microsoft visual studio 2015, using winforms) that needs to open a password protected .docx file in blank. i know you can do:..process.start(""winword.exe"", ""filename.docx"");...to start word (i'm using microsoft word 2016) with that file loaded in. but i also want to submit the password to word so it opens without me doing anything. i know it's not this simple, but this is what imagining right now:..public void submitpassword(string password).{.    process.start(""winword.exe"", ""filename.docx"" //something like this: system.password.sumbit(""winword.exe"", password));.}"
