"what's the best structure to conserve file related information? i am building an interface whose primary function would be to act as a file renaming tool (the underlying task here is to manually classify each file within a folder according to rules that describe their content). so far, i have implemented a customized file explorer and a preview window for the files. ..i now have to find a way to inform a user if a file has already been renamed (this will show up in the file explorer's listview). the program should be able to read as well as modify that state as the files are renamed. i simply do not know what method is optimal to save this kind of information, as i am not fully used to blank's potential yet. my initial solution involved text files, but again, i do not know if there should be only one text file for all files and folders or simply a text file per folder indicating the state of its contained items...a colleague suggested that i use an excel spreadsheet and then simply import the row or columns corresponding to my query. i tried to find more direct data structures, but again i would feel a lot more comfortable with some outside opinion...so, what do you think would be the best way to store this kind of data?..ps: there are many thousands of files, all of them tiff images, located on a remote server to which i have complete access."
