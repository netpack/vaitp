"compare numbers and remove numbers from a text file using blank i have created a text file with some random float numbers ranging from 743.6 to 1500.4.. i am figuring out a way to read the text file (which i have did) and include a number range: lets say( 743.6 &lt;= x &lt;= 800) and remove the numbers which are outside the range and eventually store the final values in a text file...i have managed to write some codes to read the text file so that when i compile it shows the numbers in the text file. now i do not know how to progress further . here is my code, which is able to run compile. this code now ables to read the textfile...743.6 ..742.8..744.7..743.2..1000..1768.6..1750..1767..1780..1500      ..using system;.using system.collections.generic;.using system.linq;.using system.text;.using system.threading.tasks;.using system.io;..namespace readtextfile.{.    class program.    {.        static void main(string[] args).        {.           string filepath = ""c:\users\student\desktop\consoleapp1\consoleapp1\data\textfile.txt""; // file direcotry..             list&lt;string&gt; lines = file.readalllines(filepath).tolist();..             foreach (string line in lines).             {.                 console.writeline(line);.             }.             console.readline();.        }.    }.}"
