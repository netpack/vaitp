"is this opinion true about ""wrapper objects"" in js today, i read some articles about ""why primitive data in blank have properties and methods like objects""?..after that, i understand that when we call a method or property on a primitive data, js coerces that to something like this....var str=""hello"";.console.log(str.touppercase());.// =&gt; translated to:.var str=""hello"";.var temp = new string(str);.console.log(temp.touppercase());.....so we called temp as a ""wrapper object"". once the property has been resolved, the wrapper object is discarded...also..i know that we can doing this manually and declare a variable like temp ourselves. (of course this object is not discarded).....var one=new number(1);.console.log(one);.....my first question. is that object(one) a wrapper object, too?..and my finally question: is this sentence true??..wrapper object is an object which has a primitive data and some property/method about it. this object can create implicit (by js automatically) or explicit (by developer)"
