"any shorter way of skipping a function argument than writing out undefined? say i have this..function isdef(x) { return typeof x !== 'undefined'; }..function banana(a, b, c) {.    if (!isdef(a)) a = 1;.    if (!isdef(b)) b = 2;.    if (!isdef(c)) c = 3;.    ....}...so all of the arguments are optional. if i want to call it with just c argument i'd have to write..banana(undefined, undefined, 5);...which is kinda clunky...sure i could do something like ..window.k = undefined;.....banana(k, k, 5);...but i'd really rather not make short window scope variables. ..in vb.net for example, i could write..banana(,,5)...but js doesn't like that. ..is there a convenient way to do skip an argument in a function call?"
