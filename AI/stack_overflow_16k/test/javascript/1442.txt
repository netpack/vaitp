"is there a way to wait for the dom of a website to be loaded (not the full web-page)? i would like to execute some blank code on a web-page after it has loaded, but only the dom...i have seen that in the past you could use the document.onload event but that it is no longer supported by all the browsers...i have stumbled over this piece of code : ..window.onload = function() {. //code to be executed after the web-page is done loading....}...the issue is that this waits for the full web-page to load i.e. images and other stuff included...is there any other way to do this ?"
