"blank to read a select value in one field and provide a different value in another in very basic language (because my understanding is very basic), i have a select element in a form with the id ""alphascore"" and, based on 3 possible values, translate what is selected in alphascore to a new value in a form element named ""percentscore.""..example:..&lt;td class=""bold""&gt;math test&lt;/td&gt;.&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" id=""numscore"" name=""num"" size=""4"" value=""""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;.&lt;td&gt;.    &lt;select id=""alphascore"" name=""""&gt;.        &lt;option value=""""&gt;select level achieved&lt;/option&gt;.        &lt;option value=""h""&gt;honors&lt;/option&gt;.        &lt;option value=""m""&gt;met requirements&lt;/option&gt;.        &lt;option value=""n""&gt;not passed&lt;/option&gt;.    &lt;/select&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;..&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" id=""percentscore"" name=""percent"" size=""4"" value=""""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;...if the student achieves an h in the ""alphascore"", i want the value in the ""percentscore"" field to be 85, if the student achieves an m in the ""alphascore"", i want the value in the ""percentscore"" field to be 75, and if the student achieves an n in the ""alphascore"" i want the value in the ""percentscore"" to be 10...i keep reading about ""onchange"" and i do understand the elementid.  i can even get blank to copy the value from one field to another.  but i don't seem to be able to wrap my tiny little brain around how to evaluate the entry in one field to create a corresponding value in another field...all help will be greatly appreciated."
