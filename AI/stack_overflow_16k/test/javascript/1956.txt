"regular expression in blank (without jquery)? i am new to blank and recently i wanted to use regular expression in order to get a number from url and store it into a var as string and another var as digit. for example i want to get the number 55 from the below webpage (which is not an accrual page) and i want to store it in a var...i tried this but it is not working..https://www.google.com/55.html.    url.replace(/(d+)(.html)$/, function(str, p1, p2) {.                    return((number(p1) + 1) + p2);...please i need help but not with jquery because it does not make a lot of sense to me."
