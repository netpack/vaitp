"new keyword in js i have been looking at the new keyword in js..i understand this means that the this keyword is now created in the object..one thing i don't understand is how inside the testnew function baz is undefined. ..function testnew().{.    this.baz = ""baz"";.    console.log(this.bar + "" ""  + baz);.    console.log(this.baz);.}..var bar = ""bar"";.var baz = new testnew();.console.log(baz);...as this would now be attached to the new object would this.baz and baz not be the same reference?"
