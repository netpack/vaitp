"blank, creating and listening to a custom event i am having trouble creating and listening to a custom event i have created in blank. i think i am missing something small here, but i am not sure what. here is the code :..document.body.addeventlistener('launch', onlaunch);.function onlaunch(item) {.    console.log(""laucnhed with"", item);.}.function launch(id) {.    console.log(""launch"", id);.    const event = new customevent(""launch"", {activity: id});..    document.body.dispatchevent(event);.}...so the first log ""launch"", and the id shows up correctly, however the second one in the onlaunch function fires correctly, however the item has no detail - logging item.detail is null. what needs to be done to correctly pass that activity property to the listener function? thanks!"
