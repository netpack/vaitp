"why do i need an anonymous function to enclose when calling public method from click listener i have a decent feel for scope and execution flow, but i'm having trouble grasping why this doesn't work:..var modalwindow = (function() {.    // other code....    modalbtn.addeventlistener('click', modalwindow.closemodal);.    return {.        closemodal: function() {.            modalcontainer.remove();.        }.    }.}());...and this does: ..var modalwindow = (function() {.    // other code....    modalbtn.addeventlistener('click', function() {.        modalwindow.closemodel());.    });.    return {.        closemodal: function() {.            modalcontainer.remove();.        }.    }.}());...the first throws modalwindow is undefined. i know i could just declare a named object and place closemodal in it, then reference it, and i wouldn't need the anonymous function in the listener. but i'm curious as to why the latter works as is."
