"blank sort an object with parallel arrays if i have an object with parallel arrays:..var obj = {};.obj['aa'] = [5,2,7,0];.obj['bb'] = ['b', 'e', 'f', 'a'];.obj['cc'] = [12, 66, 77, 43];...how do i sort the arrays based on one of the values? for example, i want the three arrays sorted based on the value of the 'aa' array. i tried ..obj.sort(function(a, b) {return aa.a - bb.a;});...but that doesn't work. it's obviously wrong. please help. thank you."
