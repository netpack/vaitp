"is a blank object automatically created for every html id? i'm giving a blank course, and one of my students came up with a weird syntax that works but i don't understand why. i understand what it does, but would like to know if it is part of the blank standard to react this way, or if it's a firefox ""glitch"". .the question was simply to have a paragraph turn green or red depending if the mouse is over another paragraph. his answer was:.. &lt;p id =""p1""&gt;a text&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p onmouseover = ""p1.style.color = 'red';"".    onmouseout = ""p1.style.color = 'green';""&gt;another text&lt;/p&gt;...what i find strange is the ""p1.style"" part. what is p1? i understand that it is the &lt;p id=""p1""&gt;. but does blank automatically create an object for every id?"
