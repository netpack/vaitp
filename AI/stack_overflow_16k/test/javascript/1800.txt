"how to efficiently evaluate element in blank array by using reduce function i have an array called people which is an array of objects(person's name and his/her city's name), and i want to make a function that calculate the total number of distinct cities in that array. i used a function that use for loop but it seems to be a better way by using reduce functions in blank. here is the snippet....const people = [.  { name: ""jessica"", city: ""new york""},.  { name: ""steve"",   city: ""los angels""},.  { name: ""peter"",   city: ""boston""},.  { name: ""elaine"",  city: ""montreal""},.  { name: ""chris"",  city: ""montreal""},.  { name: ""mike"",  city: ""boston""},.  { name: ""george"",  city: ""vancouver""},.];.let nbre_distinct_cities = 0;..countdistinctcity(people);.console.log('total number of distinct cities: ',nbre_distinct_cities); ..function countdistinctcity(people).{.  for(let i = 0; i &lt; people.length; i++).  {.      if(i === people.length - 1).      {.          break;.      }.      else if(people[i].city !== people[i + 1].city).      {.        nbre_distinct_cities++.      }.  }..}.....i would appreciate if someone suggest an efficient function using  reduce() function"
