how often does a time period occur in two dates? for a small blank rental project i would like to know how often a certain time period occurs between two dates. it is possible to specify how long an object should be rented...there are 4 input fields for the customer:...pickupdate.pickuptime.dropoffdate.dropfftime...the calculation is based on half and full-day object-reservations..1 day:   07:00 - 18:00 = € 30.00.1/2 day: 07:00 - 11:30 = € 15.00.1/2 day: 13:30 - 18:00 = € 15.00.1/2 day: 18:30 - 06:00 = € 15.00...an example of such a calculation:..i rent an object on 12.02.2017 08:00 clock until 13.02.2017 10:00 clock...this would then result in a simple calculation:..1x 1 day   (07:00 - 18:00)   € 30.00.1x 1/2 day (18:30 - 06:00)   € 15.00.1x 1/2 day (07:00 - 11:30)   € 15.00.-------------------------------------.                             € 60.00.=====================================...is such a calculation possible so i can see what an object costs?..i am pleased about references or help..andreas
