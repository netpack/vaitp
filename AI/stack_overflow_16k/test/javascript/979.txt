"is it possible to do item assignment for each iteration in a for loop this is a typical for loop:..for(var i = 0, numitems = array.length; i &lt; numitems; ++i).{.    var value = array[i];.    ....}...is it possible to include the var value = array[i] in the for loop line? obviously there is no performance benefit from doing this. i'm mostly just curious...this does not work:..for(var i = 0, numitems = array.length; i &lt; numitems &amp;&amp; value = array[i]; ++i).{.    var value = array[i];.    ....}...and i know about array.foreach but i prefer for for performance reasons because foreach has to make an extra function call for every iteration."
