"intercepting web browser console messages i'm working on a web app that's going to be rolling out to a few users for testing. there's obviously going to be bugs, so i'd like to capture them to make it easier to develop fixes. is there a way for me to intercept any console messages (both browser/js errors and messages generated with console.log) in my web app, so i can send them to a logging service on the server and have them available for debugging?"
