"weird error msg when using js.call? while debugging i became confused at my error. i'm using firefox+firebug..when executing this code demo i get the error ..typeerror: myranges.call(...) is undefined...code:..var myranges = function(d){.  //return [5,8];.  return d.undefmember;.};..myranges.call(this, 1, 2).slice();...this confused me. when i do a proper return value demo i get no issues with that line (what!?!)...ok so it returns undefined. so shouldn't i get this better error message?..typeerror: undefined has no properties...which happens in this demo..i'm mostly confused at either why i got that message or what does it really mean. i thought it had a problem calling the function or myranges was bad"
