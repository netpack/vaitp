"blank - importing external code during exectuion is there a way, to load some external code during execution of my script? i need something like webpack's require(), but i can't load all the scripts at once (at ""compile time""), because there is way too many of them and it would cause enormous performance issues...in other words, let's say i have some modules:..//modules/module1.js.var module1 = {.    run: function(){...},.    data: ""somedata"".}.//modules/module2.js.var module2 = {.    run: function(){...},.    data: ""somedata"".}...and then main script which is supposed to load one of them..if(load_module_1){.    var module = load(""modules/module1.js"").    console.log(module.data).    module.run().    ....}...can it be done? (i want to be able to load ""module"" into a variable and to keep it isolated from other context.)"
