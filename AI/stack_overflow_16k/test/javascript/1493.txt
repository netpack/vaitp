"blank object enumeration syntax i have this object:..var state = {.  waiting: 1,.  ready: 2.}...and this object for getting texts for the state:..var language = {.  states: {.    waiting: ""waiting.."",.    ready: ""ready!"".  }.}...i want to get the text directly from state like this:..var state = state.ready;..var statustext = language.states[state];...for this to work i need, something like, this illegal syntax:..var language = {.  states: {.    state.waiting: ""waiting.."",.    state.ready: ""ready!"".  }.}...but this doesn't work, what can i use to simply get the text from state variable?"
