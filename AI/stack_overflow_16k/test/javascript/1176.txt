"possible issues with not assign values in blank so i have this piece of code:..function heyho(test){.  var self = this;..  self.yo;..  if (test &gt; 2) {.    self.yo = {};.  }.}..$('.result').text(new heyho(3).yo === undefined)...the output is:..false...as expected, and when the value is less than two the output is:..true...this is also expected...but obviously doing this:..self.yo;...isn't an assignment or a call. is there any performance or other issues tied with doing this?..the point is to have the value to start with undefined, then conditionally give it a value, so i can then do that check later on in code."
