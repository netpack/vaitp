"how to add or adjust this code to also listen for browser resizing? the following code does what i need on my site:..$(document).ready(function() {.  $("".position"").css(""height"", $("".wrapper-slider"").height());.});..it makes my position div the same height as the wrapper-slider...however, if i change the window size, it doesn't retrigger the sizing that that this blank does...i thought maybe adding lines something like this would work:..$( window ).resize(function() {.  $("".position"").css(""height"", $("".wrapper-slider"").height()); .});..however, it doesn't.  i have to manually click reload or refresh on my browser to have the resizing triggered. what am i missing?..if helpful, this was the original inspiration: http://jsfiddle.net/jyu94/..it looks like i could use this too:..$(window).resize(function(){.    location.reload();}.    );..i'm not sure how to combine the two so that its all one command."
