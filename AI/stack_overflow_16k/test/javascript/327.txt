"overwrite function at runtime i am new to blank so excuse me if i'm missing something obvious...i would like to change a function at runtime that is deeply nested in other objects...i'm wondering if there's a way to find out where in the tree the function is located, or somehow translate the breakpoint into a file or memory offset, so i can change the function with a user script once it is loaded."
