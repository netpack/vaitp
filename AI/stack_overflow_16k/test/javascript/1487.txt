"blank - do something when an element in two arrays are the same? i found a solution to where i get returned an array of elements without duplicates:..array1 = array1.filter(function(val) {.  return array2.indexof(val) == -1;.});...however, i want to modify this code just a little bit. instead of being returned an array without duplicates, i want to do something when there is a duplicate. the problem is, i'm not sure how exactly this code works. the thing is i'm not sure how val gets set, or what it even is...for (var i = 0; i &lt; json.length; i++) { .    var item = json[i];.    // if json.indexof(val?), do something.}"
