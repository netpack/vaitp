"blank chilnodes found but not selectable when i run the following code:..console.log(feedinputobj.childnodes);.console.log(feedinputobj.childnodes[0]);.console.log(feedinputobj.childnodes.length);...if outputs:..[item: function]0: div.rssheader 1: div.rssbody length: 2 __proto__: nodelist].undefined.0...so basically it only finds the actual childnodes and the correct number of childnodes in the first output, not in the second or third one. i have no clue how this is happening...update: it also doesn't put the elements in the childnodes object itself...update: fixed it by putting it in the callback. i forgot the object was made asynchronously..i still don't really get why the elements did appear in the first output but my problem is solved."
