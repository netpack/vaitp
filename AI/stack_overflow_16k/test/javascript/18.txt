"cross origin requests are only supported for http but it's not cross-domain i'm using this code to make an ajax request:..$(""#userbarsignup"").click(function(){.    $.get(""c:/xampp/htdocs/webname/resources/templates/signup.php"",.        {/*params*/},.        function(response){.            $(""#signup"").html(""test"");.            $(""#signup"").html(response);.        },.        ""html"");...but from the google chrome blank console i keep receiving this error:...  xmlhttprequest cannot load.  file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/webname/resources/templates/signup.php. cross.  origin requests are only supported for http....the problem is that the signup.php file is hosted on my local web server that's where all the website is run from so it's not cross-domain...how can i solve this problem?"
