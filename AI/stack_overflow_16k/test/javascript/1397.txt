"can i add a setter and getter to a variable without adding any object variables i tried setting the variable directly with get() but i don't know what the correct syntax would be, since it varies, also i tried putting it in an object without a name. this also did not work, if it's not possible is there anything similar..var foo = {.     set (bar){..     }.     get(){.         return 1.     }.}...well originally i wanted to make a value that also appends to all of its values to a array, whenever it was modified . .this was the first thing i thought of,"
