"can't read ""arguments"" from function nested in object as we know, we can pass to function some arguments and then get access to them through arguments, like this:....function test() {.  return arguments.length;.}..console.log(test('param1', 'param2', 'param3'));.....but when the function is an object property, i collided with unexpected behavior for me: i can't get access to arguments inside this function. here is an example:....const obj = {.    test: () =&gt; {.        if (arguments.length === 1) {.            return true;.        } else {.            return false;.        }.    }.};..console.log(obj.test('param1'));.....my question is: why? and is there any other way to get access to passed parameters to this function? (notice, that my functions doesn't accept any arguments in both cases, but in first one i can read arguments, but in second i can't)."
