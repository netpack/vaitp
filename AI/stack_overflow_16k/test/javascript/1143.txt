"how can i redirect a request from consumer to my js file to another folder i have created a blank plugin called ""myapp.js"" and it is hosted in example.com/myapp/ (example.com/myapp/scripts/myapp.js)...i also chose to override the blank file to refer from example.com/publish/myapp/myapp.js using a boolean switch that i maintain in a config file in my web app. ..considering that myapp.js is also consumed by several other consumers, and i wanted to redirect their requests to refer from example.com/publish/myapp/myapp.js and not from example.com/myapp/scripts/myapp.js...how can i achieve this?..thanks in advance."
