"use an object from the parents document inside an iframe? i create an object in a document during thje onload event for the body and then later an iframe.  i need to have access to that object (with all methods) inside that iframe...in the parent document (init.html):..function qvinit() {.qva = new qva.pagebinding('qlm');}...in the body of init.html i then create an iframe and call another html page..&lt;iframe src=nextpage.html&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;...nextpage.html then is a very simple document which loads some blank functions and css and which basically only does a div..&lt;div class=""qvframe"" avqview=""qlm"" avq=""object:.documentch01"" id=""documentch01"" style=""width:260px;height:158px""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;...this div section works well if it resides within the parent document (i.e. init.html). however, i need to put it into a ""child document"" (i.e. nextpage.html) and then it doesn't work anymore. it might be that nextpage.html doesn't know anything about the object, i don't know as i'm still very new to blank. ..does someone have an idea how to accomplish it that i can use the qlm object from the parant document?..many thanks..stefan"
