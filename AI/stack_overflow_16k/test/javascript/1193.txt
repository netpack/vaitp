"what does ""string!"" mean? i am trying to modify the popular energy-skate-park.simulation so that it launches with the grids visible. while looking at the code i came across declarations like the following:..var energyenergystring = require( 'string!energy_skate_park_basics/energy.energy' );..var energykineticstring = require( .'string!energy_skate_park_basics/energy.kinetic' );...i have no idea what this ""string!"" followed by some file path means. is it angular? is it vanilla js feature?..can anyone please guide me to the right direction/documentation to understand these declarations better?"
