"execscript try/catch oddity in ie 8 i am using execscript within a try/catch  block to execute a piece of stringified blank. if the string has a blank error within execscript will return the following error within the catch block in ie 8 on a subsequent reload of the page:..'error: could not complete the operation due to error 80020101.'..are there any other ways of globally evaluating blank in ie 8 which will not throw a generic error like the one above. i know that using eval will not work since it does not evaluate the blank in the global context...below is some setup as to what my code looks like, fn is the string that is to be evaluated:..// fn is defined somewhere above this code..function globalevaluation() {.    if(document.defaultview) {.       document.defaultview.eval.call(undefined, fn);.    } else if (document.parentwindow) {.        document.parentwindow.execscript(fn);.    } .}..return function() {.    try {.         globalevaluation();.    } catch(e) {.       // do some error handling.       // in ie 8 i get the 80020101 error.   }.}"
