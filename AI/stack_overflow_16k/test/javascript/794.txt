"blank recursion and closure? i have this function (sample here: http://jsbin.com/emabe4/ )..var a=[];.var log = document.getelementbyid('log');..function loop(x){..  x++;.  a.push(x);..  if (x &lt; 10){.    log.innerhtml = log.innerhtml + ""&lt;br/&gt;"" + a;.    console.log(a);.    loop(x).  }..}...as the loop calls itself recursively, the array gets longer and is written out with the inner html as such:..[1].[1,2].....[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]...which is how i'd like it to work...but if you look at the console log, this is what you see:..[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].....[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]...the questions:..1) why the discrepancy between innerhtml and console.log?..2) the console log appears to be what is actually being created and i think that's due to a closure problem, correct? if so, what's the workaround for this to do what i want it to do (the former, where i can interact with the array step-by-step as it grows each time)? i've solved this before in while loops, but not sure how to handle it here."
