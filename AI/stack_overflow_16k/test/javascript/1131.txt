"how can i keep same function names meant for different things in their own scope (it may not be the right word)? i have created two different independent scripts to update two different canvas. the problem is that some of the function names in both the scripts are same. this is going to result in conflicts...i could combine them together to form a big script but that will soon become messy if i try to add more functionality. similarly, naming every function differently will be tedious and error prone...is there some way, i can keep the scripts with same function names on a single page without any conflict?..here is my code:..var dropeffect = {..  var dropsize, speed;..  var createdrops = function () {.     var canvas = document.getelementbyid(""drop"");.     .....  };.}...this is the error i get:.. unexpected token name «dropsize», expected punc «:»"
