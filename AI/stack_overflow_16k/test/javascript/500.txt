"blank for loop - execution termination condition i was looking at source code of ext object in extjs docs here and i noticed this for loop:..for (j = enumerables.length; j--;) {.    k = enumerables[j];.    if (config.hasownproperty(k)) {.        object[k] = config[k];.    }.}...so, normally in a for loop, we have do initialization, specify condition and then increment/decrement the counter. i do see an initial condition and j-- which decrements the counter after each iteration. however, what i can't figure out is how is the loop going to be terminated? i neither see any condition nor a break keyword that will terminate the loop...what am i missing here?"
