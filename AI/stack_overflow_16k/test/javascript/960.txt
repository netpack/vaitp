"how this simple blank script actually works (might be scoping)? can anybody break down for me into steps how this (it looks simple in the first place) is interpreted by the browser:..var a = 1;.function b() {.    a = 10;.    function a() {}.}.b();.alert(a);...it will bring 1. if i would change a function name to anything else, etc:..var a = 1;.function b() {.    a = 10;.    function m() {}.}.b();.alert(a);...it will alert 10."
