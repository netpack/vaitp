"var x; ... x.trim(); why sometimes it allows but sometimes it makes the rest of the code stop working? this minor issue causes me 5 hours to fix. finally i figured out. see this code:..&lt;script language=""blank"" type=""text/blank""&gt;.   var x;.   .... // a lot of codes here.   var k=x.trim();..&lt;/script&gt;...the above code made the whole app stop working! ..i remembered that i used to do like that before but got no problem...so, about var x; ... x.trim();, why sometimes it allows but sometimes it makes the rest of the code stop working?..and what is the best code practice for it?"
