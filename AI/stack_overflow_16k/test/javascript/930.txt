"blank inheritance and instance variables i'm trying to understand how inheritance works in js. suppose we have a class:..class = function () {.    this.a = 'a';.    this.b = 'b';.};...and we are trying to extend it..subclass = function () {};.subclass.prototype = new class();...do i understance correctly that after inheritance properties a and b are common for all instances of subclass, since they belong to it's prototype? if yes, how can class be extended so that a and b do not be part of prototype?..upd: note that class uses a and b, so i can't declare them in subclass...thank you in advance!"
