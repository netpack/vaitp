"cross-origin request blocked: the same origin policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://........ i am trying to communicate with an enterprise application from an web application mainly via blank using ajax. i tried a lot to solve this issue but not succeeded. i saw several online httppost tool there i am able to see the response text but it is not happening from my end. each time i am receiving an message like ""cross-origin request blocked: the same origin policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://url. (reason: cors header 'access-control-allow-origin' missing).""..my code:..var url = ""use_url"";.var method = ""post"";..var regid = ""null"";.var uname = ""abcd089"";.var password = ""abcd007*"";.var forlogin = ""10 112 "" +uname+ "" "" + password + "" "" + regid + "" 01"";.var async = true;..var request = new xmlhttprequest();..request.open('post', url, async);.request.onload = function(){.            //http response.            //if(request.readystate === 4 &amp;&amp; request.status === 200){.            var status = request.status;.            var statusdata = request.responsetext;              ..            console.log(status);.            console.log(statusdata);.            console.log(request);..        //}.};..request.setrequestheader(""x-requested-with"", ""xmlhttprequest"");.request.setrequestheader(""content-type"", ""text/plain;charset=utf-8"");.request.setrequestheader(""cache-control"", ""no-cache"");..request.send(forlogin);...i am looking for a solution to get response text. i saw online some solutions but they all are talking about setting response header, but some online httppost sites are working fine on data and producing response text. i am looking solution in blank."
