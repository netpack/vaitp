"for-loop gets stuck on the same number below loop runs once for i=0, then indefinitely for i=1 into a browser crash, i.e. i does not increment:..cascadecomponent: function(item, fn, scope) {.    if (fn.call(scope || this, item) !== false) {.        if (item.items) {.            for (i = 0; i &lt; item.items.items.length; i++) {.                this.cascadecomponent(item.items.items[i], fn, scope);.            }.        }.    }.}...i can avoid the issue by using the frameworks iteration loop. alternatively i have the same loop working with the slight difference that the array is found in item.items vs. item.items.items...any ideas why that happens? it's the same in chrome and firefox."
