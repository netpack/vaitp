"access class property from a function defined in its prototype i am trying to learn oop blank concepts. below is the code of my class:..var dialog = function(selector, properties) {.  this.dialog = $(selector);.  this.isvisible = false;..  this.build(selector, settings);.};.dialog.prototype.build = function(selector, settings) {.  var dialogcontent = this.dialog.html();.  dialog.empty();.};...this is how i initialize the class:..var dialog1 = new dialog("".dialog"", {.  title: ""confirm"",.  modal: false,.  buttons: [.    [""cancel"", ""cancelbutton"", ""no""],.    [""accept"", ""acceptbutton"", ""yes""].  ].});...the console reports that dialog is undefined. how can i access the dialog variable?..see my entire file dialog.js here..p.s. i am currently reading the mdn documentation, but i don't realize where i am wrong in my code. i have also tried replacing this.build() with this.build.call(this, /*..*/), but no result."
