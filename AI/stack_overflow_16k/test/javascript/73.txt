"in what scenarios do you make use of closures in blank closures have always been a catch for me than a feature. but i think it has something powerful to offer. however, i understand it enough to avoid it but not enough to make use of it. which i wish to change. ..so can you give me some examples or situations when use of closure helped your code by reducing size, effort, increasing speed, portability, maintainability...i am in same page with prototype..i know how it works, i know how to use it but i don't in general. my main style of programming is just creating tons of functions. but js offer more features so i'd like to use them."
