"ip address logs and compare i am trying to make small blank ip record and log program which ask user to input ip address and then it checks whether that ip already exist in the array. if ip exist then it tells the user that ip already exist else it adds the ip into the collection array. i have tried several times but it doesn't work. ..var collection = [];.var ip = prompt(""enter ip"", """");.for (var ips in collection){.  if ( ip === collection [ips]){.    console.log(ip);.  }.  else   .  { .    collection.push(ip);.    console.log(ip).  }.}"
