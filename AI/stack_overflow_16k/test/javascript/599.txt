"calling local methods from within a function in a class i am trying to call a class method from within a click function like so:..class classname {.    constructor(element) {.        this.elem = element;.        this.elem.on('click', function() {.            this.notify();.        });.    }.    notify() {.        console.log(""element clicked!"");.    }.}...it does not work, i think because (correct me if i am wrong) using this.notify(); in a function means that it is referring to something within the said function, rather than the class itself. my question is whether calling a class method from within the click function is possible at all? i am new to classes in general and i would appreciate advice. is there a better way to add event listeners to elements from inside the class?"
