"run function if an alert is not showing i've been implementing a simple css &lt;div&gt; overlay when a submit button is pressed on our payment forms. however, i've hit a hitch when combining with client-side blank validation...css:..#ukip-load {.    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);.    text-align: center;.    position: fixed;.    top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;.    padding-top: 50px;.    display: none;.}.#ukip-load i {.    margin-bottom: 15px;.}.#ukip-load strong {.    padding: 10px;.    background: white;.    border-radius: 10px;.}...html:..&lt;div id=""ukip-load""&gt;.    &lt;i class=""fa fa-fw fa-5x fa-spin fa-spinner""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.    &lt;br&gt;.    &lt;strong&gt;form submitting, please wait...&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;.&lt;button onclick=""loadingspinner();""&gt;submit&lt;/button&gt;...blank:..&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;.function loadingspinner() {.    document.getelementbyid(""ukip-load"").style.display = ""block"";.}.&lt;/script&gt;...jsfiddle:..this is the basic concept, and works well for what i need...however, we have client-side validation done through blank alert() boxes, that pop up if certain crucial elements are missing, i.e. the amount of days for their pass is chosen, but the days they then want to attend do not match. these alerts appear at the same time as my overlay...is there any way to amend my function and do a check to see if there is currently an alert() in the window? i would then need to not run (return false?) my function, so they can continue to amend the form...it will only be when the form actually submits that i want my overlay to appear...standard blank only, if possible."
