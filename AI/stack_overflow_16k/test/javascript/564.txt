"passing object in arrow-function in blank i have a really hard time understanding the workflow of the following code-snippet..const circuit = require('circuit-sdk');.const client = new circuit.client({.  client_id: '&lt;client_id&gt;',.  client_secret: '&lt;client_secret&gt;',.  domain: 'circuitsandbox.net'.});.client.logon().  .then(user =&gt; console.log('logged on as bot: ' + user.emailaddress)).  .catch(console.error);...how is, in the second last line, the object user defined? or, asked another way, how can i access user.emailaddress, without defining it beforehand?..this code works, its a sample from the documetation, i just can't get it into my head"
