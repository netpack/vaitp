"using global variable outiside document ready blank? looking trough this site i have seen a number of suggestions about how to update a global variable inside document ready, and then use it outside document ready.  i have tried a number of combinations of these and none of these seem to work.  any help?  what am i missing?..test = 0 ;...or..var test = 0;...or..test;...or..var test;...or no declaration outside document ready at all..then..    $(document).ready(function(){.  test = 4;.});...then later.....alert(test);...output:0, or undefined.  why oh why don't you output 4 like i want you to!  i know, i wish i could just use a normal function where this works easily, but i can't.  i need to use document ready to get some json/jplot material to work."
