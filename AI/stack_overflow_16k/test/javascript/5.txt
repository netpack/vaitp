"array property in objects is there a way to have an array for the property in objects? ..var x = { [100, 200]: [a,b,c], [100, 300]: [a,b,c], [200, 300]: [a,b,c] }...what i'm trying to do is if the property array doesn't exist, add a new spot to the object. the above line doesn't work, so whats the correct way to structure this?..i want to use the object to print out to look like:..100 200 a b c..100 300 a b c..200 300 a b c"
