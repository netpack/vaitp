"how to iterate over array with whole numbers, while adding fractions - blank i have the following:..var arr = [1, 4, 1, 5, 1];.var fractionsum; ..for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) { ..  fractionsum += arr[i] / arr.length ..}..console.log(fractionsum) = nan...why is it nan?  how do i make this work the way i intended it to work which is to convert each item in the array to a fraction and add them up?"
