"debug blank function with parameters i have a website with blank and when i move my mouse on that website, there is function triggered. i need to debug whole blank code step by step when it is executed. i need to find out which function is called (and parameters too). ..how can i do this - what should i use for this? .any real time debugger?..edit: now i see it is script loaded from another url (my site is mydomain.tld, second script loads from seconddomain.tld). second script is obfuscated/minimized and it control clicks on website (when clicked, it triggers one function). .is it possible with blank on my site to call function in that second script? if yes, how please."
