"remove array duplicates by property blank i have a list of objects:..   [{name: ""bob"", age: ""14""}, {name: ""bob"", age: ""16""}, {name: ""sue"", age: ""21""}]...i need a simple way to filter out duplicates with regard to the name property, so:.. [{name: ""bob"", age: ""14""}, {name: ""sue"", age: ""21""}]...there seem to be quite a few array duplicate removal questions, but not any based on a property. it can ignore all other fields."
