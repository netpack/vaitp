"pass-by-reference blank objects .  please read the comments in the code below to know what i am trying.  to ask....expected output: as per pass-by-reference mechanism in blank, objone is expected to log {} at the end, because objtwo was initialized with {}...var objone = {.  x: 1,.  y: 2.};..var objtwo = objone;..// change the x vlaue to 2 by objtwo.objtwo.x = 2;..// change the value of key x in objone as well - pass by reference mechanism.console.log(objone); // { x: 2, y: 2 }../*** pass by reference is understood in code, above this comment ***/..// now what if objtwo initialized with empty object.objtwo = {};..console.log(objone); // { x: 2, y: 2 } but expected output = {}..// as per pass by reference mechanism. objone is expected to log {}, because objtwo was initialized with {}."
