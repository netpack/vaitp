"adding two numbers in blank incorrectly global.alert(""base: "" + base + "", upfront: "" + upfront + "", both: "" + (base + upfront));...the code above outputs something like:..base: 15000, upfront: 36, both: 1500036...why is it joining the two numbers instead of adding them up?..i eventually want to set the value of another field to this amount using this:..mainpanel.feespanel.initialloanamount.setvalue(ext.util.format.number((base + upfront), '$0,000.00'));...and when i try that, it turns the number into the millions instead of 15,036.00. why?"
