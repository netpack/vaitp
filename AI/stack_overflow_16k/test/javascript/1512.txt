"learning blank, how to print out this line only if following statements are true i have too.write a series of complex logical expressions that prints only if the following conditions are true:..if flavor is set to vanilla or chocolate and.if vessel is set to cone or bowl and.if toppings is set to sprinkles or peanuts.if the above conditions are true, then print out:..i'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________...so i entered the following code....var flavor = ""chocolate"";.var vessel = ""bowl"";.var toppings = ""peanuts"";...if (flavor === ""chocolate"" || flavor === ""vanilla"" &amp;&amp; flavor != ""strawberry"" &amp;&amp;.  vessel === ""cone"" ||.  vessel === ""bowl"" &amp;&amp; vessel != ""hand"" &amp;&amp; toppings === ""peanuts"" ||.  toppings === ""sprinkles"" &amp;&amp; toppings != ""walnuts"") {.  console.log(""i'd like two scoops of "" + flavor + "" ice cream in a "" +.    vessel + "" with "" + toppings + "" ."");.}.....and get the following feedback..try again..what went well...your code should have a variable flavor.your code should have a variable vessel.your code should have a variable toppings.your code should have an if statement.your code should use logical expressions.your code should work with flavor=vanilla, vessel=cone, and toppings=sprinkles.your code should work with flavor=vanilla, vessel=cone, and toppings=peanuts.your code should work with flavor=vanilla, vessel=bowl, and toppings=sprinkles.your code should work with flavor=vanilla, vessel=bowl, and toppings=peanuts.your code should work with flavor=chocolate, vessel=cone, and toppings=sprinkles.your code should work with flavor=chocolate, vessel=cone, and toppings=peanuts.your code should work with flavor=chocolate, vessel=bowl, and toppings=sprinkles.your code should work with flavor=chocolate, vessel=bowl, and toppings=peanuts.list item...what went wrong...your code should not pass when ""strawberry"" is used as the flavor..your code should not pass when ""hand"" is used as the vessel..your code should not pass when ""walnuts"" is used as the topping."
