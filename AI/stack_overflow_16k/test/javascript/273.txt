"how to test a regex match to a single character? i am attempting to test a regex against a single character within a string using the following code:..i've attempted to do this using the string.prototype.match method as well as with the regex.test method, to no avail...an example of an input would be ""hello124""..i want the console to log with every uppercase letter, but not with anything else.....function rot13(str) {.  let regex = /[a-z]/;.  for (let i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {.    if (regex.test(str[i])) {.      console.log('match!');.    }.  }.}.rot13('hello124');.....i am never reaching the 'match!' output."
