"how to convert pixel distance to steps ..i want to calculate the step number based on the container width and the distance of the line in relation to the container. ..i was able to calculate the steps, but only with the minimum step being 0. however, in my scenario, the minimum step can be greater than 0 and so far i haven't been able to figure out how to bake that in the calculation...check the full example from this codepen...// small example:.// in this code, line distance 0 corresponds to step 0, but i want it to .// correspond to step 100, since that is supposed to be the minimum step. ..var linedistance = 0; // px.var maxdistance = 704; // px.var minsteps = 100; //step.var maxsteps = 500; //step.var step = math.floor( (linedistance/maxdistance) * maxsteps );...some examples of static values that the step calculation should return:..the end goal is to be able to calculate the step with dynamic values......if line distance is 0, the step returns 100.if line distance is 10, the step returns 105.if line distance is 352, the step returns 300...352 is half of the maximum distance.300 the halfway point between min and max steps..if line distance is 704, the step returns 500"
