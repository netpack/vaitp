"how to determine a value based on dynamic ranges in blank is there a clever way to determine, say an array index, that falls within a given range?  the application is similar to a playlist for a single video file with a set of from/to times that denote a ""chapter""..i.e. chapters:..00:01 - 00:30 : call to order.00:31 - 00:45 : pledge of allegence.00:46 - 02:25 : opening remarks.02:26 - 32:07 : old business.etc., etc., etc....i have a list of these items on the page, and as the player reports where in the video it is currently playing by returning the current timestamp, i need to use jquery to highlight the li of the ""chapter"" in which the currently video timestamp falls.  so if the video is currently at 1:15, that's ""opening remarks"", and the 3rd list item would be highlighted...i've tried a number of approaches, but ultimately use php to write a huge series of if/elses because a playlist could have anywhere from 5 to 100 different chapters in it and can be modified by the user at any time...ideally, i'd like an array using the start time as the key and chapter as the value, and a function that returns the first index that is >= the current timestamp.  is there any clever approach to accomplishing this?  my way ""works"", but good god, its inefficient, running through 100 if/elses 10 times per second...p.s. i should mention that all values are actually in seconds, with the question using h:m:s for clarity.  ultimately, i'm trying to understand how to select an array index if it falls within a given range."
