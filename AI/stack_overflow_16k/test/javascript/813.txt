"blank set attribute using variable i'm unsure of the syntax here, but the code i have so far is this... (note: i am passing the id's of three textboxes in the form '#begmile','#endmile','#totmile', and i want to set the value of the 'totmile' checkbox to endmile-bigmile)..function subtract(begmile, endmile, totmile){.y=$(begmile).attr('value');.z=$(endmile).attr('value');.y=z-y;.$(totmile).setattr('value',???);...}..i'm not sure if my syntax here so far is correct, but assuming it is (that y is properly set to endmile-begmile, how do i use setattr to set the value of totmile to the value of y?"
