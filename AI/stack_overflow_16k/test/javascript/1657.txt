how to get the full target url of a form with get methood i have a form that has a lot of hidden input elements being added to it by blank. i don't have access to the site the form is pointing to and there are a lot of server side url redirects so i can't debug my blank. ..if i set something like this:..$('#myform').submit(function(e){.    e.preventdefault();.    // some way to see the full url where this form would point to.});...it would help me out a lot in matching my url to one provided by the client. ..thanks
