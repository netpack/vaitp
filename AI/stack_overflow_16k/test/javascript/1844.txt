"remove array element with non numeric key i have an array of objects where the key is an md5 string and the value is an object.[0315778255cca8d2f773642ad1d3678f] = {a:12,b:34}. i need to remove array elements based on their key, i tried splice but failed cause i suppose the keys are non numeric. .i also tried to splice by position, but that failed to, and even delete the element but we all know that it is not ideal...i could change my implemantation from array to object but that too will have the same problems more or less i suppose...any ideas are welcome"
