"removing css from blank? i have css style properties ""sprinkled"" through out my blank code.  ..here is an example line:..label_element.style.opacity = 0;...i was planning on moving all css out of the code except classname changes...for example if i need to dynamically change some css dynamically with blank, i plan to consolidate the changes to a classname change as such:...new_class{.    label_element.style.opacity = 0;.}...therefore to dynamically change css all changes are made with class changes as such:..div_el.classname = ""new_class"";...all css remains in the css file this way.  blank only has access to class names...i wanted to verify/validate this is a good way to do it."
