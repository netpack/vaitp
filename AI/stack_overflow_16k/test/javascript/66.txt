"blank does not replace words with german umlaut maybe my approach is totally wrong but i want to split long german words into two with replace so text can be read faster..my code looks like this:..selectedtext = selectedtext.replace(/(sensibilitäts|wahrnehmungs)(w{3})/g,'$1- $2');...so this replaces .wahrnehmungsstörungen in wahrnehmungs- störungen but not sensibilitätsstörungen in sensibilitäts- störungen. why that? it seems that the ä in sensibilitäts seems to make the difference."
