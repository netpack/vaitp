"blank reduce challenge, getting the value of an obj's key i'm following a course online and one of the challenges is this:..write a function called extractkey which accepts two parameters, an array of objects, and the name of a key and returns an array with just the values for that key: you must use reduce...extractkey([{name: ""elie"", isinstructor:true},{name: ""tim"", isinstructor:true},{name: ""matt"", isinstructor:true}], ""name"");..// [""elie"", ""tim"", ""matt""]...i thought i could do something like this: ..function extractkey(arr, key) {.  arr.reduce(function(a, b) {.    console.log(a.push(b[key])).  }, []).}...but its returning 1. i have a general idea of pushing each value into the empty array, but when console logging each value, a will return undefined at the next accumulator."
