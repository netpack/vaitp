"what are the troubles (list) that short-circuiting in coding can generate? i read there are some positions against short-circuiting for code readability. i do not ask opinions here. i'm asking a list of troubles (if any) someone can encounter if they use short-circuiting like:..variable &amp;&amp; dosomething() || dosomethingelse()..or..variable &amp;&amp; dosomething() //otherwise do nothing and continue..instead of:..variable ? dosomething() : dosomethingelse(), if (variable) { dosomething() } else { dosomethingelse }..or..variable ? dosomething() : null //or void, 0, 42, if (variable) {dosomething()}..i've read this answer: omitting the second expression when using the if-else shorthand and i wanted to know more."
