only allowing certain characters i am in the process of creating a form and i wish to validate the input fields onkeypress. i have managed to find blank to restrict a field to only allowing numbers to be entered. now i am trying to adapt that code to only allow letters and a hyphens to be allowed. ..the code i have to only allow numbers is as follows.....     function isnumber(evt) {.        evt = (evt) ? evt : window.event;.        var charcode = (evt.which) ? evt.which : evt.keycode;.        if (charcode &gt; 31 &amp;&amp; (charcode &lt; 48 || charcode &gt; 57)) {.            return false;.        }.        return true;.   }...how would i adapt and change this to only allow letters and hyphens instead...sorry if this question has been asked  before but all i can find is doing it using jquery etc. and i would like to try and avoid that if i can...thanks in advance
