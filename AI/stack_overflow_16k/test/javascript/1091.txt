"pass pointers into function in blank i am very new to blank, and i would like to do something very simple, but i can't manage to..here is my code globally:..var test = class test .{.    constructor(var_x, var_y) {.    this.x = var_x;.    this.y = var_y;...}.};..and..var y = {value: 2};.var test1 = new test(0, y.value);.y.value +=2;.console.log(test1);...my problem is that i display (0,2), and as i incremented y.value, i expected (0,4). .what did i miss ? thank you!"
