are getter/setters really useful? i've read a lot about blank  getters/setters and i am trying to find a good reason for using them instead of just using two methods in their place! could someone give me a small and intuitive example through which their power will emerge and make me understand the usefulness of them? ..no matter how much i searched i did not find such an example...
