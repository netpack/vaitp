"push array into blank object x is an object..let x = {a: [0], b: [1], c: [2], d: [3]}...y is a an array..let y = [4, 5, 6, 7]...what is the proper way to push y into x such that x becomes..x = {a: [0, 4], b: [1, 5], c: [2, 6], d: [3, 7]}...i've done it using for loop but maybe there is a better way."
