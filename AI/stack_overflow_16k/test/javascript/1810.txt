"what (browser plugin?) defines p as a string www311 i have code which declares function p() and it fails seemingly randomly on some users. debugging show that p has already been declared as a string ""www311."". anything in our code does not include such string so it must come from the browser...i'm suspecting a browser plug-in but am unable to figure out what. the following user agents have gathered the aforementioned error:..mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 6.1; wow64) applewebkit/537.36 (khtml, like gecko)..mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 6.0) applewebkit/537.36 (khtml, like gecko) chrome/33.0.1750.117..mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 6.1; wow64; rv:27.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/27.0"
