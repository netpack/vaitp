"data from get request doesn't exist when used in another class in blank i have a function for making get request like this...export class oneclass {.  constructor() {.    this.data = [];..    getdata() {.      let xhr = new xmlhttprequest();.      xhr.open('get', '/data.json', true);.      xhr.onreadystatechange = () =&gt; {.        * push response to this.data *.      };.      xhr.send();.    }.  }...after that i want to use this.data in another class, anotherclass is created on domcontentload..var oneclass = new oneclass();..class anotherclass {.  constructor() {.    oneclass.getdata();.    this.anotherclassmethod().  }.  anotherclassmethod() {.    * use oneclass.data *.  }.}...the idea is that anotherclassmethod() should output oneclass.data as soon as page is loaded but now when it is called array is still empty. ..i understand that my method runs sooner than data is created and that is the reason for it but i'm not sure what to change to make this code work."
