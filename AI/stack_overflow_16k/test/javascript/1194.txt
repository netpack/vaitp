search in a <div> for images and get urls back i want to search a &lt;div&gt; for images with blank. ..i have this code so far: ..function geturl(){.    var dividsearch = document.getelementbyid('uploaded_file');.    var imagesearch = dividsearch.getelementsbytagname('img')[0];.    var imagesrc = imagesearch.src;.    alert(imagesrc);.}...the problem is that this gives me only the url of the first image back. in my &lt;div&gt; can be up to five. how can i get back the urls off all pictures?
