"regexp based string.prototype.split insertion glitch i was working on a parser that could read html however the code that splits it causes ""l""s to be inserted in every other entry of the produced array...the regexp is this:..textarea.value.split(/(?=&lt;(.|n)+&gt;)/)...what it's supposed to do is split entry/exit/single html/xml tags while ignoring tabs and line terminators (it just appends them to tags they were split with)..may i have some insite as to what's happening?.you can view code in action and edit here:.http://jsfiddle.net/termtm/ew7mt/2/.just look in console for result it produces...edit: maxart is right the l in last &lt;html&gt; causes the anomalies to be ""l""s"
