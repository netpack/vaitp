"update div element on the page while looping an object i have a function which loops through an object with many elements using a for loop. while looping through each element it connects to the server and sends some data through ajax, waits for response and then goes to the next element in the object. if the object has many elements it can take up to 2 or more minutes before the looping has finished. i would like to visually show on the page how many elements are left before the looping has finished. ..the problem is that the screen freezes while looping. is there a way to update a div element on the page while looping through the object ?"
