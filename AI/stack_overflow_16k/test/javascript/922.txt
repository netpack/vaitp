"dot operaton in multiple functions calling i was playing with blank and there is this one with thing which is puzzling me.. ..suppose we have two functions ..function a (arga) {. //do something with arga. return somehingfroma.}..function b (argb) {.  //do somwthing with argb.  return somethingfromb.}...if we want to pass return of a to b, we would probably do this b(a(arg)) ..this should give return of function a to b to process? ..now, when we do something like this ..arr.split(' ').join('-') ...we are also pasing the return from split to join? ..i know they both aren't equal, can someone tell me what i am thinking wrong?"
