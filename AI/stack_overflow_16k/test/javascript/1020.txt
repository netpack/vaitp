"calling member function from blank constructor i am running into the following issue which has really got me stumped:..i have ..function systemlist(uid).{.  this.refreshdata();.}..systemlist.prototype.refreshdata = function().{.  this.systemdataobj({}, $.proxy(this.readsuccess, this));.}...when i try and run this, i get the following error: uncaught typeerror: object # has no method 'refreshdata' within the constructor...anyone have an idea why this is failing?  to my eye it looks like it should be working...edit:..example of how i create an instance:..function userminiprofile(uid).{.  this.uid = uid;.  this.systemlist = new systemlist(this.uid);.  this.htmlid = 'user-'+this.uid+'-profile';.}"
