"writing a blank to find sum of a series using for loop i am having a problem in writing a blank for finding the sum of the first 10 natural numbers. i have written the code with a while function and it is working well:..var total = 0, count = 1;.while (count &lt;= 10) {.    total += count;.    count += 1;.}.console.log(total);...i am now wondering how you can do this using a for loop, if it is possible. any help?"
