"assign datas to an object in a for i'm trying to add my loop data to an object...subitem.allavgobj = {};..for(var i = 0; i &lt; subitem.implementations.length; i++) {..if (subitem.implementations[i].avg_score) {..        object.assign(subitem.allavgobj, {.          scoreavg: subitem.implementations[i].avg_score,.          scoreponderation: subitem.implementations[i].ponderation,.        })..    }.}...only, there is only the last object of my loop that is assigned...{. ""scoreavg"": 8,. ""scoreponderation"": 10.}...i tried with an array, and it works (but it's an array with a single value, but the loop works)..subitem.allavgarray.push(subitem.implementations[i].avg_score);...return : ..[.  13.5,.  16,.  8.]...how can i make an object like this?..{.  ""scoreavg"": 13.5,.  ""scoreponderation"": 20.},.{.  ""scoreavg"": 16,.  ""scoreponderation"": 20.},.{.  ""scoreavg"": 8,.  ""scoreponderation"": 10.}...thank you"
