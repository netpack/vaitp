better way to check multiple or condition within single if statement in blank is it possible to further simplify the following blank statement. the requirement is if any input is negative it should execute the statement inside if block. i am wondering if i can avoid &lt; 0 multiple times and just use once..    if (number(cash.value) &lt; 0 || number(cheque.value) &lt; 0 || number(charge.value) &lt; 0 || number(card.value) &lt; 0) {.dosomething();.}...i simplified to this logic..if ((number(cash.value) || number(cheque.value) || number(charge.value) || number(card.value)) &lt; 0)...but it does not work and does not meet requirement. the above logic works but there is duplication of &lt;0 logic
