"why this function is triggered directly instead of by click in blank? i have a object declare like this:..function weapon ( id, name){.    this.id = id;.    this.name = name;.    this.call; .}...then i have created an instance of it:..someweapon = new weapon (1, 'gun');.someweapon.call = function() { //do something };...when i am creating a  element:..&lt;img src='...' onclick='someweapon.call()' /&gt;...supposingly, i will see a clickable image which i can click it to invoke the function. however, the function (someweapon.call()) is called automatically as soon as the image is shown...any solution to this?"
