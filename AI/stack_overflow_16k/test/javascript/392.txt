"push only if property is defined is there a way to fix this condition to remove title from pushing in else part (instead of passing an empty string)?..photos.push({.    title: (this.display_photos[index].title ? this.display_photos[index].title : ''),.    href: this.display_photos[index].path+this.display_photos[index].name,.});...so if the condition in title is not satisfied, i would like to push href only."
