"settimeout in a for loop i am learning about asynchronous programming, closures etc. i have a few current dillemas..here`s the code:..  for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++){.  settimeout(function(){.    alert(i + "" second(s) elapsed"");.  }, i * 3000);.}...i understand that by the time settimeout functions are called, that the for loop is already done (with value i=4). my questions:..1.what are the values of i*3000?  is it :3000,6000,9000 or 3000,3000,3000?..2.settimeout function is in the for loop.if it is called after the loop has finished and closed where is it actually stored? ..3.var i is declared in the for loop. so, when for loop is finished and closed it should be deleted from the scope. how can settimeout functions have access to its value then?"
