"how to account for 0 and 0.00 have a simple script in place that works well but doesn't account for all forms of 0 (0.0, 0.00..etc) what is the simplest way to achieve this? maybe parsefloat?..if(value !== ""0"") {. alert('no sir this cant be empty');. return false;.}...if they put in 0 in the textbox it will return false fine. however, if they put 0.0 it will return true"
