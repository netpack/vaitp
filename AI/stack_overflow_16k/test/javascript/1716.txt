"js shorthand if/else within echo what am i doing wrong here?  no matter what the value of response.count it always outputs the second condition... 'entries have'.  i am familiar with doing this in php, but either i am overlooking something or it is different in js...response.count is returning correct values... ..if (response.success).{.    // show success message.    $(""#dtalert"").html('success! '&lt;b&gt;'+response.count+'&lt;/b&gt;' selected '+(response.count === 1 ? 'entry has' : 'entries have')+' been deleted from your account.');        .}"
