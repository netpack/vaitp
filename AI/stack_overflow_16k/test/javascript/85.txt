"accessing data in an array i have been looking at this and reading for a while but can't seem to understand.  i am sure it is simple but i can not figure out why i can access the data in collection.  i get an error of ...  test undefined...if i move outside of the for loop i can access it just fine.  i am obviously missing something simple. any help would be great...function whatisinaname(collection, source) {.  // what's in a name?.  var arr = [];.  // only change ode below this line.  var test = object.values(source);..  for(var i = 0; i &lt; collection.length; i++) {.    if (collection[i].test === source[0].test){.      arr[i] = collection[i];.    }.  }..  // only change code above this line.  //arr = collection[0].last;.  return arr; .}..whatisinaname([{ first: ""romeo"", last: ""montague"" }, { first: ""mercutio"", .last: null }, { first: ""tybalt"", last: ""capulet"" }], { last: ""capulet"" });"
