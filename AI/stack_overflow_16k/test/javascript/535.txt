"blank planegeometry hide i'm trying to hide a wall of my house, which i'vre created from planegeometries. i want to use the 'o' key to hide and make it visible again. .the problem is, if i'm using scene.remove(groundmesh6); to hide it, i can't make it visible again...my code:..var groundgeometry6 = new three.planegeometry(100, 100);.var groundmaterial6 = new three.meshbasicmaterial({.    color: 0x0000ff,.    wireframe: false,.    side: three.doubleside.});.var groundmesh6 = new three.mesh(groundgeometry6, groundmaterial6);.groundmesh6.rotation.x = -1.0 * three.math.degtorad(90);.groundmesh6.position.y= 80;.scene.add(groundmesh6);..//hide the wall. window.addeventlistener('keypress', handlekeypress);.function handlekeypress(event) {.    var char = event.which || event.keycode;.    if (char == 111) {.        scene.remove(groundmesh6);.    }.}"
