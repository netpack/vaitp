"slice/splice one array into another without modifying the originals i am trying to solve a freecodecamp challenge, in which one array has to be copied into another at a given index, without altering the original arrays. i came up with my own solution, and when i console.log(); wrap each function input, i get the desired results, as far as i can tell. however, it is not passing the tests. i did not use a for loop and tried to make my solution as simple as possible. i will display both my solution and their solution...below is some code highlighting both:..my solution:..function frankensplice(arr1, arr2, n) {.  var varr1 = [...arr1];.  var varr2 = [...arr2];..  var slice1 = varr1.slice(0);.  var endbits = varr2.splice(n);...  return [...varr2, slice1, endbits];   .}...for example, frankensplice([""claw"", ""tentacle""], [""head"", ""shoulders"", ""knees"", ""toes""], 2) should return [""head"", ""shoulders"", ""claw"", ""tentacle"", ""knees"", ""toes""], and it does as far as i can tell when i use the console (does not pass test though for that stipulation)...their solution:..function frankensplice(arr1, arr2, n) {.  let localarray = arr2.slice();.  for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr1.length; i++) {.    localarray.splice(n, 0, arr1[i]);.    n++;.  }.  return localarray;.}...i just don't see a need to use a for loop if i can do it in my simple line of logic. i'm guessing either i am going about it completely wrong or i just have to make a simple tweak to solve the tests. thanks for helping."
