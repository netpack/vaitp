"delete duplicate array elements i have the following loops that goes through an array...for(var j=0; j&lt;10;j++) {.  for(var k=0; k&lt;10; k++) {..    if(final[k]==ya[j]){.      final[k].changerankscore((ya[j].score + final[k].score)/2);..    }else{..    }.  }.}...there are two array with 10 elements. i am checking if there is a duplicate element which is found in final. if yes, change the score of final of the duplicate element and do not add it to final. if no, we can add the element to final. ..one of the possible ways i thought of doing it was, to tag the element to add to the array later. ..is there a better way of doing this?..edit:..final = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 } ; .ya = { 2 , 8, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 } ; ...i am looping through the array ya. if the element is also found in array final, increase the score of that element (since it is an object). if it is not found, just push the element from array ya, to the array final...in this case, number 2 and 7 from array ya are duplicates. consequently, the score associated with those numbers in array final should be increased while the rest of the elements of array ya should be pushed to final. the array should then become..final = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}"
