"settimeout()/setinterval() won't execute. **i am passing the function object - not executing the function the block i'm having issues with is the following:..setinterval(checkinput, 5000);...where..var checkinput = function (letter) {.    console.log(""this executed"").    if (ncorrect &gt; 25).        clearinterval();.    if (document.getelementbyid('keyinput').value === letter).        ncorrect++;.    else.        ncorrect = 0;.}...i have read the so posts where the issue is that the function passed looks like settimeout(function(), 500) and the issue is the (), but i am clearly not doing that. ..when debugging it seems that the function never actually executes at all, and the settimeout()/setinterval() will not wait the given amount of time. i get no errors or warnings. any insight is appreciated. thank you!"
