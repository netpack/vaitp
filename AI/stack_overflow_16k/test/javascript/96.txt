"is there an event that fires when any other event is triggered? i'd like to measure the time it takes for any event (like ondrag, ondrop, onclick, ...) to be executed. since i have a lot of potential events that could be fired in my code, i am looking for a simple solution to measure execution time. i only need this functionality in development, which is why i'd prefer a way without simply calling a method each time an event triggers...so i am basically looking for an event which fires each time any other event triggers and wraps the fired event in a way that enables me to measure it's execution time."
