"should i always use dynamic script tag injection technique for including blank files, similar to facebook? instead of just including &lt;script src=""...""&gt; tag on a page as usual, facebook recommends loading its sdk library in the following way:..&lt;div id=""fb-root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.&lt;script&gt;.  (function() {.    var e = document.createelement('script');.    e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_us/all.js';.    e.async = true;.    document.getelementbyid('fb-root').appendchild(e);.  }());.&lt;/script&gt;...saying, that:...  the best place to put the asynchronous version of the code is right after the opening &lt;body&gt; tag. this allows facebook initialization to happen in parallel with the initialization on the rest of your page....if it is that great then maybe i should always use this method in all my projects for any external blank include? when it is appropriate to use this technique and what are the reasons against it?"
