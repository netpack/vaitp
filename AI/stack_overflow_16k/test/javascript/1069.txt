"how to retrieve variables from two functions to pass through as parameters in final function i am learning blank and i am a little stuck in how to grab the two choices from player one’s choice and player two’s choice to set as parameters in the final function getwinner()..basically just want to do a simple if else statement in the getwinner function based on mychoice and theirchoice but confused on how to retrieve their choices to pass through in the getwinner function...function playerone(mychoice) {..    document.getelementbyid(""playerselecteditem"").innerhtml = mychoice.value;..    const playertwochoice = playertwo();.    const winner = getwinner(mychoice, theirchoice);..}..function playertwo() {..    var items = array(""one"",""two"",""three"");.    var item = items[math.floor(math.random()*items.length)];..    document.getelementbyid(""selecteditem"").innerhtml = item;.}..function getwinner(mychoice, theirchoice){..}"
