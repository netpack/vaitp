"saving a document when opened with window.open in chrome i have an issue with opening a new window with blank. i have html code in a var called ""thecode"";..var j = window.open('').j.document.write(thecode);.j.document.close();...the following code works fine, but in chrome i can't save the new document or view the source code(the options are disabled). in firefox it's fine. is there any workaround in chrome for this?"
