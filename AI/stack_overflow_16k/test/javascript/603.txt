"how do i use a variable to add keys to a blank hashmap ? // create the hashmap.var animal = {};.// add keys to the hashmap.animal[‘cat’] = { sound: ‘meow’, age:8 };.animal[‘dog’] = { sound: ‘bark’, age:10 };.animal[‘bird’] = { sound: ‘tweet’, age:2 };.animal[‘cow’] = { sound: ‘moo’, age:5 };...i'm using the code above to try and create a hashmap. my question is, where sound and age are placed, how would i place them in using a variable...for example..var one = 'sound';.var two = 'age';.animal['cat'] = {one: 'meow', two: 9};"
