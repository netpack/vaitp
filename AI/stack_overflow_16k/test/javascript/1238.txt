"array filter and map at the same time? i feel like an idiot, but i need to filter my array, and then map those values, but thats o(2n) and it would make more sense to do it all in o(n) but i can't find a stock array.prototype function..array.filter(item =&gt; !!item.revenue).map(item =&gt; item.revenue)...i can always write my own method but it would be best to use the performance optimized array.prototype ones, if there is one"
