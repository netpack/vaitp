"i'm not understanding what's going on in this blank object i'm working on some of codeschool's blank exercises and this part has me baffled..in the function dontpanic, i'm not understanding what's going on at the end of this statement ..location.weaponbulbs[location[""ranger""+i].station-1][0]. ...basically, the part where it says station-1. i'm not sure why it's subtracting 1 from the station object. i also don't understand the [0] after station-1. which object or array is [0] referring to?..my guess was the [0] after station-1. is the assigned number for station but i really need some clarification. i don't want to continue on with this lesson without understanding this. i put a comment above the line i need help understanding...var superblinders = [ [""firestorm"", 4000], [""solar death ray"", 6000], [""supernova"",            12000] ];.var lighthouserock = {.  gateclosed: true,.  weaponbulbs: superblinders,.  capacity: 30,.  secretpassageto: ""underwater outpost"",.  numrangers: 3,.  ranger1: {name: ""nick walsh"", skillz: ""magnification burn"", station: 2},.  ranger2: {name: ""drew barontini"", skillz: ""uppercut launch"", station: 3},.  ranger3: {name: ""christine wong"", skillz: ""bomb defusing"", station: 1}.};.function dontpanic (location){.  var list = """";.  for(var i = 1; i&lt;=location.numrangers; i++){.//this is what i don't understand    .list = list + location[""ranger"" + i].name + "", man the "" +.       location.weaponbulbs[location[""ranger""+i].station-1][0] + .
