"search and filter through array blank excuse the title i'm not sure how to describe what i'm doing..i have a textarea where people can write comments but they can also mention people using an @mention system i have made... now my only issue is once the user starts typing after the @ it doesnt narrow down the users so say i have an array of objects like so....users = [.  {.    name: steve,.    id: 47 .  },.  {.    name: james,.    id: 41.  },.  {.    name: guy,.    id: 44 .  },.  {.    name: troy,.    id: 32 .  }.]...how can i filter out users in the array depending on the string thats being written after an @ symbol so if i write @tr in my text area my users array should now look like this ..users = [.  {.    name: troy,.    id: 32.  }.]...any help would be appreciated!"
