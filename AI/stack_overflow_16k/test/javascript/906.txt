"document.location / parent.location - can they be blocked? i am using the above 2 commands on my website. it seems they work for 95% of people visiting the page it should trigger but for others it doesn't...does anyone know if these blank commands can be blocked at all? i am having a real headache finding out why they don't work sometimes...p.s i am not using these for spam or anything, just for processing payments...thanks...edit: i have a  tag replacement for js being disabled. i am thinking more of a random blocking that a user isn't generally aware of. none of the people who have reported the issue would be likely to install a pop up blocker"
