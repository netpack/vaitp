"how can i map the names of an array of objects to change the field names? i am sending data from my client to a method on my webapi controller that accepts a class of responsefromclient. as it's webapi this handles all the conversion from json and changes any field names to match the case convention differences between blank and c#:..public class responsefromclient.{.    public int questionid { get; set; }.    public icollection&lt;answerdetail&gt; answers { get; set; }.    public string task { get; set; }.}.public class answerdetail.{.    public int answerid { get; set; }.    public string text { get; set; }.    public bool? correct { get; set; }.    public bool? response { get; set; }.}...in blank i have an array called ans with each element looking like this:..qs.ans[index].id = element.answerid;.qs.ans[index].c = null;.qs.ans[index].r = false;.qs.ans[index].text = element.text;  ...i need to send the contents of a blank object responsefromclient to the c# server program:..        var responsefromclient = {.            questionid: qs.q,.            answers: qs.ans,.            task: task.        };.        $http({.            method: 'post',.            url: url,.            data: responsefromclient.        })...is there a simple way that i can set the answers field in the blank variable responsefromclient so that it receives an array that contains objects that map to the answerdetail class. in other words i need to change it so that the answers gets and array of objects that are like this:..old &gt; new..id &gt; answerid.c  &gt; correct.t  &gt; text.r  &gt; response...i was thinking to do it like i do where i remap qs.q > questionid. however ans is an array so i am not sure how to do this."
