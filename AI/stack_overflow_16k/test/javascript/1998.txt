"implementing exception handling in blank i would like to know the best and easiest way to implement exception handling in blank. i'm looking for a ""one point"" solution. i've got lot of functions and wouldn't want to go around and implement try-catch. ..i feel window.onerror would be a better approach, since i just have to implement this in one place and any exceptions that occurs in any of the functions, i would be able to handle it using window.onerror. however, this seems to be supported only in ie. is there any similar way that i can use so that it supports all major standard browsers...thanks in advance."
