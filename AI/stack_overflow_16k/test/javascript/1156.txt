"set parameters of width and height for link that will open in a new window with blank? with the following i can open a link in a new window if it has a class of ""open-new-window"". ..  (function () {..    $('.new-window').click(function(){.       window.open(this.href, 'newwindow', 'width=400, height=200'); .       return false;.     });..  })();..&lt;a class=""new-window"" href=""somesite.com""&gt;link &lt;/a&gt;...how can i rewrite this so the width and height of window thats created are passed by parameters in the html? ..so i was thinking something like this: .. &lt;a class=""new-window"" data-window-width=""400"" data-window-height=""200"" data-name="" href=""somesite.com""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;...note - i will need to have multiple links like this on a page, each with different height and width parameters.   ..i also need to centre the popup but i think i can do so with this method once i have he window height and width as parameters..open new window on center of screen with this blank?"
