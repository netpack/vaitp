"how do i replace the port number in blank? i have an array of strings, and i want to create a new array which contains the same strings without port numbers (the port number is a "":"" followed by a number). for example if the string is ""http://www.example.com:8080/hello/"" then it should be replaced with ""http://www.example.com/hello/"". how do i do it in blank? i need it to call safari.extension.addcontentscriptfromurl because the whitelist can't contain port numbers. if possible, it's better to replace the port number only between the second and third slash and leave the rest of the string unchanged."
