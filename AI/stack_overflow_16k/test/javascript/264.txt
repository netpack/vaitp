"how to run a blank function with 1 - 1000000 as arguments i'm trying to find what number between 1-1000000 will return the largest return with a function. i have an idea of how to test each return against eachother, but i'm not sure how to optimally run my function one million times without my computer exploding. is there a basic way to run a function with the arguments 1-1000000?"
