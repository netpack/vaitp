"reporting document-wide blank errors i need a way to log all blank errors that may happen in a document. obviously, an ajax call to the logging script is no problem, but the window.onerror event doesn't fire for errors inside functions or in some other cases where the browser or web developer toolbar would report an error...i'd rather not use try/catch because there's a lot of code in many places and i'd like a document-wide solution that would report all blank errors...is this even possible? i see so many high profile sites with blank errors, so obviously many developers either don't care or don't know about the errors."
