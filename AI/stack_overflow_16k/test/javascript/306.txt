"determine the field that called a function not sure exactly what to ask here, so please be patient...i have an input field, and i need to grab the onfocusin and onfocusout events and perform some logic...i would like to use a single common function to handle the onfocusin, and a common function to handle the onfocusout function...so - how would i determine the id of the input field within the functions?..&lt;input type=""text"" class=""form-control"" id=""location_notes""  onfocusin=""fieldfocusin()"" onfocusout=""fieldfocusout()"" placeholder=""location notes""&gt;.&lt;input type=""text"" class=""form-control"" id=""additional_notes""  onfocusin=""fieldfocusin()"" onfocusout=""fieldfocusout()"" placeholder=""additional notes""&gt;..function fieldfocusin(){.// do some stuff with the calling field.}..function fieldfocusout(){.// do some different stuff with the calling field.}"
