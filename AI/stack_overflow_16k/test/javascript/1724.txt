"how can i locate links involving pdf's on an html page and then append the front of the link with an absolute path? i have an html page with a number of links on it. some of the links connect to .pdf. ..is it possible to write blank that upon the loading of the page -...it scans through the html file and locates all links that are linking to .pdf.then appends the front of that url with a hard coded front end?...all links on the page are relative, and i am having issues when these .pdf links are pulled up on an android tablet. but when i use the absolute path, it handles it no problem. so i just want to append the absolute path on the .pdf links."
