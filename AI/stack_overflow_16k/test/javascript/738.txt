"project euler #16 not working? i was certain i had my code right, however it returns 1364 rather than the correct answer 1366..i tested my code for 2^15 and it returned the correct answer 26. i also tried a few other numbers, all of which gave me a correct answer..i know my code is very elementary, i don't know much blank and i am open to alternate solutions, however i am looking for an explanation as to why my code does not work...//adds digits of this number.sum(math.pow(2,1000));..function sum(x) {.    //the upper limit of the number.    var c = math.floor(math.log10(x));..    //the sum.    var s = 0;..    //the ith digit.    var a;..    for (var i = c; i &gt;= 0; i--) {.        //this works, test by removing the slashes before console.log(a).        a = math.floor((x % math.pow(10,i+1)) / math.pow(10,i));.        s += a;.        //console.log(a);.    }..    console.log(s);.}"
