"show a form filled with blank variables in jquery mobile i have a page which takes data from a mysql database and exports it as json and then displays the data on a page using blank.  ..that all works fine, but i also want to be able to edit the data, and so want to be able to display a form which is filled with the blank variables generated from the json output from mysql. so instead of just showing the table of results, i want to show a form pre-filled with the current values from the json output...i have tried several ways to display the form elements, using the method below it shows the code, but does display the name, if i take the input field out of the single quotes, nothing is displayed...so the picture shows the information retrieved from the database but i would like to show the information in a form...function displayemployee1(data) {.var employee = data.item;.console.log(employee);.$('#fullname').text('&lt;input name=""name"" type=""text"" placeholder=""name"" value=""' + employee.number + '""/&gt;');.console.log(employee.telephone);"
