"freeze blank object i have a class with certain properties and have created new objects based on them. i don't want one object to have certain property added to the class after i have created the object. i have tried object freezing the object. but it does not work. was wondering if there was a way to do so?..function person(first, last, age, eye) {.    this.firstname = first;.    this.lastname = last;.    this.age = age;.    this.eyecolor = eye;.}..var myfather = new person(""john"", ""doe"", 50, ""blue"");.var mymother = new person(""sally"", ""rally"", 48, ""green"");.object.freeze(mymother); // does not work..person.prototype.favcolor = 'green'; // this is reflected in mymother object as well which i don't want"
