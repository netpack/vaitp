"deconstructed parameters as a dictionary inside function let's say i have a function as follows:..function myfunction(a,{b=1,c=2}={}){. //... want to get the values b,c,... as k:v dict.}...is there any way to get the complete map of parameters inside the deconstructed dictionary, as a dictionary object inside the function? effectively i want to be able to access the family of arguments beyond the 1st positional argument to store in memory, as if i were accessing it via arguments[1]"
