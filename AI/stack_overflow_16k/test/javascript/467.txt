"website scrolls bby following mouse .  possible duplicate:.  body scroll with mouse position?  .....i am currently working on a website that revolves around the idea of a cartoon room, and the user clicks on different objects in the room to bring up information. however, i have made the room a specific amount of pixels and sometimes it is too big for a certain resolution, thereby causing scroll bars. i was wondering if there is some blank/jquery that could follow the mouse cursor so that as the user moves around the room, the whole room moves around with them, and the scroll bars can be hidden..any ideas what could do this?"
