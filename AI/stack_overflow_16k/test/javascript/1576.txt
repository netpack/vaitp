"blank: how to add call back that notify after loading a blank file ""async defer"" i am loading platform.js in my app asynchronously by using async defer..&lt;script src=""https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js?onload=onloadcallback"" async defer&gt;.&lt;/script&gt;...i need a callback that will notify me that the lib is loaded successfully or there is an error in loading...is it possible to add a callback in the script tag?..also, as there is a defer then there must be a promise, is't it?"
