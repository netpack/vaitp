"clientx and clienty not giving correct mouse pointer location i wrote this simple code to print a small dot on the location where i clicked with the mouse pointer:-..$(document).ready(function(){.    $('#pane').click(function(e){.        var pixel = $('&lt;div /&gt;').                  .addclass('pixel').                  .css({.                      top: e.clienty,.                      left: e.clientx.                  });..        $('#pane').append(pixel).    });.});...see this fiddle i created. when i click anywhere inside the rectangle, a small dot is printed in that location. but the problem is that dot is not printed where the mouse pointer's tip was. see the below image to see what i meant:-....i tried in both firefox and chrome."
