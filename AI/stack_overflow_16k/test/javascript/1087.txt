"splice returned object has properties undefined. why? let's consider a definition as ..    function stone()  {.        this.x = 0;.        this.y = 400;..    };...i instantiate an object ..var st = new stone;..var ll = [st];..var remov = ll.splice(0, 1);..alert(remov.x);...here remov removes the object from the list but all the properties are set to undefined. the alert will alert ""undefined"". why is this the case?"
