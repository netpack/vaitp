"how to use blank variables within an html string segment i am not sure how to phrase this question better but basically i am trying to do this:..v = v.replace(codelist[i], ""&lt;a href={converted}&gt;{codelist[i]}&lt;/a&gt;"");...as you can see i'm just using regex to search for a certain string, and then replacing that string with a link. the problem here is ""converted"" and ""codelist[i]"" which i bracketed are variables, and i have no idea how to access them in this context...i feel like i am missing something incredibly obvious here. apologies if this is a duplicate question...edit: this was marked as a duplicate for a question about string concatenation, which works to solve this problem as well, though it is far less elegant than the template strings solution."
