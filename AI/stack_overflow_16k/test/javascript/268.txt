"blank parsefloat parseint i'm learning blank...what does it mean to have parsefloat &amp; parseint functions in blank, when in fact, blank does not differentiate between float and integer--there is only the numeric data type...seems like they should have created parsenumber to be in alignment with their data types...any comments?  maybe somebody knows the reason.  it just seems very odd."
