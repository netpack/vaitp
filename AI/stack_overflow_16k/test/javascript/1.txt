"calling arbitrary function with blank 'apply' i want to pass a varying number of argument to varying functions. i set up this basic test:..function overview(arg1, arg2, arg3) {.    console.info('arg1 is ' + arg1);.    console.info('arg2 is ' + arg2);.    console.info('arg3 is ' + arg3);.}..function modules(method, args) {.    this[method].apply(null, args);.}..modules('overview', new array('test1', 'test2'));â€‹...so, i use 'apply' to pass an array with arguments via the 'modules' function to the 'overview' function. this works fine, except for the this[method] part. i read about this in this q&amp;a: calling dynamic function with dynamic parameters in blank and it seems marvelous. however, i keep getting 'typeerror' errors and i can't figure out how to resolve this.  ..of course, i could use a switch within the modules function to call the correct method, but that is unnecessary bulk (hopefully!). i've made a jsfiddle to 'fiddle' with: http://jsfiddle.net/qfprc/. hope anyone can solve and/or explain this."
