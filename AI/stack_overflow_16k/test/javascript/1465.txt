"calculate quotient with logarithm log2 i have to calculate a simple quotient: ..log2(val1) / log2(val2)...iÂ´ve tried to this with:.. var valueone = math.log2(val1);. var valuetwo = math.log2(val2);. var quotient = valueone / valuetwo;...unfortunately,it do not work.as i found out, there are obviously browser compatibility problems with math.log2..in chrome, i get *'uncaught typeerror: undefined is not a function'* ..how can now calculate the quotient?"
