"how do i execute timed tasks in sequence? how do i make a variable number of timed tasks run sequentially using blank?..i'm working on a recreation of the classic electronic memory game simon for a challenge at free code camp. i'm using the web audio api to generate the sounds and i need to time them correctly...i need to start a sound, wait for 420ms, stop the sound, then wait for 500ms before starting the next sound...i can get it to work just fine with settimeout when i only need to play a single sound, but i can't figure out how to make it wait to play the subsequent sounds...here's a subset of the code that shows the problem. it works fine with 1 sound, but when there's more than one it ends up playing all of them (except for the first?) at the same time:....var audiocontext = new audiocontext();.var oscillator = null;..function playsound(frequency) {.  oscillator = audiocontext.createoscillator();.  oscillator.type = 'square';.  oscillator.connect(audiocontext.destination);.  oscillator.frequency.value = frequency;.  oscillator.start();.}..function stopsound() {.  oscillator.stop();.  oscillator.disconnect(audiocontext.destination);.  oscillator = null;.}..var frequencies =  [329.628, 220, 277.183, 164.814];..var turn = 1;.var soundcounter = 0;..var duration = 0;.if (turn &lt;= 5) {.  duration = 420;.} else if (turn &lt;= 13) {.  duration = 320;.} else {.  duration = 220;.}..for (var i = 0; i &lt; turn; i++) {.  var freqid = math.floor(math.random() * frequencies.length);.  var frequency = frequencies[freqid];.  playsound(frequency);.  settimeout(function() { stopsound(); }, duration);.}.....thank you...update: finished!..i couldn't have completed this without the excellent answers provided by @ryanzim, @trincot, and @lee-daniel-crocker. none of the answers were directly usable with copy &amp; paste and that's a good thing because i'm supposed to be learning something :d  i learned from and used bits from all the answers. so needs to have a way to select more than one correct answer for cases like this...curious? http://codepen.io/vaggrippino/pen/wobqxr..the code is sloppy in some places, but it works and i'd rather move on than perfect it right now."
