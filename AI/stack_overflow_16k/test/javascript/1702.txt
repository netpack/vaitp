"blank: changing a positive number to a negative? i have been trying to do the following - change a positive to a negative number...it appears there are a number of ways to do this. there is the standard..x *= -1...or just placing a negative sign in front the variable i.e if x = 5, then -x is equal to -5...this seems a great shorthand but wanted to know what the difference is, i can't find any documentation regarding this shorthand on mdn...i assume there are other ways too...probably a basic question but it is annoying not understanding this apparent shorthand...any ideas ?"
