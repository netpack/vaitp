is observer pattern unidirectional or bidirectional data flow i intend to use observer pattern to update views automatically once value of model has been changed. it's obvious that a model is observable (subject) and dom elements are observers that are staring at model for any changes so that they can update themselves...but do you think it is still unidirectional data flow if i have a button which is observing model value and on click modify model value
