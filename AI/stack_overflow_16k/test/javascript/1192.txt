"promise in while loop blank i'm trying to generalize a script that encrypts forms using openpgp libraries..i got some troubles with the client-side code (blank) :..var working = formid.elements[0];.var counter = 0;..while (working) {.    encrypt(working.value).then(function(encrypted_msg) {.        console.log(""processing"");.        working.value = encrypted_msg;.    });.    console.log(""assuming processed"");.    var counter = counter + 1;.    var working = formid.elements[counter];.}...the following code should take each form element and encrypt its value. however, the while loop doesn't wait for the asynchronous encrypt() function to be resolved...i think i need to use promises in this case, but i have no idea how and the few tutorials didn't work in a while loop...help ?"
