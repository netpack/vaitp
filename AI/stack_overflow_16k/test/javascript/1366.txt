"hiding divs dynamically using a search jsfiddle for what i have done so far http://jsfiddle.net/chq2t/3/..as you can see, i have some divs arranged thus....&lt;div id = ""container""&gt;.    &lt;div id = ""abc"" class = ""box""&gt;.        abc        .    &lt;/div&gt;.    &lt;div id = ""cde"" class = ""box""&gt;.        cde.    &lt;/div&gt;.    &lt;div id = ""efg"" class = ""box""&gt;.        efg.    &lt;/div&gt;    .&lt;/div&gt;...and there is a search box where i want to dynamically hide and show divs based on the search query (executed after every stroke) and the div id. so typing c should hide all divs where the id does not contain substring ""c"" i.e. the last one...typing d after that should hide the additional div abc, since it does not contain the substring ""cd"". backspace should restore it. so basically it's a standard dynamic search...what is missing are the blank functions for hiding and showing...function hide_divs(search) {.    $(""#container"").not(""#""+search).hide();.}..$(document).ready(function() {.    $(""#search_field"").keyup(function() {.        var search = $.trim(this.value);.            hide_divs(search);.    });.});...i am struggling with restoring the previously hidden divs."
