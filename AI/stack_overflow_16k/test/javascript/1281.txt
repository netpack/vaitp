"how to replace two eval() in a comparison in the following snippet of code:..    case ""lessthan"": {.        if (eval(firstvalue) &gt;= eval(secondvalue)) {.            compare = "" should be less than "";.            compreturn = false;.        }.        break;...i would like to remove the eval() parts for more efficient code, where the contents are expected to be numbers. i've read other similar questions which i don't understand, so i hope this is a simple case!.i'm starting with..     if parsefloat(firstvalue) &gt;= parsefloat(secondvalue) {...but having read so much about eval() i have a feeling i'm missing something."
