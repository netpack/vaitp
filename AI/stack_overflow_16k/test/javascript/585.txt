"blank: document.write function have redefined, how can i recover it when i visit some website(such as: https://www.baidu.com) and open browser dev tool, i found they have redefined function ""document.write"" as:....document.write.//output: Æ’ (){}...    ..yes, they have replaced ""document.write"" with a ""blank"" function..so my question is: how can i recover ""document.write"" to original function?"
