"declaring and testing local variable in if statement i'm in need to declare a local variable and test for it inside of condition of if statement. i want to be able to do it as it is possible like this, however i need to do it without global scope; is this possible?..notworkingsofar('#element');.function notworkingsofar(a) {.   if(!(b=document.getelementbyid(a.slice(1)))){return b;}.   else{return false;}.}...i need it to basically do this; however that gives syntaxerror...notworkingsofar('#element');.    function notworkingsofar(a) {.       if(!(**var** b=document.getelementbyid(a.slice(1)))){return b;}.       else{return false;}.    }...is there any other way to access or set local variables, other then by ""var variable=""? maybe by function.variable, akin to window.variable... not sure though. ..edit: trying to do it inside a chain of these: (!!(b = document.getelementbyid(a.slice(1)))?b:[0,])"
