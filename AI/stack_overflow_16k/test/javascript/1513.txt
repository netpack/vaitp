"how do i create a js script that repetitively presses a key multiple times i am new, very, very new to js. i don't even know the basics, but i just want help with a quick short script.  ..it is supposed to be a simple script that spams a key with tampermonkey...this is what i have so far:..// ==userscript==.// @match        *://diep.io/*.// @grant        none.// ==/userscript==..(function() {.    function f(e){.        var a = new keyboardevent(""keydown"", {.            bubbles: true,.            cancelable: true,.            shiftkey: false.        });.        delete a.keycode;.        object.defineproperty(a, ""keycode"", {.            ""value"": 220.        });.        dispatchevent(a);.    }.    function a(e) {.        addeventlistener(e, f);.    }..    for(var i of [""focus"", ""blur"", ""keyup""]) {.        a(i);.    }.}());...instead of pressing keycode 220 down repeatedly, it holds it down. can you fix it so that the key is ""being spammed,"" at a fast pace?"
