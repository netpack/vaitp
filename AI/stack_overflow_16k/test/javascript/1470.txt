"multiple conditions in blank i have created the blank based demonstration and now i want to hide an image on click in certain condition only...    $(""#clear"").click(function(){                .     if ($('#image').is("":visible"") &amp;&amp; ('#image2').is(""hidden"")) {.       $(""#image"").hide();.      }; .    });...as you can see my code is not right, so i want to know how to format my code properly. i couldn't find the right way to write multiple conditions in one string. thanks in advance."
