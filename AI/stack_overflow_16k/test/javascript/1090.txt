"select inputs that doesn't have value attribute with queryselector i'm using:..document.queryselectorall('input[value=""""]')...but it's not selecting inputs that doesn't have the attribute value..how can i select all inputs that doesn't have a value '', and that doesn't have the attribute value?.i would like to do that without jquery and without any additional function, would that be possible only using queryselectorall?"
