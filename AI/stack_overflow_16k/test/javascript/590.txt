"how to write a time delay which doesn't freeze the ui of the website? i want to make a time delay in my website. so far i have built a sleep function which can freeze my system for number of seconds. but with this, i'm not able to my access the user interface of the website...my code:....&lt;html&gt;.&lt;head&gt;.    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;.&lt;/head&gt;.&lt;body&gt;.    &lt;button onclick=""on_click()""&gt;button-1&lt;/button&gt;.    &lt;button onclick=""console.log('bye');""&gt;button-2&lt;/button&gt;.    &lt;script&gt;.        function on_click().        {.            sleep(15000);.            console.log(""hi"");.        }.        function sleep(delay).        {.            var start = new date().gettime();.            while (new date().gettime() &lt; start + delay);.        }.    &lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;.....so whenever i click button-1, i'll have to wait for the 15 seconds to click the button-2. i want my program to allow me to click on button-1 and it should wait for 15 seconds and display ""hi"" on the console. and also allowing me to click button-2. please help. thanks"
