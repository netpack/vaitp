"learning blank by reading first or writing first? i did check (and read) a few similar questions here, but this really applies to everyone differently since no one learns the same...my question is not on what resources to use, for that i have plenty...i am working my way through blank: the definitive guide (and i have the good parts as well)...i'm reading up on the core language but i don't feel like the information is sticking (or rather i'm not getting much out of it). ..my question is should i just write an application in blank and reference my books (i'm a very hands on person, but do enjoy reading), or should i keep reading the book, do the exercises, and then write a program?..in short: should i just write js app first and reference my book, or read the book first doing the examples and then write a js application? i've done some basic programming in php/python (nothing meaningful yet)...i always learn math this way and i suppose, i'm conflicted in how i should tackle learning a language. i feel like i could read many books, but perhaps this isn't the best way for me (i know others learn differently)...for starts, i'm considering writing a simple calculator in js."
