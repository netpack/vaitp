"check what text is after certain text i was wondering because i am making a website and i need to make blank code that checks what text is going aftet certain text, i think i need to give an example, so:..a= txt...a= - the certain text that shows what text to copy, in this case the text that needs to be copied is txt..so the problem is: i don't know how to check if there is a= in the textarea and then take text as a variable txt..function formanswer() {.    var a = document.getelementbyid('textarea').innerhtml = ""a="";.    var ans = document.getelementbyid('textarea').value;..    var answer = document.getelementbyid('answer').innerhtml = a + 'ans';.}...this is what i've done so far, but its probably garbage, not code."
