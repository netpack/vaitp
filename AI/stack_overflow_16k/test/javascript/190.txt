"blank questions: how does this code work? apologies for the vague question but i have been racking my brain as to why my code did not work for two hours and after the two hours i finally got it to work. only i have no idea why it works now. heres the scenario. ..i have a ""people"" object that has person 1, person 2, and person 3, in it with various keys. i have a button that loops throught people object and places person1, person2, etc into a table ""row"". (person1,etc all have a radio button in the first ""td"" in their respective rows.)..i then click a button which checks if i selected one of the radio buttons mentioned above. upon button press it loops through the object again primarily because i am using ""document.getelementbyid"" to identify the radio buttons. by looping through the people object i can the below:..for (var property in people) {.var radiobutton = document.getelementbyid(property + ""radio"");.    if (radiobutton.checked === true) {.    sessionstorage.setitem(""macomcode"", selectmacomfield.value);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""displayname"", people[property].displayname);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""dodid"", people[property].edipi);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""ptc"", people[property].ptc);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""email"", people[property].email);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""emailserviceclass"", people[property].serviceclass);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""mobileserviceclass"", people[property].mobileserviceclass);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""rms"", people[property].rms);.    sessionstorage.setitem(""journaling"", people[property].journaled);.    window.open(""depo/williamdepopage.html"",'_blank');//'width = 930, height = 700'*/.    break;.    }.}...basically the above code loops through the people object checking if the radiobutton was checked. it then stores the respective keys found in the people object into the sessionstorage and opens a window where the information will be populated. the break ensures that the code doesn't repeat after a match has been found...the thing i noticed though with the above code is that it would only work when person1 was on the field. so if i just had person3 on the field it would throw an error of ""cannot get id of null"" (referring to the radiobutton). same goes for when i only had person2 on the field. but as long as person1 was on the field with person2 and person3 it worked perfectly. ..after a bunch of tinkering i came up with this code:..for (var property in people) {.var radiobutton = document.getelementbyid(property + ""radio"");.if (radiobutton !== null) {.if (radiobutton.checked === true) {.sessionstorage.setitem(""macomcode"", selectmacomfield.value);.sessionstorage.setitem(""displayname"", people[property].displayname);.sessionstorage.setitem(""dodid"", people[property].edipi);.sessionstorage.setitem(""ptc"", people[property].ptc);.sessionstorage.setitem(""email"", people[property].email);.sessionstorage.setitem(""emailserviceclass"", people[property].serviceclass);.sessionstorage.setitem(""mobileserviceclass"", people[property].mobileserviceclass);.sessionstorage.setitem(""rms"", people[property].rms);.sessionstorage.setitem(""journaling"", people[property].journaled);.window.open(""depo/williamdepopage.html"",'_blank');//'width = 930, height = 700'*/.break;.}.}.}...all i added was the:if (radiobutton !== null) { and i can now pull up person3, and person2 by themselves and no error occurs. i understand that this checks if a radiobutton is on the screen but i do not understand what roll it plays in the entire scheme of the above code. to me its saying if ""radiobutton"" exists on the page execute the code. well even before i input the if(radiobutton !== null) the radiobutton was already on the screen but an error was being thrown saying that radiobutton was null...sorry for the long post but can anyone tell me what the if(radiobutton !== null) does to make this code work? i'm glad it does, i'd just like to know why it works all of a sudden...appreciate the time and the assistance."
