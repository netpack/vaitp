"blank var declaration vs equivalent this could be insanely inane... but i am still learning...let's take the lesson from code academy(since i am literally learning at that low of level) at section 1 lesson 28...instructions:.write your own if / else statement..the only instruction is that the result of evaluating the statement is a log to the console of ""i finished my first course!""...i wrote:..var num = 1;..if(num = 2){.console.log(""testing fail"");.}.else{.console.log(""i finished my first course!"");.} ...this did not work... but after thinking a moment i gave a shot..var num = 1;..if(num == 2){.console.log(""testing fail"");.}.else{.console.log(""i finished my first course!"");.}...this worked. so. i named my variable num and set it equal to 1. i then said if num is equivalent to 2 then the console.log would write ""testing fail"" -  else it writes ""i finished my first course!"".....it doesn't explain why my first try didn't work..i declared my variable to equal one, but then i said in my if/else statement that if my variable equaled 2 then to do the condition. why can i not declare a statement twice, or at least in a conditional statement? ..i am missing the logic here... probably simple but i am learning."
