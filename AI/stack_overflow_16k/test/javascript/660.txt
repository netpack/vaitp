"issue with hoisting in blank i am trying to solve few coding snippets and found the following snippet little tricky...var x =100;.function test() {.  if(false) {.    var x = 200;.  }..  console.log(x);.}.test();...i expected that it will console 100 but instead it is printing undefined, i really dont understand how the hoisting is happening here as the false block will never execute. could some one help me know the logic here."
