"speeding up jpg ""videos"" pulled from a proxied web cam? i have a snippet of blank that is used to pull a series of jpg's from a webcam that is inside our network. right now it's being reverse-proxied through apache2 and embedded in our website...the thing is that to keep the display from ""freezing"" with timeouts i've had to adjust the consultant's snippet to 2 seconds. someone suggested that it would be possible to cache some of the data better and speed it up with the proper blank coding...what i have now is:..&lt;center&gt;.&lt;img id=""video"" src=""../../img/unconnected.jpg"" alt=""video"" height=""480"" width=""640"" /&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;.&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;// &lt;![cdata[.var sourceimage = ""http://www.ourwebsite.com/video/link/image.cgi?v=jpg:640x480&amp;seq=1"";..function show() {.    document.getelementbyid(""video"").src = sourceimage + math.random();..    settimeout(show, 2000);.}..show();.// ]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;...is there a way to do this?"
