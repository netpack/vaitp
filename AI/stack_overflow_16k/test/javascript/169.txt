"can i have a blank/node backend without running a server on top of it? edit..my previous question was a bit unclear, i'll try to rephrase..here's my need:...i have a content accessible behind authentication (specifically ibm portal).i have to expose just this specific content, to put it in a news monitor inside the intranet.this portal is also accessible on internet.i'd like to have a simple page that makes the required authentication, gets the content and gives it back for showing.i don't want to have security risks (i don't want to alter ibm portal security for just 1 content, i don't want to risk that user/password used for authentication are exposed.i don't want / hardly can add another server / service...this ideally should be standalone (i have a web app server but i cannot use it, and i don't want to install a brand new one)...thank you in advance!..============================..old question..i'm asking a rather odd question..i'd like to build a very very small piece of code (i asked blank, but not bound to it) that makes an authentication to a service, gets some info and gets them back..now, i care about the following:...i need to access this code with an http call, be it a page with some js calling it or whatever.do not add more servers/services running that someone needs to manage (this has to work ""serverless"").since i'm gonna make an authentication, i don't want this piece of code to be available to someone calling it, hence why this needs to stay on the server, be ""callable"" but not downloadable...is it possible to achieve something like that? or do i need a server/api in order to do such operation ""safely""?..thank you in advance!"
