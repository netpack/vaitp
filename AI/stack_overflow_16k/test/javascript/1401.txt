"substring with inconsistent length i have this quite long string that contains multiple information. so i guess we can say that its a couple of fields concatenated together without any delimiters. i understand that to make this work, all of the lengths of the fields should always be fixed. however, two of the fields represent a name and an amount and no prefixes/suffixes were implemented to maintain a fixed length...i was wondering how would i got about this problem? here's a sample of the string and how they should be separated:..sample #1...  actual input:.  48001mcabastillas2200800046300017100518110555130000123.  how it should be separated:.  480 | 01 | mcabastillas | 2200800046300017 | 100518 | 110555 | 130000 | 123...sample #2...  actual input:.  48004mcabastillas22008000463000171005181105555000000123.  how it should be separated:.  480 | 04 | mcabastillas | 2200800046300017 | 100518 | 110555 | 5000000 | 123...in my example only the amount has changed but i'm expecting that the name will vary in length as well. any suggestion will be much appreciated."
