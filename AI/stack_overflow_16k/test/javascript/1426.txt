"multiple single onclick events i'm just messing around on blank. i want to create two single on-click buttons, each which serve separate functions. however, the first button's response is always that of the second if that group of code is in. it works fine independently. ..i've double checked online and tried a few functions, but everything comes back to multiple-function buttons..i'm not super advanced and i just do random programming for fun. ..if the yes button is clicked, then ""good"" should appear. if the no button is clicked, then ""bad"" should appear. .when both groups of code are together, ""bad"" is always shown, regardless of the button shown. if only the first group of code is isolated, then the result is ""good"".....function myfunction() {.  var str = ""good"";.  var result = str.link(""https://www.allrecipes.com/search/results/?wt=authentic%20taco%20recipes&amp;sort=re"");.  document.getelementbyid(""happy"").innerhtml = result;.}.&lt;/script&gt;               .&lt;button onclick=""myfunction()""&gt;no&lt;/button&gt;..&lt;p id=""sad""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;..&lt;script&gt;.function myfunction() {.  var str = ""bad"";.  var result = str.link(""https://www.tacobell.com/"");.  document.getelementbyid(""sad"").innerhtml = result;.}.do you like tacos?.&lt;br /&gt;                 .&lt;button onclick=""myfunction()""&gt;yes&lt;/button&gt;..&lt;p id=""happy""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
