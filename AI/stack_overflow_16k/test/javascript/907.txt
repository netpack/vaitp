"best way to search the the second array in a multidimensional array i have a grid of values, represented by a two-dimensional array...here is a literal representation of the data: datavalues[row][column]..so datavalues[3][0] would be the fourth row, first column...well, i need to search the first column of every row for a value and i'm looking for the least computational intensive way of doing that...i know i can do it with a loop:..for (var i in datavalues) {.  if (datavalues[i][0] == ""totals"") {.    matchingrow = i;.    break;.  }.}...but i like to avoid loops wherever possible and i can't think of a way to apply array.prototype.indexof in a useful way here...is there even a computational difference between a loop and indexof? it seems to me that indexof would probably just run its own loop."
