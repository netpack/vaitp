"blank code runs only when file saved at certain location i have created some htm pages with blank code which i saved on my windows desktop. the code runs fine after i confirm a prompt to run scripts or active x, but as soon as i copy the file over to a network location (not a server) and try to open the file, blank does not run any more (the prompt mentioned above does not appear). i did not have this problem with other code (including blank) and i am not sure what the problem is - probably something around network safety settings?  ..specifically, the following snippet seems to cause the problem: ..&lt;div class=""dropdown""&gt;.&lt;button onclick=""myfunction()"" class=""dropbtn""&gt;dropdown&lt;/button&gt;.  &lt;div id=""mydropdown"" class=""dropdown-content""&gt;.  &lt;/div&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;..function myfunction() {.    document.getelementbyid(""mydropdown"").classlist.toggle(""show"");.} ...show {display:block;}...the button shows, but the dropdown menu does not show up when the file is saved on the network drive. so function myfunction() does not work apparently."
