"working out co-ordinates of a grid in blank? if i have a grid of 3 x 3 of 50 pixel squares which are numbered 1-9 horizontally, like below;..| 1 | 2 | 3 |..| 4 | 5 | 6 |..| 7 | 8 | 9 |..if i know the number of the square say for instance square 9, and the width of the squares in this instance 50 pixels, how can i programmatically work out the co-ordinate of the square based on a co-ordinate system of 0, 0 starting from the top left...square 9 in this case would be x = 100 and y = 100,..i have tried this so far but it fails,..x = (squarenumber * squarewidth).y = (squarenumber * squareheight)"
