"limit decimal places to specific situations (not round) im looking  to limit a number do 2 decimal places, but only when the rest is zero. i dont want to round the numbers...i tried using this example .(1.0000).tofixed(2) .the result would be 1.00, but if i have a number like (1.0030).tofixed(2), the result should be 1.003...i tried using parsefloat with a combination of tofixed but doesnÂ´t get the result i want...is there any function in blank that does what im trying to achieve."
