"blank pass a variable to another page ok, here is what i want to do. i have a very complex database. i am reading from the database using php and store the data in a variable (ajax). now when i go to another page i loose the variable...here is what i know (not sure how correct i am): the scope of a variable is the function it is in. if not specified the scope will be the window object (which changes for every page). is there any higher level than window? (something like session in php but in the client side)"
