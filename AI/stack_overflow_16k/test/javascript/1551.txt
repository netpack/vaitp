"yet another uncaught typeerror: : cannot read property 'replace' of undefined i am writing a bit of js code to switch classes for certain dom elements..everything is working as it should, but i am also getting this error and this.prevents the code that follows to be executed...i added a check to make sure that the array of elements is not empty as i thought.this was the problem. but still the error occurs. debugging always showed a value for old_name when replace is called on it. am i missing something js-esque?..this is the part of the code that causes the error, specifically line 31:....  if (w > mobile_threshold) {.    responsive_elements = document.getelementsbyclassname(""desktop"");.    if (responsive_elements.length > 0) {.      for (i in responsive_elements) {.        var old_name = responsive_elements[i].classname;.        var new_name = old_name.replace(""desktop"", ""mobile"");.        responsive_elements[i].classname = new_name;.      }.    }....when necessary i will be happy to provide more code, or whatever information is needed. thanks!"
