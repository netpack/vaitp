"what occurs when requestanimationframe(callback); changes width of an image? repaint or reflow? i have read some topics about reflow and repait this is what i maneged to understand....  a repaint occurs when changes are made to an elements skin that.  changes visibility, but do not affect its layout..  .  a reflow occurs when changes are made to the elements layout....anyway, when...  window.requestanimationframe(callback);...updates selected image element changing it's width what occurs repaint or reflow..in mdn the callback parameter was discriebed as:...  a parameter specifying a function to call when it's time to update your animation for the next repaint....so what occurs after all, reflow or repaint?..here is an example of my problem:....var jediimg = document.getelementbyid('jedi-image');.jediimg.src = 'images/jedi-image.jpg';.jediimg.width = 400;..var times = 20,.  update = -1;..var isjedivisible = true;..function animationframe() {.  if (isjedivisible) {.    jediimg.width = 0;.  } else {.    jediimg.width = 400;.  }.  isjedivisible = !isjedivisible;..  jediimg.width = (20 - times) * 50;.  times += update;.  if (times === 0) {.    update = 1;.  }.  if (times == 20) {.    update = -1;.  }.  requestanimationframe(animationframe);.}.animationframe();.....thank you for your answers."
