"how to reset field if i click a button? i have 3 radio button; approve, reject and interview..if i click reject, it is mandatory to choose from a dropdown menu why it is rejected. by default, the dropdown menu will appear 'please select' on the field..if i click approve or interview, the dropdown menu will be disable..now it is working fine..however, the problem is if i click reject then i choose one of the item in the dropdown menu, let say 'documents not completed', after that if i click approve or interview, the field still show 'documents not completed'..what i want to do is if i choose reject, then i choose the reason from the dropdown menu, then i want to change to approve or interview, i want the dropdown menu field automatically reset and back to 'please selec'...can you guys help me?"
