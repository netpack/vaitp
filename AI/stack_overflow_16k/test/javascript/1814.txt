"blank to track if a click opened a new tab/window in my application when a user is clicking any ""a href"" link then a ""loading"" dialog appears (this is necessary for many reasons beyond the scope of this question). some users, however, open some links in new tabs/windows, thus the ""loading"" dialog should not be shown in the opener window. is that possible to track somehow with js?"
