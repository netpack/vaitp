"mark blank as safe i am attempting to run a blank that installs a utility on a client's system via web browser.  i appear to have put something together that does the trick but in doing so i need to change ie's browser's settings to enable ""initilize and script activex controls not marked safe for scripting"". this obviously cannot work in the real world. if this setting is not enabled all that is displayed on the web browser is a discreet ""error on page"" on the bottom of the web browser. i would ultimately like to have the script marked as safe so the clients would be prompted to run the activex control.  so my question is how do i mark a blank as safe. i also like to point out that our web pages are created using .net's razor's engine (mvc3) so a compatible solution would be greatly appreciated.  ..cshtml snippet..script language=blank..function launchexecutable(executablefullpath)..{.. var shellactivexobject = new activexobject(""wscript.shell"");.. shellactivexobject.run(executablefullpath, 1, false);.. shellactivexobject = null;..}..script....."
