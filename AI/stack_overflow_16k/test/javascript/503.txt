"how to get parallel behavior in java script? more or less i want to execute two functions in parallel..one way as i see is doing through settimeout function. ..i have not completely gone through the reactiveexentension, although it looks promising but may be overkill for my needs. ..is there any framework which supports parallelism ?..my use case is trivial, but i would like to know if anybody heavily needed parallelism in java script ?..thanks, biswanath."
