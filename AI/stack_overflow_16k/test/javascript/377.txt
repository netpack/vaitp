"writing to an object within a loop i'd like to create an object with the following function's output.....var threads = {. ""thread1"": {.  ""upvotes"": {.   ""8fsygfs"": true,.   ""atw9g87"": true,.   ""atw923swg87"": true,.   ""34j2njk"": true.  },.  ""downvotes"": {.   ""jne280n"": true,.   ""892ned9"": true,.   ""28hd0ye"": true,.   ""cjsnd09"": true,.   ""02jd0d2"": true,.  }. },. ""thread2"": {.  ""upvotes"": {.   ""02jd0d2"": true,.   ""8fsygfs"": true,.   ""7dr4229"": true,.   ""232c3f25"": true,.   ""34j2njk"": true,.   ""atw9g87"": true,.   ""atw923swg87"": true,.  },.  ""downvotes"": {.   ""jne280n"": true,.   ""9ah8229"": true,.   ""89h208d"": true,.   ""28hd0ye"": true,.   ""cjsnd09"": true.  }. },. ""thread3"": {.  ""upvotes"": {.   ""02jd0d2"": true,.   ""9ah8229"": true,.   ""838w32l"": true,.   ""78awg2l"": true,.   ""34j2njk"": true.  },.  ""downvotes"": {.   ""jne280n"": true,.   ""atw9g87"": true,.   ""892ned9"": true,.   ""28hd0ye"": true.  }. }.}..var members = [. ""8fsygfs"",. ""atw9g87"",. ""atw923swg87"",. ""34j2njk"",. ""jne280n"",. ""892ned9"",. ""28hd0ye"",. ""cjsnd09"",. ""02jd0d2"",. ""9ah8229"",. ""9ah8229"",. ""7dr4229"",. ""232c3f25"",. ""838w32l"",. ""78awg2l"".]..function getalignmentsets() {.    var checked = [].    members.foreach(k =&gt; {.     members.foreach(l =&gt; {.      var matches = 0.      if (k != l &amp;&amp; (!checked.includes(l))) {.       object.keys(threads).foreach(m =&gt; {.        var thread = object.keys(threads[m].upvotes).concat(object.keys(threads[m].downvotes)).        if (thread.includes(k) &amp;&amp; thread.includes(l)) {.         matches++.        }.       }).       console.log(k + "": { "" + l + "": "" +  matches + "" }"" ).      }.     }).     checked.push(k).    }).}..getalignmentsets().....this function counts the total number of times two users voted on the same thread--regardless of whether they voted the same or differently. i need it to output an object that looks like this:..""member1"": {.    ""member2"": 2, // value is the number of times the this member has.    ""member3"": 1, // voted on the same thread as its parent.    ....},.""member2"": {.    ""member3"": 2,.    ....},.......i'm struggling with the concept of property bracket accessors in writing to an object within a loop, especially when writing children. thanks in advance for your help."
