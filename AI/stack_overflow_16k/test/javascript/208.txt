"when and how do we need to use 'undefined' as a value? ..const data = {.  id: 1.};..console.log('name:', data.name);..data.name = undefined; // set as undefined..console.log('name:', data.name);..console.log('data:', data);.console.log('keys:', object.keys(data));.....on the above snippet, in data object, there's name key after data.name = undefined;...is name undefined actually? when do we need to use this undefined as a value?..e.g: i heard that we can use this undefined value when delete a item in array. and it will better in performance than array.prototype.splice()."
