"function to add up all the numbers from 1 to num i think there could be a better version then my solution. my solution is working just fine. i didn't like juggling of all values using for loop. ..but i am particularly wondering, if there is nice and one line solution getting all values in array up to entered number from function. ..function simpleadding(num) {.  var fnum = [];.  for (var i = 1; i &lt;= num; i++) {.    fnum.push(i);.  }.  return fnum.reduce(function(prevvalue, currentvalue) {.    return prevvalue + currentvalue;.  }).}"
