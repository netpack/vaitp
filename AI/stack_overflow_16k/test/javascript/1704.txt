"blank learning, while if this may seem stupid to some, but please try and help me see sense here, i'm currently learning blank and one of my challenges is as follows...  in countdown.js below, modify the while-loop with a conditional that will only allow a number to be printed if it is even. your results should be the even numbers from 10 to 2 descending. think carefully about how your code might decide if a number is evenâ€¦...if i use the code below i get the answer 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, but if i change it to num + 1 in the log out it works. i thought the decrement would occur after the log out put? ..var num = 10;..while (num &gt; 0) {.    if (num % 2) {.        console.log(num); // can't be right??????.    }.    num--;.}"
