"can you fake out array.isarray() with a user-defined object? i'm curious about whether there is any way to fake out array.isarray() with a user-defined object...from the book blank patterns:..array.isarray([]); // true..// trying to fool the check.// with an array-like object.array.isarray({.  length: 1,.  ""0"": 1,.  slice: function () {}.}); // false...that object clearly fails, but is there any other way to do it? this is sheer curiosity, and not because i think that you could ever screw with .isarray() in regular client code (though it would obviously be fantastic to know if you could!)."
