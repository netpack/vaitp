"calculate holidays in blank i created the following blank to calculate holidays that are not fixed.  it works it seems.  my questions, though, are can it be written more efficiently and did i omit anything that would improve it?..var year = new date().getfullyear();..//  lowercase is used.var first = 1,second = 2,third = 3,fourth = 4;  // which occurrence in a given month.  if there ma be a fifth occurrence, use ""last."".var last = 99;  //  find last occurrence of weekday in a month.
