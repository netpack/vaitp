"blank anonymous closure - return vs window i'm learning about anonymous closures and the module pattern. i understand that using a return object will expose some functionality of the module. however there have been some mentions of attaching some functionality to the window/global object...i was wondering if attaching to the window was a more hacky way of doing a proper return, or had a legitimate use?..var speakingdog = (function() {.    var dog = 'spot';.    var says = 'woof';.    function speak() {.      return (dog + ' goes ' + says);.    }.    return {.        speak: speak.    }.})();...vs..(function() {.    var dog = 'spot';.    var says = 'woof';.    function speak() {.      return (dog + ' goes ' + says);.    }.    window.speak = speak;.})();"
