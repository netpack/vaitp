"generating random numbers in an array without repeating previous value on its first index? i need to generate a random number from the given set of an array without repeating the previous value that is in the index[0] of that array?..for eg:..if i have an array like this: let array = [6.01,6.02,6.03,6.04,6.05]..i am shuffling the array using this function:..   for (.     var j, x, i = o.length;.     i;.     j = parseint(math.random() * i), x = o[--i], o[i] = o[j], o[j] = x.      );.   return o;. }..var random = shuffle(numbers);..console.log(randome[0])...i am getting different values. but sometimes the value is repeating again...eg: in console:..random[0] =&gt; 6.01...again if i run it..random[0] =&gt; 6.01...if previous value is 6.01 it shouldnt be again 6.01 it needs to be different value from that array...is any possible way to achieve this?..thanks in advance"
