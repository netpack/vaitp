"can blank be used for two buttons at once? i've recently been learning / working with blank, and can get it to work ok. however, i don't seem to be able to get it to play 2 buttons hit at the same time...for example, .[button1] [button2]..where each has a different sound programmed to it. you can hit each one and get a sound, but when you hit both, you don't get any sound...is there a way to get both to play their sounds when you hit them both?..thanks.......my code if relevant:..  &lt;button id=""eb3btn""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;.  &lt;button id=""fbtn""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;..  &lt;script src=""&lt;?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?&gt;/blank/howler.js/howler.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.  &lt;script&gt;.      var eb3 = new howl({urls: [""&lt;?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?&gt;/sounds/eb3.mp3""]}).      document.getelementbyid('eb3btn').onclick=function(){eb3.play()};..      var f3 = new howl({urls: [""&lt;?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?&gt;/sounds/f3.mp3""]}).      document.getelementbyid('fbtn').onclick=function(){f3.play()};.  &lt;/script&gt;"
