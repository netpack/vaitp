"blank special characters/regular expressions i'm trying to learn from reading mozilla documentation for regular expressions, but there's one thing i don't get. for the special character s it gives the following example../sw*/ matches ' bar' in ""foo bar.""..i understand that s is the special character for white space, but why is there a w* in the example?..doesn't /s/ also match ' bar' in ""foo bar.""?..what's with the w*?"
