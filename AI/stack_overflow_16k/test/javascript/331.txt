"nested loop (2 levels) blank timeout there were questions with looping in blank and i followed them to create my loop. but my issue is that i want a double loop. i am having an html with a div-container that has an image...&lt;div id=""mydiv""&gt;.&lt;img alt=""client logo"" src=""1/1-1.png"" /&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;...images are stored in folders 1 to 7 (their names). hence, source of images looks like this 1/1-1.png, 3/3-264.png, 4/4-489.png etc. files in every folder before the dash sign have the number of the folder as well. the goal: i want to show all the pictures with a timeout starting with 1/1-1.png, then 1/1-2.png, 1/1-3.png...2/1-1.png,2/1-2.png etc. one after another till 7/7-608.png. i.e. there are 608 images in every folder. i am doing this:..for (var f=1; f&lt;=7;f++) {.for (var s=1; s&lt;=608; s++) {.dosettimeout(s,m);.} }.function dosettimeout(i,f) {.var timer = i+(f-1)*608;.settimeout(function(){$('#mydiv img').attr('src',f+'/'+f+'-'+i+'.png')},500*timer);.}...but it doesn't work. it used to work fine without the outer loop of f. so, obviously, i am doing something wrong. maybe, because the variables are global, but i don't quite get what it means in this context. would really appreciate your help."
