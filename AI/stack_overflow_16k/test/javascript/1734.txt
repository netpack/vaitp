push objects in to filtered blank array given this example how can i push each result found by the filter into the obj rather than reset it once for each item found by the filter?..the filter grabs the first result from the filter and sets obj[0] to that value. suppose i have 10 results from the filter how do i append the values to obj rather than set it to a single value.  i thought i would need to use push...var obj = array.filter(function ( obj ) {.    return obj.name === name;.})[0];
