"move selection to next word using blank i have some html text i.e. ..this is line1...i can get the initial user selection using window.getselection() assume it is 'this'. on a click of a button, i like the user selection to move to the next word i.e. 'is'. how can i do this? i currently have the following code which does not work:..function myfunction().{.var selection=window.getselection();.selection.collapse(selection.focusnode, 0);.selection.modify(""move"",""forward"",""word"");.selection.extend(selection.focusnode, selection.focusoffset);.}...and this is't good for me, because even the earlier word stays selected..var selection = window.getselection();.selection.modify(""extend"", ""forward"", ""word"");"
