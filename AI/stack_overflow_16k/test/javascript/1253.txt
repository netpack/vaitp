"how do i break a loop externally in blank? let's say this function is running: ..var runningfunction = ""none"",.    foo             = 1000,.    counter         = 0;..function somefunc() {..    runningfunction = ""somefunc"";..    from(var i = 0; i &lt; foo; i++) {..        counter++;..    }..}...and i wanted to break that, say upon a window.resize detection..$(window).resize(function() {..    // break somefunc function.    // say scenario broke at count = 595..}...how can i do that? i can write to some variable which function is running, as shown above."
