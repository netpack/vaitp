"textfield blocked when option ""sin asignar"" is selected morning...ive got a problem in js , and i dont know how to solve it. as you can see in the image below, my textfield is blocked when i press the option ""sin asignar "" in other combobox. i show you the code:..if($(""#presupuestoproyectonew"").val() == 0){.                $(""#clientesproyectonew"").multiselect(""enable"");.                $(""#tarifasproyectonew"").multiselect(""enable"");.                $(""#clientesproyectonew"").multiselect(""refresh"");.                $(""#tarifasproyectonew"").multiselect(""refresh"");.            }   ...well, as you can see in the code , when the other combobox his value is 0. the others combobox are blocked. this part is doing his work fine. however, i cant understand why the textfield is blocked, i cant write anything. why its happening this? anyone can help? thanks"
