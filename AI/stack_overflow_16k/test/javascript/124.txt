"sessionstorage with document.domain according to the spec, i should be able to set the document.domain to my root domain and thus have subdomains share sessionstorage.  but i can't seem to get that to work.  is that no longer allowed?  https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#relaxing-the-same-origin-restriction..// set the document domain to the top level.let hostparts = location.hostname.split('.').reverse();.if (hostparts.length &gt; 1).    document.domain = `${hostparts[1]}.${hostparts[0]}`;..this.sessionid = window.sessionstorage.getitem('hplrsn');.if (!this.sessionid) this.sessionid = generateid();...the above code will generate a new id for both site1.dn.domain.com and site2.dn.domain.com"
