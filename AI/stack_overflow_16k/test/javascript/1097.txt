"changing a value inputted in a form from a string to an integer blank i'm very much a beginner to blank and am trying to complete a simple bill splitting exercise. into a html form you input the price of a meal, how many people are paying, and how much of a tip you want to leave, and then it is supposed to give the price that each person should pay. when i put in values of say price: 100, tip:0, number of people: 2, i expect it to give a value of 50, but it gives 500. i believe this is because it is recognizing the inputs as strings as opposed to integers. ..i have attempted converting the strings using number(), and parseint(), but neither of these seem to have worked, instead giving errors that the values are then unidentified...  const price = document.queryselector(""#price"");.  const numpeople = document.queryselector(""#number-people"");.  const tip = document.queryselector(""#tip"");.  const errormsg = document.queryselector(""#error-msg"");.  const resultdisplay = document.queryselector(""#result"");..  form.addeventlistener(""submit"", onsubmit);..function onsubmit(e) {.  e.preventdefault();.  console.log(""button clicked""); // confirm button pressed.  if(price.value === """" || numpeople.value === """" || tip.value === """") { // simple validation.      errormsg.innerhtml = ""enter all fields""; // enter html into error-msg div .      conole.log(""not all fiels were entered""); // send error to log.  } else {.      console.log(""success""); // send confirmation to log.      console.log(`price is ${price.value}, number of people is ${numpeople.value} and tip is ${tip.value}`); // send values entered to log.      const result = (price.value + tip.value) / numpeople.value; // complete calculation.      console.log(result); // send the result to the log.  }.}  ...i expect the output of (100 + 0) / 2 to be 50, but it is 500...when using parseint() and number() i did:..const result = (parseint(price.value) + parseint(tip.value)) / parseint(numpeople.value);..and number() respectively...sorry if this is a simple question, any help would would be appreciated."
