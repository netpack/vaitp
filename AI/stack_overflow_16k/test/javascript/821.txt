"what is the difference in these 2 window.location.href redirection? (chrome) i am trying to do a simple page redirection using window.location.href = ... in chrome...for example, the desired url is http://[hostname]:[port]/error/timeout..at first i try use..window.location.href = window.location.host + ""/error/timeout""..though i logged the url generated is correct, it does not work, the page does not redirect at all...then i changed to ..window.location.href = ""/error/timeout""..it works! but the url generated is exactly the same as previous method.....so my question is what makes such difference ?"
