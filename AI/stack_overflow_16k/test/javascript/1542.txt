"blank: are objects returned by reference or is a new instance instantiated? suppose we have the following js function that handles date objects:..targetdate and referencedate are intended to be date objects...function validatedate(targetdate, referencedate) {.  if (targetdate &lt; referencedate) return referencedate;.  else return targetdate;.}...now suppose we want the returned object to be a new instance and not a pointer to the same memory address as the input parameters. ..in order to do this, do we need to replace the return dateobjectinstance with return new date(dateobjectinstance), or does return already instantiate a new object? ..in other words: are objects returned by reference or is a new instance instantiated?"
