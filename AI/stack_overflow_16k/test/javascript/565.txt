"is there a way to improve this use of reduce? this is a common pattern i am using in my application.....const data = [{.    id: 1234,.    name: 'item1',.    condition: true.  },.  {.    id: 1235,.    name: 'item2',.    condition: false.  },.  {.    id: 1236,.    name: 'item3',.    condition: true.  }.]..//filters into array of ids of objects that meet condition.const onlyids = data.reduce((idarr, item) =&gt; {.  item.condition &amp;&amp; idarr.push(item.id).  return idarr;.}, [])..console.log(onlyids);.....i am curious if there are optimizations i could be aware of? ..some optimizations iâ€™m curious about are, fallibility,  readability, performance, and, eloquence.  are there other optimizations i should be considering in general?"
