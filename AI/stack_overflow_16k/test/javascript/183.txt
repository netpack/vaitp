"destructuring for get the first property of an object? for arrays, we can define the properties depending on it's indexes like:....const arr = [1, 2, 3];.const [first, second, third] = arr;.console.log(first, second, third).....i'm just wondering if there's a possible solution to do it's reverse with objects like:....const obj = {first: ""a"", second: ""b"", third: ""c""}.    const {0, 1, 2} = obj; .//expected: ""a"", ""b"", ""c"""
