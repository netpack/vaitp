"double exclamation points? .  possible duplicate:.  what is the !! (not not) operator in blank?.  what does the !! operator (double exclamation point) mean in blank?  .....so i was debuging some code and ran across this:..var foo.bar = 0; // this is actually passed from another function, adding it for context..function(foo) {.    var somevar = !!foo.bar;..    if (foo.bar) {.      // ..stuff happens.    } else {.      // .. something else happens.    }.}...okay my questions is what is the point of !!? all that is doing is making the 0 === false. ...is there any benefit to using that compared to boolean(foo.bar)?.foo.bar can be evaluated in an if as is because 0 === false already, so why go through the conversion? (somevar is not reused anywhere else)"
