"how to create function x times i'm learning to code and i've come across a probably quite easy problem to solve...i make a request from the database, that returns a number of users. for each user i create a few input fields like name, email etc...now what i want to do is use the same php variable (that contains the number of users), to create or repeat a function x times...this is what i've tried so far...var j = 0;..while (j &lt;= i) { //i is the variable passed from php, containing the number of useres..    j++;..    $('#btnedit'+j).click(function() {..        $(""#prename""+j).removeattr('disabled');.        $(""#surname""+j).removeattr('disabled');.        $(""#function""+j).removeattr('disabled');.        $(""#prefix""+j).removeattr('disabled');.        $(""#phone_number""+j).removeattr('disabled');.        $(""#email""+j).removeattr('disabled');...    });...}...the html looks something like this:..input..&lt;label&gt;prename&lt;/label&gt;.&lt;input name=""prename"" id=""prename&lt;?php echo $i; ?&gt;"" value=""&lt;?php echo $row['db_prename_value']; ?&gt;"" maxlength=""100"" type=""text"" placeholder=""prename"" disabled=""disabled"" /&gt;...button..&lt;input type=""button"" id=""btnedit&lt;?php echo $i; ?&gt;"".name=""button&lt;?php echo $i; ?&gt;"" value=""edit""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;...to give a short explanation:..if the database returns 2 users, all the above fields are created for 2 users in php. user 1 will have prename1, surname1 etc. while user 2 will have prename2, surname2 and so on...i won't know how many users get returned by the database so i can't just manually create the above snippet a set amount of times...to clarify, i've already passed the variable from php to blank (variable i). the question is how to repeat the blank function x times, as the snippet i've posted is not working...as far as my understanding goes, what my code does is iterate through the while loop x amount of times, but stops at this line, since the button is not being clicked...    $('#btnedit'+j).click(function() {...maybe i'm just confused about how to do what i'm trying to do. ..let's make an example. if the variable i is 2, i want the loop to create 2 functions, the first function has to be executed when the button with the id btnedit1 is being clicked, the second function needs to execute when a button with the id btnedit2 is being clicked etc...thanks"
