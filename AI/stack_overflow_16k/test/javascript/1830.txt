"remove thing from my array if they don't have a prefix this is my first question here, so please be nice :)..i have an array with different names in it. this looks like that: [""student:monica"", ""student:rebecca"", ""student:james"", ""teacher:mr. anders""]..in reality there are more names in there. from this, i want to make a list with only the students and it shouldn't say student: in front of it...so i tried to do it like that:..var students_and_teachers = [""student:monica"", ""student:rebecca"", ""student:james"", ""teacher:mr. anders""];..for (i = 0; i &lt; students_and_teachers.length; i++) {.  var a_student_or_teacher = students_and_teachers[i];.  if (a_student_or_teacher.startswith(""student:"") === true) {.    students_and_teachers[i] = a_student_or_teacher.substring(8, 100);.  } else {.    delete students_and_teachers[i];.  }.}...and this works good but now when i show the students and teachers afterwards it looks like that: array [ ""monica"", ""rebecca"", ""james"", ,  ] . but it should only have the three students and not the empty things in the end...am i doing something wrong?"
