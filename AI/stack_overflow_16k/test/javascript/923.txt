"break string into array with combination of every x words i have a long blank string. i am trying to break it into an array with every x combination of consecutive words. so for example if my array..var string = 'this is my example string'..and my x was equal to 3 i would get something like:..['this', 'this is', 'this is my', 'is', 'is my', 'is my example', 'my', 'my example', 'my example string', 'example string', 'string']..so like, every combination of up to three words. i am using this as an index to do fuzzy text matching on."
