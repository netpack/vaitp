is it possible to save all field information when the user closes his browser? e.g. someone is writing an article but accidently closes the browser. is it possible to save everything he wrote?..something like this: ..onexit -> get all the information the user filled -> ajax request that saves the information in a database...or ..is it only possible by preemptively saving every x second?
