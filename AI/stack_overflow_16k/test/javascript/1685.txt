"how to open multiple tabs on my browser based on the input set of values using blank , code added problem:in my workplace sometimes i have to open multiple tickets that i have to open in order to do data analysis. .i have the ticket numbers handy with me. and the hyperlink to open the ticket only differs in the ticket number..how can i automate it , i have do huge analysis for about 4000 tickets, so i really need to automate this stuff. ..hyerplink is of the format ..https://oldwebe.company.com/xyz/ticketnumber.jspx?tnumber=7-12345...where 12345 is the ticket number...so say i have below ticket numbers:.12333.12432.12123..which means that in  above requirement i should be able to open below hyperlinks each in a separate tab...https://oldwebe.company.com/xyz/ticketnumber.jspx?tnumber=7-12333.https://oldwebe.company.com/xyz/ticketnumber.jspx?tnumber=7-12432.https://oldwebe.company.com/xyz/ticketnumber.jspx?tnumber=7-12123...i have to open below links automatically based on the input ticket numbers that i give. so  that input number of tickets  can change , sometimes i should be able to open 10 tickets, sometimes 20 , sometimes 50 and so on...note:..1.i dont want to use python because when i try to open the firefox browser from it , i am being asked to reauthenticate again..so that defeats the purpose of this automation..also note that i havent yet written any logic to do that in python either....i am a complete newbie in blank and do not have a code to share and say i could write upto this etc. so would really appreciate of community members..i prefer to use blank because i am using one small script (in a bookmark) provided by company forum to open web portal based on only 1 input ticket. but if you think it easily doable in any other language which can be input in a bookmark, for which i can give a shortcut key, i am open to that as well....below is the slightly redacted version of the script i mentioned i am using currently, :..    (.    function()%20.    {.        var%20fvalue=prompt(""search%20ticket"",""ticket"");%20if(fvalue!=null){%20if%20((fvalue.indexof('-')==1)%20&amp;&amp;%20(fvalue.lastindexof('-')==1)%20&amp;&amp;%20(!isnan(fvalue.replace('-'%20,%200)))).            %20{self.window.open('https://oldwebe.company.com/xyz/ticketnumber.jspx?tnumber='+fvalue).focus()}.        %20else%20if%20.        ((fvalue.indexof('-')==1)%20&amp;&amp;%20(fvalue.lastindexof('-')==1)%20&amp;&amp;%20(fvalue.lastindexof('%20')==-1)%20&amp;&amp;%20 (isnan(fvalue.replace('-'%20,%200)))).        %20{a}.        %20else%20if((fvalue.charat((fvalue.length)-2)%20==%20'.')%20&amp;&amp;.    (!isnan(fvalue)))%20{b}%20else%20if((fvalue.indexof('.')==-1%20)%20&amp;&amp;.    (!isnan(fvalue)))%20{c}%20}.    }.    )();"
