"returning a self executing function (iife) from another function (function($) {..    var foo = (function(){..        //some functions..    })();..    // i can access foo here.    var f = new foo();..})(jquery);..// but obviously not here since it's in another scope...how do i return foo to the window scope, so that it can be accessed outside of the outer iife? i've tried return foo; but it did not work."
