"blank - how to detect number as a decimal (including 1.0) it feels like i am missing something obvious here.  this has been asked a number of times - and the answer usually boils down to:..var num = 4.5;.num % 1 === 0; // false - 4.5 is a decimal...but, this fails for ..var num = 1.0; // or 2.0, 3.0, ....num % 1 // 0...unfortunately, these doesn't work either..num.tostring() // 1.typeof num // ""number""...i am writing a blank color parsing library, and i want to process input differently if it is given as 1.0 or 1.  in my case, 1.0 really means 100% and 1 means 1...otherwise, both rgb 1 1 1 and rgb 1 255 255 will be parsed as rgb 255 255 255 (since i am right now taking anything &lt;= 1 to mean a ratio)."
