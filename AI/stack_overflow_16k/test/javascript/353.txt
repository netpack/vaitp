"convert weird characters into readable text using this function..function decode (data) {.  return (new buffer('' + data, 'base64')).tostring().}...this line in blank is supposed to return some human readable text like so ..var text = decode(fs.readfile(path.join(inbox.dir, inbox.messages[found].hash), 'utf8'))...but instead returns this characters when i log text in the console..�w^~)�...i also tried to console log without the decode but it returns undefined, hope someone can help me with the a proper deconversion script"
