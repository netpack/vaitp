ignore case when searching an array in blank i'm just trying to ignore case when doing a search what's the best way to do it? (no jquery please)..function search(searchvalue) {.    var found = [];.    for (var i = 0; i &lt; photodata.length; i++) {.        if (photodata[i].description.search(searchvalue) != -1) {.            found.push(photodata[i]);.        }.}.console.log(found);.return found;.}...i tried doing search(searchvalue.ignorecase) but it returns duplicates of any that have an uppercase letter. so any suggestions? i want to ignore the case of photodata's description
