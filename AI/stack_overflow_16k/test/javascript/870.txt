"is it possible to have these functions exposed for testing? given that i'm extending an existing module and it uses the module.exports in the way shown below, can i even call the start methods from (mocha) tests?..i suspect that there's no decent way to tap into it - and that's ok. i'd just rather test these if i am able to and would love to know how to do it if possible...const nodehelper = require(""node_helper"");.module.exports = nodehelper.create({.    start: function() {.        //do stuff.    };.});...edit: nodehelper returns a function that appears to be ""extended"":..nodehelper.create = function(moduledefinition) {.    return nodehelper.extend(moduledefinition);.};"
