"how to implement my own blank code (ad tag code) to get ads from my ad server just like buysellads i have been looking for information about how i can implement my own blank code (invocation code/ ad tag code) that will get image ads from my ad server to the publishers website, just like buysellads.com or other ad websites...what i am puzzled about is how they get the ads from the database in the ad server and on to the publishers website...when i look at some of their codes, i don't see anything about referencing a page which in turn makes calls to the database to get the specified ads...please i need help in this regard. pseudo code or plain explanation would be highly appreciated...thanks"
