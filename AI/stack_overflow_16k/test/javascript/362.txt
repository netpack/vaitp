"looping via array without using property i have a data which goes something like this..var data =  [{""empid"":1},{""empid"":2},{""empid"":3},{""empid"":4},{""empid"":5},{""empid"":6},{""empid"":7},{""empid"":8},{""empid"":9}]...when i try to iterate over it using blank, the value which is returned is another object. ..i am trying to do something like this..for (var key in data) {.    console.log(' name=' + key + ' value=' + data[key]);..}...i expected to see my empid values as part of 'value' in the log but the 'value' is another object array...fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/sourabhtewari/b6b3qxo7/..note: i cannot use property name to fetch the value as the data would be dynamic. so i cant do something like json.stringify(data[key].empid)"
