"why are static private variables in blank static? i am reading nicholas c. zakas's blank for web developers third edition (old, i know), and i am having trouble understanding why static private variables/functions are static in the first place. i understand that if i declared a constructor with private variables/functions, all of its instances would have their own private variables/functions, like in one of zakas's examples:..function myobject(){..    //private variables and functions .    var privatevariable = 10;..    function privatefunction(){ .        return false;.    }..    //privileged methods .    this.publicmethod = function (){.        privatevariable++;.        return privatefunction(); .    };.}...so how would putting private variables/functions in private scopes make the variables static? is it just because they're enclosed in a private scope, or is there something i'm overlooking? here's one of zakas's examples on static private variables:..(function(){..   //private variables and functions .   var privatevariable = 10;..   function privatefunction(){ .      return false;.   }..   //constructor.   myobject = function(){ .   };..   //public and privileged methods.   myobject.prototype.publicmethod = function(){ .      privatevariable++;.      return privatefunction();.   }; .})();"
