"can a blank closure function act as a callback? i registered a callback function(abc) for a foreach call. the function abc is defined as a closure and it seems it doesn't get called. i would really appreciate to know more about this...code:..function xyz(array).{.  // do something..  function abc(value,index,origin_array){.    // do something.  }..  array.foreach(abc);..  //other stuff.}"
