"generate date of birth from id number for people born after 2000 i am looking for a function to generate/ populate date of birth for id numbers of people born after 2000...this is my code right now, but it doesn't extend to after 2000..   var year = idnumber.substring(0, 2);.   var month = idnumber.substring(2, 4).   var day = idnumber.substring(4, 6).   var dob = '19' + year + '/' + month + '/' + day;...how can i modify this to accommodate > 2000?"
