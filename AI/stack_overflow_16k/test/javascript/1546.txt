"first class functions in blank i am reading an article on sitepoint (https://www.sitepoint.com/blank-closures-demystified/) and there is an example of a first class function:..var foo = function() {. console.log(""hello world!"");.};.var bar = function(arg) {.return arg;.};.bar(foo)();...the syntax of the last line looks puzzling to me, and i would have written it as:..bar(foo());...does anyone know if either syntax is ok, or if there is a good reason for writing it the way the article wrote it? if so, please explain what that reason is...thanks,..william"
