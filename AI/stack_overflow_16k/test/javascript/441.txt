"issue with scope of variables in blank .  possible duplicate:.  blank closure inside loops - simple practical example  .....i seem to be struggling to understand the scope of variables in blank...i have the following code:..for (var i =2; i&lt; 5;i++){.    var k = (i+1).tostring().    window['graph.point'+i].onmove = function(x,y){.        return [min(x,window['graph.point'+k].coord[0]],f(min(x,window['graph.point'+k].coord[0]))]}.    }.}...this code is supposed to put some constraints on the possible locations of some movable points i have on a graph.  the problem seems to be that when the graph.point objects check to see if the constrain is satisfied, they use the last value of k, which is 6.  how do i make sure these objects use the value of k that they are supposed to?"
