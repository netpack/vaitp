"what values will return 0 in this function? the following function uses a short circuit operator to return 0 as default:..function custnumparse(str){.    return str*1||0;.}...i am not sure when this will return the second (i mean, i know that it will when str*1 can't be evaluated to true), but i am not sure what inputs could produce that output when multiplying by 1...i know that the falsish values are 0, """", false, null, undefined, nan, but this doesn't help me that much...in other words i am clueless what would happen when i use that function with objects or booleans, etc. i know i can test them all, but i am sure there is an easier way to go..any ideas on what is the most proper way to find these guys without testing them all?"
