"setting object prototype (in example) i`m trying to understand example from ""java script - understanding weird parts"" course. it is explained, that when the greeter.init.prototype is set to greeter.prototype it is done for cleaner code purpose, so we can set the methods in greeter.prototype. but when try the code without that setting -  to store my methods directly in greeter.init.prototype i got an error in the console: ..uncaught typeerror: cannot set property 'prototype' of undefined ..why is that?...the example working part:....  (function(global,$){..var greeter = function (firstname){.    return new greeter.init (firstname); .}..greeter.prototype = {};..greeter.init = function (firstname){..    var self = this;.    self.firstname = firstname.}..greeter.init.prototype = greeter.prototype;..  .  })(window, jquery);....changed part with error (line7&amp;15):....  (function(global,$){..var greeter = function (firstname){.    return new greeter.init (firstname); .}..greeter.init.prototype = {};..greeter.init = function (firstname){..    var self = this;.    self.firstname = firstname.}..  .  })(window, jquery);"
