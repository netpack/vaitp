"is there anyway i could put this blank code in head tag? i have few div's in my form which needs to be hidden at first i.e onload. the problem is when i put that into &lt;head&gt; tag it will try and execute first giving out the error that div has value null, and when i include it below the form it works perfectly. for example..this code works fine given the js code is placed below...&lt;div class=""error"" id=""name_error""&gt;&lt;p&gt;input name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.&lt;input type=""text"" id=""name"" name=""name"" class=""input-text"" value=""enter name...""/&gt;..&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;.     document.getelementbyid('name_error').style.display = 'none';.&lt;/script&gt;...and when i try placing the js code above it doesn't work...is there anyway i could place the blank code in head tag and it should hide the div when the page loads?"
