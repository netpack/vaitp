"changing the class of an html element using blank is unstable i used this code to change the class of an html-element when an onclick-event occurs. the change occurs(i.e. the text color changes) but the change is not stable, it goes back to the styling of its previous class, and my blank code doesn't seem to have any effect. ..function submitrequest(){.    var x = document.forms[""signupform""][""name""].value;.    if(x.tostring().length &lt;= 0){.        var y = document.getelementbyid(""nametd"");.        y.classname = 'change';.    }.}    ...what should i do to make this effect permanent?"
