".isprototypeof() and .hasownproperty() method confusion let say i have this code:....// male will inherit all of the human properties.function human(x, y) {.  // following properties will be inherited.  this.name = x;.  this.age = y;.  this.test = ""test 1"";.}.// following properties will also be inherited.human.prototype.citizen = ""usa"";.human.prototype.employer = ""google"";.human.prototype.test = ""test 2"";..function male(x, y) {.  // following properties will be the own properties of male instances.  this.name = x;.  this.age = y;.  this.gender = ""male"";.}..// inheritance - connecting male object with human object.male.prototype = new human(); // no arguments are passed.male.prototype.constructor = male; // correcting constructor property..var albert = new male(""albert"", 25);.....then, i want to do some testing on the code..human.isprototypeof(albert); // i expect it to return true...but it return false, why is that?..and, for the following test..human.hasownproperty(""age""); // /i expect it to return true...but it return false, why is that?..thanks,..edit.my questions are slightly different with the other question since it's also talk about prototype chain."
