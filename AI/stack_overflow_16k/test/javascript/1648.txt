"blank calling function from different window in my code i'm opening a window to do some work (instagram login). ..after the whole process was finished, the opened window contain information i would like to pass to the ""handling"" window through calling a pre-defined function...i know i can do window.opener to access that window, but it feels unsafe being very generic...is there a way that the opening window can send a handler to the opened window which will be called once the process ends?"
