"get variable based on function argument? html:..&lt;button id=""s01"" onclick=""getmusic(this.id)""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;.&lt;button id=""s02"" onclick=""getmusic(this.id)""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;...blank:..var s01 = [""file"", ""song""];.var s02 = [""file"", ""song""];..function getmusic(e){.    alert().}...alright so i have this code above (this is a simplified version). this function will set e in getmusic(e) to either s01 or s02. i need to be able to call the variable that corresponds to that name (within the alert()) but i'm not even sure where to start. any help is appreciated, thanks!..p.s. any chance i can remove the onclick="""" from the html file and replace it with an addeventlistener in the js file and still achieve the same effect? i don't like mixing my scripts like that."
