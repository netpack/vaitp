"modifying blank variable within function i've read up on declaring variables globally and then being able to modify them in functions, but things aren't working out for me...here is my code:..var selectee = ""jk"";.// get state selected.$('select.form-control.bfh-states').change(function () {.    selectee = $('select option:selected').val();.    // works correctly, but i need to access it outside the function.    console.log(selectee); .});..// output jk, should change based on a select box on the form.console.log(selectee);"
