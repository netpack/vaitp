"how to implement momentum zooming i would like to implement zooming like is done on this site (click the menu -> demo) or this site. as you can see you can zoom in and out with momentum...so, my question was, how is that possible. my initial though was something like this..&lt;main&gt;.    &lt;section class=""scrolling""&gt;&lt;/section&gt;..   &lt;section class=""overlay""&gt;.       &lt;button class=""demo""&gt;hello&lt;/button&gt;.   &lt;/section&gt;.....a .scrolling layer with an invisible scrollbar. the overlay positioned fixed on top of the .scolling layer with pointer-events: none...scrolling {.    height: 1000vh;.    position: relative;.}...overlay {.    position: fixed;.    top: 0;.    bottom: 0;.    left: 0;.    right: 0;.    pointer-events: none;. }...and a bit of js..main.addeventlistener('scroll', (e) =&gt; {.    const scale = .... magic magic .....    overlay.style.transform = 'scale(...)';.});...demo..as you can see in the demo if you scroll the overlay has momentum-zoom. .but there is one huge problem with my demo...the button is not clickabe.the button doesn't show a mouse-pointer if you move over it...any suggestions what i can do to fix the above issues ?.and are there libraries that support this feature? for example, i found impetus.js but it doesn't seem to do momentum based on the scrolling gesture."
