"blank, subset array with more than one selecting element how do i use an array to subset another array,.arraytotal is array is the array i need to subset..arraytotal = ['a','a','a','b','b','c','c','c','d','d','d','d','d']...arrayselectors is the array of search terms,..arrayselectors = ['a','d']...the output i'd like to achieve is either,..['a','a','a','d','d','d','d','d']...or..[0,1,2,8,9,10,11,12]...i know this can be done with two loops, but i'd like a more elegant option."
