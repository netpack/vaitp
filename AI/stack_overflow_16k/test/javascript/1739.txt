"what is closure compiler? if you have no idea what i am talking about, check this out: http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home (it's a blank minifier)....on thier site, they state the following:...  the closure compiler compiles blank into compact,.  high-performance code. the compiler removes dead code and rewrites and.  minimizes what's left so that it downloads and runs quickly. it also.  checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common.  blank pitfalls. these checks and optimizations help you write.  apps that are less buggy and easier to maintain....but can someone really explain in detail what this closure compiler does to my code?"
