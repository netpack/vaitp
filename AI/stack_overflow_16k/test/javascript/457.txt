"is there a reset.js similar to a reset.css? reset.css files are used to resolve browser inconsistencies when it comes to styling. ..is there something similar for blank inconsistencies across browsers like a reset.js? ..for example this ""reset.js"" library would define a prototype for the string trim() method as specified in this question since (among other things) ie8 does not support this. ..i know libraries like jquery can be used to overcome these inconsistencies but having something like a reset.js could help when using 3rd party blank libraries that do not use jquery."
