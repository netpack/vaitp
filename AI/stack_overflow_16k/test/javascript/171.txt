"why should we wrap await inside an async function? why should we have an async function in order to use await? why can't we just use await without async? js is async by default too, this just adds to the confusion...update:.i've seen some lads put my question on hold so i'll try to elaborate..i'm just curious as to why this won't work:..some code.let users = await getusers();.some code...why should it be inside an async for it to work, ie..$(async function() {.    some code.    let users = await getusers();.    some code.});"
