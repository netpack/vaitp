"uncaught typeerror: cannot read property '3' of undefined i have a problem in the next code:..  var a = g_table_board.data[6][c];.  var b = g_table_board.data[r+1][c];...r is 5 and c is 3,  g_table_board.data is 7x7 matrix..the first line works well, but the second one produce the error:..uncaught typeerror: cannot read property '3' of undefined...the question, is why r+1 produces this error if r+1 is 6?..any idea?"
