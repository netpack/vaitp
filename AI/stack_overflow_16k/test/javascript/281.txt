"i always wonder about meaning of like [, thisarg] things sometimes i study blank code in mdn, but i don't understand what's the meaning of [, thisarg] things....for example, ..arr.map(callback(currentvalue[, index[, array]])[, thisarg])...in this case, i know about there needs to be have callback function. but what's that in the square brackets? why they need comma in case of there's nothing in front of?"
