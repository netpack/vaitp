"replace a value if null or undefined in blank i have a requirement to apply the ?? c# operator to blank and i don't know how..consider this in c#:..int i?=null;.int j=i ?? 10;//j is now 10...now i have this set up in blank:..var options={.       filters:{.          firstname:'abc'.       } .    };.var filter=options.filters[0]||'';//should get 'abc' here, it doesn't happen.var filter2=options.filters[1]||'';//should get empty string here, because there is only one filter...how do i do it correctly?..thanks...edit: i spotted half of the problem: i can't use the 'indexer' notation to objects (my_object[0]). is there a way to bypass it? (i don't know the names of the filters properties beforehand and don't want to iterate over them)."
