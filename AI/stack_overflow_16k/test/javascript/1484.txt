"create list of current time with timezones in blank how do i create this list in blank:..it goes from -11 to +14.....var now = new date();...gives me this:.tue apr 02 2013 20:48:11 gmt+0200 (central european daylight time)..tue apr 02 2013 20:48:11 gmt+0200  is enough, but with the full dayname it would be better. then i still need to create a list. i can create a select option in blank e.g...var time = document.getelementbyid('time'); .time.options[time.options.length] = new option(value, text); .time.options[time.options.length] = new option(value, text);...so i now parts of it but cannot put the whole thing together."
