"find biggest and smallest array blank i am trying to figure out the best way to compare two arrays...essentially i want to know the biggest and smallest array for further processing.  here is my code for doing so thus far:..merge: function(arrone, arrtwo) {..   if(arrone == null || arrtwo == null) throw new error();..    var bigarr = arrone.length &gt; arrtwo.length ? arrone : arrtwo,.        smallarr = bigarr.length == arrone.length ? arrtwo : arrone;..    console.log(bigarr);.    console.log(smallarr);..}...while this works, i am guessing there has to be an easier and more efficient way of doing this.  any thoughts?"
