"instantiating anonymous class during page load i have encountered the following odd behaviour:..during load:..var a = new function() {};.alert(typeof a);          //outputs function instead of object...executing the exact same code after the page has loaded yields object instead of function, as expected...the following does return object but i would like to avoid it if possible:..function b(){}.var a = new b();.alert(typeof a);         //outputs object...am i missing something here? why doesn't the first example give me an object reference instead of a function? ..tested on:..firefox 24..chrome 28..ie 10..edit:..it turns out that it isn't a browser problem but a bug with brackets' live preview...&lt;!doctype html&gt;.&lt;html&gt;.    &lt;head&gt;.        &lt;script&gt;.            var a = new function() {};.            alert(typeof a); //should output 'object' but outputs 'function' in brackets.        &lt;/script&gt;.    &lt;/head&gt;.    &lt;body&gt;.    &lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;"
