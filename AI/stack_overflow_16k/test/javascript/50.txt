"extra output from blank nested loop while practicing loop in js, i wrote following code....var bool = true;.while(bool) {.  for (var i = 3; i &gt;= 0; i--).  {.    console.log(i);  .    bool = i;.  }.}....the output i expected was:.3.2.1.0.(1 digit per line)..the output i encounter was:.3.2.1.0.0.(1 digit per line)..my question is - how does the code or environment component produce the extra ""0""?..thank you for your time and help...the observed result is produced in chrome (f12 -> console tab).screen shoot from chrome..also, on code academy's practice setting. .and somehow i cannot produce /or observe any result from the ""run code snippet"". ..update:..by switching ..console.log(i);..and ..bool = i;..i got 3 2 1 0 instead. ..this would confirm pointy's answer - no expression, only function call - thanks again!"
