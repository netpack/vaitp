"invoke function on specific element load i want to submit a form when it's loaded, without waiting for page full load (it takes very long)..here's my code, it's not good, i know... but i can't think of anything else...var element = document.getelementsbyname(""redirect"");..while(!element) {.    element = document.getelementsbyname(""redirect"");.};..element[0].form.submit();...is there a better way to detect if this form element is loaded?"
