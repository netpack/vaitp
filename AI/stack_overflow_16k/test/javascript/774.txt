"manipulating occurrences of all letters in a string in blank desired functionality:..var mystring = ""123a4 1b234"";.console.log(mystring.allinstancesofletter().something();.//""123a4 1b234""...is there a way to do this without having to complicate things with an array of all 26 letters etc.?..edit: touppercase() causing confusion, i didn't really think of that interaction, i was just choosing a random function."
