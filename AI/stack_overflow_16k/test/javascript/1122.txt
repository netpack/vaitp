"how should i look at structuring my blank? i'm having a little trouble working out how my blank should be structured, etc...my oop skills in languages such as php, actionscript 3 and so on are what i'm assuming to be on-par, but js is lacking this which has thrown me off quite a bit in my learning...i have a vague understanding of the prototype feature which i used a little in as2 - i believe this is the closest i'll be able to get. at the moment, i'm laying out my code similar to this:..var slideshow = .{.    property: value,..    /**.     * this is a method.     */.    mymethod: function().    {.        // do method things.    }.};..// ------.slideshow.property ++;.slideshow.mymethod();...this all works okay, but it's void my ability to do something like:..var myslideshow1 = new slideshow();.var myslideshow2 = new slideshow();..myslideshow1.property = 10;.myslideshow2.property = 16;....i'm not sure on how to go about creating two different instances of one ""object"" i've created (in this case, slideshow)..i can't find any resources that explain the prototype feature in a way that makes sense....any pointers would be supoib."
