"passing around event object from event handler to some another function is it considered a bad practice to pass around event object from an event handler to some another function. ..for example:..document.getelementbyid('something').addeventlistener('mousedown', function(e) {.    console.log(someanotherfunction(e));.});...i don't know why, but to me this looks like a code smell ?"
