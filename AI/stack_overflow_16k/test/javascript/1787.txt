"trigger event when option element selected (no jquery) this question has been asked many times, but all the answers i've seen use jquery, which i can't use for this project. i am trying to execute code when option element ""other"" has been selected from a list inside a select element. ..using ""change"" as the event doesn't seem to work. ....document.queryselector(""#title"").addeventlistener(""change"", (event) =&gt; {.  if (event.target.textcontent === ""other"") {.    console.log(""other selected"");.  }.});.&lt;select id=""title"" name=""movie_title""&gt;.    &lt;option value=""titanic""&gt;titanic&lt;/option&gt;.    &lt;option value=""avatar""&gt;avatar&lt;/option&gt;.    &lt;option value=""other""&gt;other&lt;/option&gt;.&lt;/select&gt;"
