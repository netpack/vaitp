"what is the least issue prone way to separate the first set of numbers from a string? for context, i have a system that asks a user to give a rating between 1-10. afterwards, i give them the option to leave any additional notes they would like to leave...unfortunately what seems to happen half of the time is that a customer will leave notes along with the initial 1-10 rating. with the interface i am using i have no way of restricting the input to numbers only...the best solution i would be going for is to simply separate the number from the statement into two separate variables or into an array[0-1]...so basically i have..var responsea = (customer input here)...then i would need to remove any additional comments they put into the first response..responsea = responsea.somemagic() //this is where i need help...and continue to deal with the remaining interactions and store them as such..var responseb = responsea[1] + "". "" + (customer input 2 here)...this will take the second portion of the first response that includes notes and combines those notes with the second response which contains the second portion of notes. if it's possible to have some sort of way to detect that there were notes in the first place that would also be good to avoid.."". thank you.""...as opposed to..""thank you.""...because of the concatenation of the first string in situations it is not necessary...edit: after rereading this it still seems confusing if you don't know exactly what is going on. let me show you a real world example:...  q1: please give a rating between 1-10:.  ""10! you were very helpful, thank you!"".  .  q2: if you have any notes you may leave them here:.  ""very helpful.""...this means that when the system that deals with the ratings from question 1 receives additional strings, it won't count it as a number. i want to remove everything after the 10 and add it to q2's response to not lose any of their response, but also not store it in the wrong place."
