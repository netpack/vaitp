"how to remove space from last element in array blank so i am wondering how i can remove the space of last element in array. ..let's say i have a string:....  let str = ""d d, b b, c c, d d "";.  let split = str.split("", "");.  let arr = split.map(str =&gt; str.replace(/s/g, '_'));.  console.log(arr);.....so as you can see i am chaining words inside array, but i have a problem that my last item in array have whitespace at the end which end with ""_"" at the end. how i can remove that space from the last element without removing the space between d d?"
