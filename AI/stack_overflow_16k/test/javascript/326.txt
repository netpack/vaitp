"how to get output from console.log when it is a html file i have just started learning blank and have just made my first program a simple guess a number game.  to give the user feed back about there guesses, i used console.log(). it worked on the website that i used to learn blank (http://www.codecademy.com/learn), but when i put it in notepad, saved it an .htm file, and run it, i get the prompts and confirm, but no visible feed back from the console.log command...how can i get the console.log command to work?..here is the code:    ..&lt;script language=""blank""&gt;.    confirm(""are you ready to play 'i can guess that'? a game where player 2 tries to guess player 1 number?"");..    //find out names.    var player1 = prompt(""player 1 what is your name?"",""your name here"");.    var player2 = prompt(""player 2 what is your name?"",""your name here"");..    //player 1 number.    var place_holder = 0; .    var p1 =place_holder;.    while (p1 &gt; 1000 || p1 == 0) {.        p1 = prompt(player2 + ""look away."" + "" "" + player1 + "" "" + ""what is your number?"", ""your number from 1 to 1,000 here"");..        if (p1 != parseint(p1)) {.            p1 = 0;.            console.log(""error: invalled number!"" + "" "" +player1 + "" "" + ""please choose a number between 1 and 1,000"");.        }.        else if(p1&gt;1000) {.            console.log(""error: invalled number!"" + "" "" +player1 + "" "" + ""please choose a number between 1 and 1,000"");.        }.    };..    //set up used guess list.    var listlow = [];.    var listhigh = [];.    var x = 0;.    var p2 = place_holder;..    //game .    while (x &lt; 11) {.        //list used guesses.        console.log(""your guess so far"");.        console.log(""your to low guesses:""+"" "" + listlow);.        console.log(""your to high gusses:""+"" "" + listhigh);..        //player 2 guess.        var p2 = prompt(""player 2 what is your guess?"");..        //good guess.        var test = p1/p2;.        if (test === 1) {.            console.log(""congrats"" + "" "" + player2 +"" ""+ ""you have guessed""+"" "" + "" "" + player1 +"" ""+ ""number"");.            var x = 30;..        //to low.        }.        else if (test &gt; 1) {.            console.log(player2 +"" ""+ ""sorry your guess is to low"");.            listlow.push(p2);.            x=x+1;..        //to high.        }.        else if (test &lt;1) {.            console.log(player2 +"" ""+ ""sorry your guess is to high"");.            listhigh.push(p2);.            x=x+1;..        //something went wrong.        }.        else {.            console.log(""opps something went wrong"");.        }.    };..    if (x &lt; 20) {.        console.log(""sorry"" + "" "" +player2+ "" ""+ ""you are out of guesses."" +"" "" + player1+ "" "" + ""wins!"");.    }..    console.log(""thanks for playing"").&lt;/script&gt;"
