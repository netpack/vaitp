disabling page back and refresh functionality the scoring software i am working on should submit and store date in a db. however re- submitting an action is not allowed in this sport. so i want to disable the page back functionality to avoid re-submitting the same (or revised) data. any php or blank solution is welcome. i do realize the opinions posted that the page back function should not be disabled principally but in this case it would be very helpful however.
