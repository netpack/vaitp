"understanding the output of this blank code having programmed in c/c++, java i am finding difficulty understanding the output of the following program...http://jsfiddle.net/iamrohitbanga/nubgw/..var foo = function() {}.foo.prototype.out = function() {.    console.log(this.num);.}.var bar = function() {};..var f = new foo();.f.num = 1;.var b = new bar();.b.num = 2;..console.log(this);           // 1.f.out();                     // 2.foo.prototype.out.call(b);   // 3.foo.prototype.out.call(bar); // 4...i see the following output..window.1.2.undefined...i have been coding in blank for a while now and can understanding some of the concepts but not everything is clear to me...i have a rough understanding. .i feel in the global space this points to the window and hence the first line of output is clear..for the second line i think since the function out is being invoked on f the value of this in out is f..for the third one my feeling is that by calling the function with input as b, the value of -this is set to b..for the fourth one bar is a global object which has no member named 'num' in its dictionary...is my understanding correct?.can someone explain the role of 'this' and 'prototype' in the context of this program? i find the syntax of prototype slightly obscure..also in chrome when i press f12 while in gmail window and paste the program in there. the third line of output is undefined and not 2. but in jsfiddle it is two. which seems somewhat creepy. why is it different?"
