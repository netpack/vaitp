"why curly brackets behave differently in blank? as far as i know, blank follows ecma specification and according to that,..var x=[2,3,4] // represents array...and..var y= {""a"":1,""b"":2,""c"":3} // represents object with key/value pair...but i am confused because of below 2 examples:..example 1:..{""a"",""b"",""c""} // is valid with return type --&gt; ""c""...whereas..example 2:..var x={""a"",""b"",""c""} // is invalid...can someone please explain reason of outcomes for last 2 examples ?"
