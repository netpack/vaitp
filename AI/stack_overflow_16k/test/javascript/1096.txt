"how to get domain from email address in blank? i want to get the domain part from an email address, in blank. it's easy to extract the domain from an email like via split: ""joe@example.com"", which is example.com...however, emails also come in forms like ""joe@subdomain1.example.com.uk"", of which the domain is example.com.uk, instead of subdomain1.example.com.uk. the problem here is that subdomain1 can be mistakenly considered as part of the domain...how do i do this reliably?"
