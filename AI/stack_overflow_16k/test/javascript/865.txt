"document.write text over multiple lines i have a script that takes an input string from a user with variable length, typically ~ 400-3000 letters..my script does some modification to the string, and then should print it to the screen..using document write, everything appears on one line. however, i want to have ~ 100 letters for each output line, so the user won't have to scroll ~ 3000 letters to the right to see the whole text...the only way i could imagine to do this would be a for loop, but maybe someone know a better solution?..edit:..this is the for loop i am currently using to achieve this..document.write(""&lt;p&gt;"",""&gt;position: "", (lower+1) + ""-"" + (lower +print_screen.length), ""&lt;br/&gt;"");..// print only 70 chars per line.for(i = 0; i &lt; print_screen.length; i += 69){.    document.write(print_screen.substring(i, i+69), ""&lt;br/&gt;"");.};..document.write(""&lt;/p&gt;"");"
