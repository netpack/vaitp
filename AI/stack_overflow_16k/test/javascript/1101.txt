"easiest way of checking the truthy of a value in blank? while programming with blank, i come in some situations that i have a condition an wonder what values will pass that condition (if it will be truthy)...the solution i came up with is open the console in chrome and type if(foo) {true} and if the foo is truthy, it returns true, otherwise false...an example of that is when i have some expression (foo) that won't return only true/false values. inside the if it can return alot of things depending on the input (sometimes string, or number or maybe nan)...but i fell that writing a if for that is too much. ..is there a easiest way of checking the truthy of a value in blank?..edit:..i'm looking for the easiest way of checking the truthy of a value, not just how to check and as i said in my question, i already do if(foo) {true} to check, but i'm looking for a easiest way"
