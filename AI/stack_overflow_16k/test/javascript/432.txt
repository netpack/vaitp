"execution context and return statement in ecmascript spec said that after function invocation we have a new creation of a specified execution context for an appropriate function. so, consider the following simple function:..function(){.    var a='a';.    return 0;.}...after function invocation we have that a new execution context will be created. but after return statement is executed we have returned to an execution context from which our function is called. but what about function's execution context? is there exist even after we're leaving from this?"
