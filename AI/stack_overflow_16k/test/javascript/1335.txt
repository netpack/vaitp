"understanding ""find longest word in string"" code function findlongestword(str){.    str = str.split("" "");.    var longest = 0;.    var word = null;.    for (i = 0;i &lt; str.length; i++){.        if (longest &lt; str[i].length){.            longest = str[i].length;.            word = str[i];.        }.    }.    console.log(longest);.    return word.length;.}...i don't understand the use of var longest = 0; and var word = null. i only understand the use of ""split"", ""for"", and ""if""...why is the following:...longest = str[i].length is this same as 0 = str[i].length? if yes, why set it to 0?.str[i] = word is this same as null = str[i]? as i know null means ""empty""....what is the logic here?"
