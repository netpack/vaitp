"are there any disadvantages to using backticks (template strings) for regular strings? i like using backticks for strings in blank so that i can avoid the need for escaping quotes...for example, instead of writing:..const s = ""anna's t-shirt says ""hello"""";...or:..const s = 'anna's t-shirt says ""hello""';...i can use template strings to write:..const s = `anna's t-shirt says ""hello""`;.....is there any disadvantage to using template strings in this way?  is there a performance cost or something else negative?"
