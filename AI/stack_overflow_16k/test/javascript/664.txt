"is there a correct way of spacing in blank? in a preliminary technical interview, i was asked to write a simple calculator function in blank.  my code was passable but he commented on my bad spacing. i wrote something like this: .. var calc = function(num1, num2, operand){       //function(...  vs function (....      if(operand === 'add'){                     .           return num1 + num2;.      } else if(operand === 'multiply'){         // if(....           return num1 * num2;                            .      } else if (operand === 'subtract'){        // if (... .           return num1 - num2;.      } else {.           console.log(""not a valid operand"");.      };. };...i am a beginner in blank looking to learn and maintain good coding habits. i understand the function above would run regardless of my inconsistent spacing, but is there a correct way of spacing blank control loops? ..any advice or coding examples will help! thanks!"
