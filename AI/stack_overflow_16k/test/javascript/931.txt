"new line in blank strings i've seen a few questions about how to add a new line in blank strings. most of them are suggesting to use n. i tried that but the new line is not inserted on my html...instead i get the following:..&lt;strong&gt;this is the first line . this is the second line&lt;/strong&gt;...this is my string:..var mystring = ""this is the first line n this is the second line"";...example..any idea on how i can get a  inserted on my html?"
