"turning this string into an object i have this string (which is called data)..||id: ticket/327364|subject: testsubject|due: 2018||--||id: ticket/327366|subject: testtwo|due: 2018|||...that i want to turn into an object that is accessible using key/values..step 1 is splitting the string on ""--"" and removing all the ""|"" signs. which i did like this..var dataarray = [];.data.split(""--"").foreach(function(x) {.    var arr = x.split(""|"");.    arr = arr.filter(function(e) {.        return e;.    });.    dataarray.push(arr);.});...this gives me a multidimensional array..[array(3), array(3)].    0: [""id: ticket/327364"", ""subject: best채llning av inkoppling"", ""due: ej inst채lld""].    1: [""id: ticket/327366"", ""subject: best채llning av inkoppling"", ""due: ej inst채lld""]...and this is where i am stuck, because i want to split each of these arrays on "":"". so object.due will give me the due-date and object.subject gives me the subject etc. also, it's not always going to be id, subject, and due. sometimes it might be less or more entries...i have tried this..var result = {};.dataarray.foreach(function(x) {.    x.foreach(function(y) {.       var newarr = y.split("":"");.       newarr[1] &amp;&amp; (result[newarr[0]] = newarr[1]);.    });.});...which gives me exactly what i want, it gives me an object like this...{id: "" ticket/327366"", subject: "" testtwo"", due: "" 2018""}...however, result only contains the data from the last array. it's like it overwrites the first one. any suggestions on how to re-do this? also, it feels like an awful lot of loops but i've only been dabbling with js for a day or two so i haven't really figured out a different way of doing it."
