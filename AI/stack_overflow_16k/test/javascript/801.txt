"accordeon does not open - except when i click ""back""-button on browser this is my second try to ask this question. last time, the admin closed the subject because he thought that it was some link-building try or whatever..he thought the link i posted was from a gaming site - but that's absolutely wrong! it's about campervans, and it has nothing to do with link-building..so i hope this time i am a bit more lucky, because i really need your help:..on the website called camperhero (a german site, this time no link), i am using an accordeon...when i enter the site and try to click the accordeon (below ""das camperhero 1x1 f√ºr australien""), it does not open. only the url changes and adds a /#collapse7 at the end...but the strange thing is: when i move on to another page of this website, and after that click the ""back"" button of my browser, i can open the accordeon...i don't understand why it only works after having used the ""back""-button!..maybe you have an idea?..thank you for your help,.peter from germany..edit: dev-tools shows me an error message:..uncaught typeerror: e is not a function.at bootstrap.min.js:6.at bootstrap.min.js:6...so for some reason, js does not load, i suppose. when i go to another page and hit the back button, the error-message disappears and the accordeon opens...i am using js for bootstrap, the code looks like this:..&lt;script async src=""js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;script async src=""js/bootstrap.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; ...does that help you?"
