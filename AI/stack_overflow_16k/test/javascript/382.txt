"numbers and letters generator i have been looking for ages for a generator that would generate letter, numbers and symbols. for example, using either blank or php, it would print out:..a ..b ..c...etc. etc. etc...aa..ab..ac...etc. etc. etc...aab..aac..aad...etc. etc. etc...i am horrible when it comes to any mathematical equations (i assume this would require blank as opposed to php)...does anyone know of either a generator or a website explaining how to do this. i tried googling it, but the terms i use keep having some random generators popping up :/..edit: i have found this code. any suggestions in implementing symbols with it, as well as mixing everything up? for example, ab1@..&lt;?php.$i = 'a';.for ($n=0; $n&lt;200; $n++) {.    echo ++$i . '&lt;br/&gt;'. ""n"";.}.?&gt;...i modified it to this so far :/ missing quite a few things i know....-i have no clue how to add symbols in there..-nor how to mix all of it correctly..-and i can't seem to start from a or 0...modified code..&lt;?php.    $i = 'a';.    $m = '1';.    for ($n=0; $n&lt;200; $n++) {.        echo ++$i . ++$m . '&lt;br/&gt;'. ""n"";.    }.    ?&gt;"
