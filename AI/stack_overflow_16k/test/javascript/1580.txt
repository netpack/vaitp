"difference between let arrayname = [...this.a, this.b] and let arrayname = [...this.a] arrayname.push(this.b) so ive been watching freecodecamp's vue youtube tutorial...at one point they use this code:..let answers = [...this.currentquestion.incorrect_answers];.answers.push(this.currentquestion.correct_answer);...and then this one:..let answers = [...this.currentquestion.incorrect_answers, this.currentquestion.correct_answer]...are they any different? im more familiar with the push method, but if the other method works and doesnt have any downsides, why bother pushing?"
