"preloading images in blank (need an alert when completed) i have the following code below, which successfully preloads images into the browser cache when the preloadallimages function is called. does anyone know how to send a simple alert, e.g. ""all images have been preloaded into the browser cache."" when the last image (or all images) is loaded. i have 300 images, so settimeout won't work for latency/download lag reasons. i've tried callbacks, placing alert commands in different places, etc... but have not been successful...this code is based on blank only method #1 found here. https://perishablepress.com/3-ways-preload-images-css-blank-ajax/..function preloadallimages() {.  var images = new array();.  function preload() {.    for (i = 0; i &lt; preload.arguments.length; i++) {.      images[i] = new image();.      images[i].src = preload.arguments[i];.    }.  }..  preload('images/image1.jpg', 'images/image2.jpg', ... , 'images/image300.jpg');.}"
