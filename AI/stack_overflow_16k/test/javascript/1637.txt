"non-standard dc.js chart with crossfilter.js i should build a dc.js chart with x-axis based on weeks and to colour the weeks (like a bar chart but with bars having fixed height) applying a rule on the type of facts that are within the week...example:..dimension: weeks.facts gruped in 2 groups (new cars, used cars).rule: ..if (new cars sold in the current week &gt;= 1) week color = green.  else if (used car sold in the current week &gt;= 1) week color = yellow.  else color = red    ...the chart should appear as an horizontal bar (or week size aligned bars) having different colurs on the weeks depending by the result of the rule...on the dc.js side i try to use a bar chart (but don't know how to fix the height).on the crossfilters.js i do not find how collect the facts within a week for applying the rule...any ideas ?.thanks in advance!"
