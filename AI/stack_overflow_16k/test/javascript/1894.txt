"is array with one element equal to the element? i am doing some comparisons in blank. i copied over some code like this:..if (input.val() != input.data('original') ).    //do stuff...i expect i will have to change something, because at this instance input was &lt;select multiple&gt; with a number of selectable options limited to 1. but it worked without changes...i checked and it turns out that:..13 == [13]  //true.13 === [13]  //false...i did not expect that the comparison would unwrap the array. ..is this an intended and documented feature in blank that i can use and rely on? or does this only work for me because some browser developer decided to make it work?"
