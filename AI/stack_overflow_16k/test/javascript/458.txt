"inserting object literal into array i don't understand why the splice method isn't working for me. i have an array that looks like: (it is actually bigger but i didn't want to clutter the page)..var navitems = [ {.                    ""content"": ""panels"",.                    ""icon"": ""panels"".                },.                {.                    ""content"": ""samples"",.                    ""icon"": ""sample"".                }];...i want to insert an item say in the middle:..var testnavitems = navitems.splice(1, 0, {.                    ""content"": ""new nav"",.                    ""icon"": ""new nav"".                   });.console.log(testnavitems);...or..var testnavitems = navitems.push({.                    ""content"": ""new nav"",.                    ""icon"": ""new nav"".                   });.console.log(testnavitems);...i get an empty array.  is this possible in js?"
