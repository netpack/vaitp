"get all the coincidences with given value from object array i have this array of objects:..var hola = [{key:id , desc:description }];.// they are filled with data with ajax from a table...this are the values right now..    var hola = [.             {key: ""al-32021611"", descc: ""7500""}, .             {key: ""al-32021612"", descc: ""continental""}, .             {key: ""al-32021612"", descc: ""r3""}, .             {key: ""al-32021612"", descc: ""7500""}.             ];...what i need is that with a given value i get for example..   newarr= {key:al-32021612}[descc:""continental"", ""r3"", ""7500""]...but from this 'newarr' i just need the key like some kind of index to get all its descc values in a var and im really lost and here is why..$.each(newarr, function (i, data) .{ trhtml = '&lt;div class=""three_col_to_one_col categories""&gt;' + idval[i] +'&lt;/div&gt;' })...i will use this newarr as the length of this each and print its content but i just need this descc values for that, its complicated and messy but im new and i might get downvotes but thanks for reading me anyway"
