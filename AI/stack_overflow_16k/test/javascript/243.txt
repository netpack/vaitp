"why is typeof x never 'number' when x comes from the prompt function? i'm having trouble getting the first function (below) to work correctly. i want it to ask for the age of the user with two possible outcomes. if the user enters the correct value (i.e an positive number) it should return the the age. on the other hand, if the user enters an incorrect value (string, null, undefined, negative number), it should display an alert message, and have the user repeat the process until a correct value is entered and returned. ..function age_of_user() {.    let age_entered = prompt(""enter your age:""); .    while (typeof age_entered !== ""number"" || age_entered &lt; 0) {.       alert(""you entered an incorrect value. please enter correct age."");.       age_entered = prompt(""enter your age:"");.    }   .return age_entered;.}..function confirm_age() {.    let age = age_of_user();.    if (age &lt; 18) {.        alert(""sorry! you need to be an adult to view content."");.    }.    else {.        alert(""welcome to our site."");.    }.}..confirm_age();"
