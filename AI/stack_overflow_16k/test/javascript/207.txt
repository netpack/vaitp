"blank break/return function within function i have always been confused about the best way to handle this. the method i have been using in the past works but it seems like there has to be a better way...below i have a section of code that i'm wanting to return item for the function getdata. problem is in the example below it's returning for the foreach function not the getdata function...function getdata() {.    var array = [""element1"",""element2""];.    array.foreach(function (item) {.        if (item == ""element2"") {.            return item;.        }.    }); .}...i have been doing something like this to overcome this...function getdata() {.    var array = [""element1"",""element2""];.    var returnvalue;.    array.foreach(function (item) {.        if (item == ""element2"") {.            returnvalue = item;.        }.    });.    if (returnvalue) {.        return returnvalue;.    }.}...is there a better way to handle this? seems like those extra 4 lines of code just create confusion and clutter in my code."
