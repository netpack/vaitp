"how can i call a possibly-non-existent method, without errors, in one line in blank? i was writing a program that uses blank and creates inheritance in a way...if the user types in:..x.issingleline()...and it does not exist, it crashes blank.  i was hoping there was a way to do something like:..x.issingleline() || ""doesnt exist"";...to in a way have it do a soft error or some sort of alert.  i didnt want to have to encapsulate the object in a try-catch block...is there a way this can be accomplished?..in the statement: x.issingleline() || ""doesnt exist""; it will crash and not do the or part, so this is not the answer apparently."
