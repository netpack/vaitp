"is there any way to distinguish between an unset property and a property set to undefined? say i have the object testobject = {a: undefined}. if i then console.log(testobject.a), i get undefined. but the same happens if i console.log(testobject.b), which doesn't exist. is there any way in blank to distinguish between a and b here? i ask mostly out of curiosity, i have no use case."
