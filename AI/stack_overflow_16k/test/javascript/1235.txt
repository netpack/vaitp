"check if an obj is empty array is there some native/lodash/underscore/etc method to check if an obj is an empty array? [] === [] returns false due to different obj references. i wrote a quick checker for it:..  function isarrayoflength(obj, length) {.    var isarrayofspecifiedlength = false; ..    if(array.isarray(obj)){ .      if(obj.length === length){.        isarrayofspecifiedlength = true; .      }.    }..    return isarrayofspecifiedlength; .  } ...but i don't want to clutter up production code if something better is available. plunk if you want it for whatever reason. note - i need to be able to check any var type - the method might get an obj or an int, so i can't just check length without verifying that it's an array."
