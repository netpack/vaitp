"why can't i execute blank function inside the <script> tag that defines the .js source? i am defining the source of a .js file and attempting to call a function from that file in the same  tag, as follows:..&lt;script type=""text/blank"" src=""jsfunctiontest.js""&gt;.    testmethodcall();.&lt;/script&gt;...the .js file just contains:..function testmethodcall(){.    window.alert(""hello there"");.}...this doesn't work, i don't see the alert...however, if i change the  tag to two tags, as below, then it works:..&lt;script type=""text/blank"" src=""jsfunctiontest.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;.    testmethodcall();.&lt;/script&gt;...this seems pretty messy. is there any reason the first one doesn't work?"
