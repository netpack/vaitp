"blank this keyword and variables pointing to an object method i'm trying to understand how the this keyword works in this context...function person(name) {.    this.name = name;.    this.sayname = function() {.        alert('my name is ' + this.name);.    };.}...var p = new person('smith');.p.sayname();  // 'my name is smith'..var q = p;..q.sayname();  // 'my name is smith'..q = p.sayname;..q();  // 'my name is'   ???...why is the last example not picking up 'smith'?  ..is it because q is simply pointing to a function (i.e. the object the method belongs to is not recognized in this context)? since q is in the global space, this is global within the function (i.e. the caller of sayname() is the global space or window)?"
