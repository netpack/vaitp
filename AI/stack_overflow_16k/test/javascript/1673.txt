"blank advice for dynamic replacing content i need an advice how to dynamically change html data...my web page will have some form, which will call a php function, which i am planing to return json array (i can accept also other output, except raw html). .than i want the page content to be replaced with the json values...the idea of that is to have the html code separated from the php function...can you please tell me if this is a good practice and if yes, can you please give me some example ?..thanks in advice !"
