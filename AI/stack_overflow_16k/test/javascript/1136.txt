"bind hover (mouseenter / mouseleave) event to dynamic content with blank (without jquery) i wrote an event delegation function in blank:..function matches(el, selector) {.   var test = (el.matches || el.matchesselector || el.msmatchesselector || el.mozmatchesselector || el.webkitmatchesselector || el.omatchesselector);.   if (test).      return test.call(el, selector);.   return false;.}..function delegation(node, child, evt, fn, limit) {.   node.addeventlistener(evt, function (e) {.      //maximum number of ancestors i'm going to check.      limit = limit ? limit : 2;.      e = e || event;.      var target = e.target || e.srcelement, i = 0, fire = false;.      while (target) {.        if (matches(target, child)) {.         //break out of the loop if i find the matching dom element, then fire the event.         fire = true;.         break;.        }.        if (i &gt; limit) {.         break;.        }.      i++;.      //if event.target doesn't has id/class/tag ""child"", check its ancestors..      target = target.parentnode;.      }.      if (fire) {.         fn(target, e);.      }.   }, false);.}...usage: delegation(document, 'class-or-id-or-tagname', 'event-name', function, query-limit);.it works relatively well until i stumbled upon mouse enter and mouse leave events. the problem is that the events are only triggered when my mouse leave or enter document window, not dom element, i do understand the problem why but i can't seem to fix it. is there any way to replicate ..$(document).on('mouseenter, dom , function).on('mouseleave', dom, function);..in pure blank...edit: thanks for all the comments, i found out that there's nothing wrong with my code. i just need to use the correct event name when calling the delegation function, mouseenter should be mouseover, mouseleave should be mouseout..changing from ..delegation(document, '.some-class-name', 'mouseenter', function(){});...to ..delegation(document, '.some-class-name', 'mouseover', function(){});...works wonder."
