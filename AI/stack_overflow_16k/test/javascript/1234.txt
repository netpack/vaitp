"javacript - set timeout script i am trying to use inline blank to set a timeout for a link i am calling on my website:..&lt;a href=""blank:settimeout(()=&gt;{window.location = 'thankyou.html' },2500);"" class=""burst_1 btn""&gt;elementary school camp&lt;/a&gt;...it works in chrome but not in firefox or internet explorer. i tried to search online for alternatives but nothing has worked for me so far. i need a timeout because the buttons i am using on my site have a fireworks effect and i'd like visitors to see the effect for a few seconds before they get sent to the link page...or is there a better way to achieve what i am trying to do? open to suggestions."
