"alter and assign object without side effects i currently have the following code:..var myarray = [];.var myelement = {.  id: 0,.  value: 0.}..myelement.id = 0;.myelement.value = 1;.myarray[0] = myelement;..myelement.id = 2;.myelement.value = 3;.myarray[1] = myelement;...the problem is that when i change the value of id and value for my second element, the values also change in the first element. is there a way that i can keep adding new elements without it changing the value of the previously inserted values in the array?"
