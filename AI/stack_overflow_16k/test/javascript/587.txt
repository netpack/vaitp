"slice() not working as expected hmmm, i have checked everywhere but still haven't been able to cut it... from my google maps site which works but my efforts to ""slice"" the variable ""point"" do not... for (var i = 0; i &lt; markers.length; i++) {.    var point = new google.maps.latlng(.    parsefloat(markers[i].getattribute(""lat"")),.    parsefloat(markers[i].getattribute(""lng"")));...example:.     +point+ (print out the result)..this prints out (28.7035649, -105.9697253) which is correct.....so, i want to strip off the parenthesis using slice()....example:.. point = point.slice(1, -1);.. +point+ (print out the result)...this does not work - uncaught typeerror: point.slice is not a function.....example:.. var str;. str =  point;. str = str.slice(1, -1);. +str+ (print out the result)...this does not work - uncaught typeerror: str.slice is not a function.....example:.this does work:.. var str;. str = ""(28.7035649, -105.9697253)"";. str = str.slice(1, -1);. +str+ (print out the result)...this prints out 28.7035649, -105.9697253 which is correct - no parenthesis...any clues to what is happening here?"
