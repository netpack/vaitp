"detecting how many different types of values in in an array i know i could use variations of this answer to find out how many different types of data there are in an array: ..how to count the number of certain element in an array?..but, what i am looking for is whether there is a simple way to count how many different types of data there are in an array:..i have arrays which may have 0, 1, or 2 as values..so it could be:..a = [1,2,0,1,1,1];...or they may all be the same and a different length:..a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1];...in blank, i would like a function that returns ""1"" if all values are the same, ""2"" if there is a mixture of just two of the possible values, and if the array contains all three values, ""3""...any help appreciated. thanks."
