"creating a blank bookmarklet with variables declared in page absolute novice at js, as a disclaimer...there's a page that exists that has variables declared such as:..c=""hello"".cd=""12345""...and a php viewing script that makes the image only ""accessible"" (it's hidden under a flash layer otherwise"" by a swf that loads:.. (((""view.php?cid="" + c) + ""&amp;cd="") + cd)...so the url ends up looking like.. view.php?cid=hello&amp;cd=12345...would it be possible to turn this into a blank bookmarklet?..thanks..-a..edit for clarity for sno0py:..neither of the pages are my site. it's a site i'm trying to create a bookmarklet for..on the page, there is flashembed.js, which can be used for a multitude of things, but in this case, in used to make it so you can't right click to save an image (makes it a movie, and with a php view script, puts the image in it)...on the page, there is this html/blank:..&lt;div id=""viewer""&gt;.    &lt;!-- image is here --&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;.&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;.    flashembed(""viewer"",.    {src: ""overlay.swf""},.    {c: ""hello"", cd: ""123456""}.    );.&lt;/script&gt;...where #viewer is specified in another js script, and c &amp; cd are randomly generated identifiers for the image...overlay.swf does this:..stage.showmenu = false;.loadmovie (((""http://example.com/view.php?cid="" + c) + ""&amp;cd="") + cd, _root);._root.stop();...so navigating to http://example.com/view.php?cid=hello&amp;cd=123456 would yield the raw data for the image. you can view it with &lt;img src=""view.php?cid=hello&amp;cd=123456""&gt; though...so: to clarify, would i would like, is a blank bookmarklet that grabs c and cd, forms the url, and brings you to a page with just the &lt;img src""yadayada""&gt; from above. if that's not possible, just bringing me to the url would be nice."
