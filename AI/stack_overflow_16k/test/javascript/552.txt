"memory locations of variables with same name (function(spanishgreeting, name){.    var spanishgreeting = 'hola!!';.    spanishgreeting = 'como estas!'.    console.log(spanishgreeting);.}(greeting,'john'));...can someone please explain to me if my understanding of the above code is correct?..so first inside the iife var spanishgreeting = 'hola!!'; this line of code creates a whole new variable with the same name as the parameter that is passed into the iife. so will this new variable declaration overwrite the variable that is passed in as a parameter? so essentially the passed in variable, spanishgreeting will be ignored in the rest of the function...now is the parameter variable spanishgreeting still present in memory? or has the new variable declaration: var spanishgreeting = 'hola!!'; overwritten the memory location of the parameter variable spanishgreeting?"
