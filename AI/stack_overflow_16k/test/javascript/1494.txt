"calculate property at call time without using function invocation syntax is there any pattern i can use to compute a variable at call time (like a property in c#)..var a = (function() {.    var self = {};.    var a = 0;.    self.x = function (){.        a = a+1;.        return a;.    };.    return self;.});...normally, the call would be:..var bla = a.x();...but i would like to evaluate it and get its value as a property:..var bla = a.x;.console.log(bla); // prints ""1""...i don't want the () operator, but i still want to compute/calculate the property value when i access a.x"
