"a for loop that does the same as if else statement? i have an if else statement, i was wondering if i could change it into a for loop or something similar...if (lastscroll &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; lastscroll &lt; 40) {.    pos = 0;.} else if (lastscroll &gt;= 40 &amp;&amp; lastscroll &lt; 80) {.    pos = 1;.} else if (lastscroll &gt;= 80 &amp;&amp; lastscroll &lt; 120) {.    pos = 2;.} else if (lastscroll &gt;= 120 &amp;&amp; lastscroll &lt; 160) {.    pos = 3;.} else if (lastscroll &gt;= 160 &amp;&amp; lastscroll &lt; 200) {.    pos = 4;.} else if (lastscroll &gt; 200) {.    pos = 5;.}...i want to change this because there could be over 100 positions. i was thinking about creating a for loop like this:..var i = 0;.greater = 0;.less = 40;.for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {.    if (lastscroll &gt;= greater &amp;&amp; lastscroll &lt; less) {.        pos = i;.        greater += 40;.        less += 40;.    }..}...the if else statement works perfectly but i don't want to create 100 if else statements. this is wrapped in a scroll function."
