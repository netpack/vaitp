"using ""else if"" instead of ""else"" when there is no other possibility recently, i saw an if/else block like this in blank - although the same question could apply to any imperative language..if (cond) {.  .....} else if (!cond) {.  .....}...question: what is the purpose of if (!cond) after else?  if there is no other possibility, why shouldn't i just use else by itself?  ..my opinion is that the if (!cond) is redundant and should be eliminated, and i'm looking for pointers to documentation to substantiate that."
