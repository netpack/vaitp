"access variable from code run in ""eval"" in blank i know using eval is not at all recommended and i have read this link too. set variable inside eval (blank)..however, this is what i want to do. lets say we have some code in a textbox. so i have to take that text, and then find out all the global variables, functions and objects in that code. .my idea was to wrap the code in a namespace, eval it and then iterate through the properties of the namespace to get the results. however, even though the eval runs successfully, i can't access the variable defined there. is there a better solution or some other way to get this working. ..http://jsfiddle.net/dbref/2/ - this is the fiddle here. ..the ""var code"" could actually be arbitrary code. i know its unsafe to do it but i need it for a different context. .thanks"
