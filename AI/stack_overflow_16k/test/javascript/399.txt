"which method should we use to execute and handle some code and why? i would like to know what is hide under some specifics ways to execute some code...i have 3 different ways to do in my mind, but i really don't know which is better on what kind of situation and why. .i just choose the case 2 method most of the time for a syntaxical preference, but i am more and more wondering what are the advantages and disadvantages of each method...case 1:..var response = func();.//handle response......case 2:..func(response){.  //handle response....};...case 3:..func({.  case_x: function(opt){.    //handle an example case....  }.});...thanks for the explanations i am very curious about that !"
