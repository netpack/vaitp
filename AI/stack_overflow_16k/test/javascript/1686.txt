"split string to maximum length and append the rest to the last array item is there a way for me to split a string into an array and limit to x and if there are more parts than the limit append to the last array item?..so, for example i have..'billy bob joe'.split(' ', 2) // outputs [""billy"", ""bob""]...i would like to output ..[""billy"", ""bob joe""]...is there a way for this to be easily done in blank?"
