"blank: shorten each word in properties of object to fixed length? is there anyway to take an object like: .. {.   ""computer_general_last_contact_time_epoch"": 1566522907515,.   ""computer_general_last_contact_time_utc"": ""2019-08-23t01:15:07.515+0000"",.   ""computer_general_initial_entry_date"": ""2018-08-18"",. }...and make each property name shorter so that each word better _ characters of object keys are shortened to a fixed character length. so for instance, shortening to a fixed length of 3 characters would produce:..{.   ""com_gen_las_con_tim_epo"": 1566522907515,.   ""com_gen_las_con_tim_utc"": ""2019-08-23t01:15:07.515+0000"",.   ""com_gen_ini_ent_dat"": ""2018-08-18"",.}...would i have to create a new object? iterate through each object in my current object, use regex to remove all '_' and then shorten each word then add them all together with _ inbetween? i'm super lost on this as i have objects with 100's of properties that i need to shorten for an integration and any advice would help!"
