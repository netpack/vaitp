"newly created objects from class return undefined i've created a player class with some methods in it. i can create a player successfully, but when i go to call another method on the newly created player, i get undefined...while the player class will ultimately be used in another class class scoreboard extends player, i can't see why i can't invoke functions on a player object...here's my player class:..class player {..  constructor(player_id, score) {.   this.player_id = player_id;.   this.scores = [score];.   this.total = score;.    }..  addscore(score) {.    this.total += score;.    this.scores.push(score);.  }..  averagescore() {.    return this.scores.length ? this.total / this.scores.length : 0;.  }..  resetscore() {.    this.scores = [];.    this.score = 0;.    }..  };...i create a new player with the following: const john = new player(2, 50); and call john, which in my console returns:..player {player_id: 2, scores: array(1), total: 50}.player_id: 2.scores: (2) [50, 70].total: 120.__proto__: object...immediately after that, i call john.addscore(70) and get undefined. i would have thought that using this would prevent any undefined errors. what's wrong with my class?"
