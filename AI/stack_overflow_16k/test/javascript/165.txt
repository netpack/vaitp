"a more clean way to put items into grid and adjacent boxes? i have an array of array of arrays that represents a grid. in this case a 2x3 grid, the size of the grid is based on the size of the window...let grid = [.  [[], [], [],],//row.  [[], [], [],] //row.]...i want to put references to this in the cells, and the neighboring cells, based on their position. this is the best i've come up with, but it already feels clunky. what would be a more clean solution?..getcell(pos, arr, type){.  console.log(type, pos, arr.length).  if(pos &gt;= arr.length){.    return 0.  }.  if(pos &lt; 0){.    return arr.length-1.  }.  return pos.}..setnearby(grid) {.  let col = math.floor(this.position.y / grid.dimensions.height),.      row = math.floor(this.position.x / grid.dimensions.width),.      offset = [-1, 0, 1];.  offset.foreach((rowoffset) =&gt; {.    offset.foreach((coloffset)=&gt;{.      let pushrow = this.getcell(row+rowoffset, grid.grid).      let pushcol = this.getcell(col+coloffset, grid.grid[pushrow]).      grid.grid[pushrow][pushcol].push(this).    }).  }).}"
