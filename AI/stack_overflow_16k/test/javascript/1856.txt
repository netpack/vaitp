"if statement not executing correct code? so i am trying to develop a tic tac toe game for practice with blank but i've hit a roadblock. i have an if statement that should be returning true but it isn't.  here is a sample...var game = true;.var x = 'x';.var o = 'o';.var blank = '';..var turn = x;.var board = [blank, blank, blank,.             blank, blank, blank,.             blank, blank, blank];..function write() {..    $('td').click(function() {.        //making sure that the block that was clicked can only be clicked once.        var id = $(event.target).attr('id');.        var digit = parseint(id.slice(-1));.        //check to see of the block has been clicked on.        if (board[digit] = blank) {.            board[digit] = turn;.            $(board[digit]).html(turn.touppercase());.            if (turn = x) {.                turn = o;.            } else if (turn = o) {.                turn = x;.            }..        } else {.            alert(""that box has already been clicked on!"").        }.    }); ..}"
