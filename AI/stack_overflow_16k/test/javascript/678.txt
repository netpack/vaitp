"blank calculation for working out price depending on what is entered i am trying to come up with a solution using blank that calculates the price of something depending on what is entered. the default price is £1000 but if the quantity goes over 5.5, the price increases by £250 for each 0.1 until the total price reaches £50,000. the way i would have approached this is using an if statement however in this situation this will not be viable. is there a way to do this using a for loop?"
