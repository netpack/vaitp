"blank regex positive look behind given the string: x = 'it is 2.5i in'.what is wrong with this code x.replace(/(?&lt;=d+.d+)i/gi,''). so that the outcome is ""it is 2.5 in""?  ..the code gives a console error on chrome. ...  invalid regular expression: /(?&lt;=d+.d+)i/:...that is, the code needs to use regex to remove the letter ""i"" only if it is after a digit followed by a dot followed by a digit. thx"
