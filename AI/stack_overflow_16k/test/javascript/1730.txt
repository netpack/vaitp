"is there an easy way to find code that is preventing event default? this issue has come up for me a few times:..i write some code that handles an event, for example a click. i click the element and nothing happens. some other code is calling e.preventdefault() before my code has the chance to handle it. ..question:.is there a way to find the code that is preventing default that i have overlooked?..i usually solve this by running blank profiler in firebug and looking at every function that is called during the click (not inside jquery etc) that may be doing the evil. there has to be a better way."
