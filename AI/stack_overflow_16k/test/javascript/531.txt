"how to get referrer url after a redirect in blank if you enter an invalid video id in youtube (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxx) it will redirect you to a page saying it is a malformed video id. is there a way to get the original url (in this example ""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxx"") in blank?..(i'm talking about blank that will run on the browser after the redirect, through firebug)"
