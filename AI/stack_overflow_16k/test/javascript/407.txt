"trying to find out one of my overflowed div's heights thanks to .scrollheight i'm trying to figure out my content div's height when overflowed with content thanks to the nifty .scrollheight blank function. however, when i alert this height i'm getting an ""undefined"" result. i'm fairly new to blank so i might have made some really dumb mistake:..http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gjovvd..basically looks like this in my html (because stack overflow doesn't let me just post codepen links):..&lt;script&gt;var intelemscrollheight = document.getelementsbyclassname(""content"").scrollheight;.alert(intelemscrollheight + "" px"");.&lt;/script&gt;...i made a quick codepen which really resembles my problem, except that the height of my content container in my actual project depends on the height of the header, but that changes naught i believe, as i'm still getting that ""undefined""."
