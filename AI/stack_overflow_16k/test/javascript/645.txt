"blank retrieve the browsing history from a new tab page in blank world, if i click on a button on page a and it opens up a new tab (calling it page b), is it possible to get page a's browsing history from page b? in my case there isn't a way to make changes on page a, so sending data via query string or something like that is not doable. all i'm needing is to get the url that page b comes from. thanks!"
