"js calculate mean of same elements in 2d array i've got a 'table' of two columns represented as an array. the first column are numbers from 1 to 20 and they are labels, the second column are the corresponding values (seconds):..my_array = [ [ 3,4,5,3,4,5,2 ],[ 12,14,16,11,12,10,20 ] ];...i need the mean (average) for each label:..my_mean_array = [ [ 2,3,4,5 ],[ 20/1, (12+11)/2, (14+12)/2, (16+10)/2 ] ];.// edit: the mean should be a float - the notion above is just for clarification..// also the number 'labels' should remain as numbers/integers....my try:..var a = my_array[0];.var b = my_array[1];.m = [];.n = [];.for( var i = 0; a.length; i++){.    m[ a[i] ] += b[i]; // accumulate the values in the corresponding place.    n[ a[i] ] += 1; // count the occurences.}.var o = [];.var p = [];.o = m / n;.p.push(n);.p.push(o);"
