"manipulate replace string in blank i have three variables in blank like..var a = document.getelementbyid(""txtordernumberrelease1"").value;.var b  = document.getelementbyid(""txtordernumberrelease2"").value .var c = document.getelementbyid(""ddlordernumberrelease3"");...and..var mainstring =""roam-lcd-synergy-789-456-llx warranty""...in mainstring, the value ""789"" is coming from variable ""a"", .value ""456"" is coming from variable b and value ""llx"" is coming from variable ""c""..variables ""a"" and ""b"" will always be integers, whereas variable ""c"" will always be one the three values ie. ""lli,lla,llx""...before value ""789"", there can be any number of words splitted by hypen ""-"". like roam-lcd-synergy-ssi etc....but after the value of variable ""c"" i.e ""llx"" in mainstring, there can be only one word for eg. ""warranty""...now my issue is, i have to replace these three values of ""a"",""b"" and ""c""  ie. ""789-456-llx"" with my newly entered values lets say  987-654-lla, then my desired final string would be..old string:        mainstring =""roam-lcd-synergy-789-456-llx warranty""..desired string:    mainstring =""roam-lcd-synergy-987-654-lla warranty""..please suggest some wayout...thanks"
