"first next/previous substring positions in blank let's say i have a long string, for instance:..var sentence = ""marry had a little lamb, peter had a little wolf, the wolf ate the little lamb and the little wolf was happy."";...i need to find the position of the substring ""peter"" inside the string...that, of course, is var pos = sentence.indexof(""peter"");...but now i have a problem - i need to find the last occurrence of the substring ""lamb"" before pos and the first occurrence of the substring ""wolf"" after pos...how do i do that? pure blank please, no jquery."
