"processing svg and fill in specific area i'm writing an app, and want my users to be able to upload their images and then have the ability to colorize certain objects in it. ..example:  1.  https://www.visualizecolor.com/glidden#/stockphoto?projectid=f1c432bd-8e17-45b0-93a0-acef22f48d2d.          2. https://www.sherwin-williams.com/visualizer#/active..i've tried this solution change particular area of an image and fill color in that area but again i don't know how to adjust the svg paths when the user uploads a new photo."
