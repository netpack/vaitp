"what is the coding technique called? function[]() i was doing some blank exercises, i solved it. but in another solution i saw this.....this.queue(.    buf.tostring()[.        nlines++ % 2 === 0? 'touppercase' : 'tolowercase']() + 'n');...where as i did this.....var line = buf.tostring();.this.queue(linecount % 2 === 0.        ? line.tolowercase() + 'n'.        : line.touppercase() + 'n'.    );...passing in the [] after the function, what that technique called?..i've seen something like that in swift, passing closures if they are the last parameter. i'm assuming it's the same, but can't quite find it on google cause i don't know the words. not even close"
