"what does crockford mean when he says that undefined cannot be a property value? in the book blank the good parts, on the opening page of ch3 on objects, it states:...  an object is a container of properties, where a property has a name and a value. a property name can be any string, including the empty string. a property value can be any blank value except for undefined....note: undefined is highlighted in the book to denote that is is a literal...in practice, however, i am able to do it...var a = { ""name"": undefined };...what is wrong with my understanding ?"
