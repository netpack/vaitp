"how to execute something after finishing map function? i want to execute something after finishing the map function....i thought we could use the callback function as follows. but it doesn't exist, so it didn't work:..this.data.map((v, i) =&gt; {.    console.log(""in map func"");.}, () =&gt; {.   console.log(""callback of map"");             .});..so i changed it like this..var last = this.data.length;..this.data.map((v, i) =&gt; {.    console.log(""in map func"");.    if(i + 1 === last) {.        console.log(""last!!"");.    }.});....it worked, but if someone knows a better way, tell me please...add..this.data.map((v, i) =&gt; {.    settimeout(function(){ console.log(""in map""); }, 3000);.});..console.log(""after map"");...â†‘ ""after map"" shows at first on this code..  (my purpose is using ajax in map func)"
