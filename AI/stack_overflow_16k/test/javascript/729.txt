"how do you toggle the visibility of an html element in blank? i was wondering if anyone could figure out why my function won't work properly. what i am trying to achieve is when a button is clicked it displays text and when it is clicked again it hides it and so on...function hideshow (){.    var showhide=document.getelementbyid('text');.    if(showhide.style.display=""none"").    {.        showhide.style.display=""block"";.    }.    else{.        showhide.style.display=""none"";.    }.}...so far i got it to display my text when i click it once, but once i click it again it has no effect on the text."
