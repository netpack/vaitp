computing the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edge length im trying to figure out how to write a blank program that computes and outputs the volume of a regular tetrahedron. this is how far i got but it seems to get a error and not compute the right numbers after. ..the equation for the triangle is ..v = a3..6 âˆš 2..sorry about the code i dont know how to post things on here very effectively. so this is my variables..var a =  parsefloat(document.getelementbyid('length').value);.var b = (a * a * a) / 6 * math.sqrt(2)
