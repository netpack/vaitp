"blank garbage collector not collecting settimeout()s? i have a function:..function test().{.            for( var i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++ ).            {.                settimeout( function().                {.                    //.                }, 10000 );.            }.}...running this on chrome, it propels memory usage from around 50mb to 600mb, which i guess is ok; but after the timeouts have been executed, the garbage collector doesn't seem to remove them from memory, and it just stays at 600mb until i refresh, even then though it leaves some sort of ""foot print"" of 150mb after the page refresh...any idea how to tell the garbage collector to get rid of them after their execution?"
