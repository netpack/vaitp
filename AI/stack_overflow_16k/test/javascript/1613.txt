"trying to loop over dom nodes, and get the value which is in text format trying to scrape this site for some data https://steam.tools/itemvalue/#/wowgoldtrader-730..i figured it would be simple with blank, the script i am trying to make will get all values with:..let el = document.queryselectorall('.price');..and then output the inner text with something like this...for(i = 0; i &lt; el.length; i++) { el[i].innertext}..for some reason the output in the console only gives me the last element price.. if someone see the bug or know why this is not working please let me know"
