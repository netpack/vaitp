"how to start developing blank apps? i started out with rails development, but soon i realized rails without js is pretty much useless. so, i am trying to play with js in my free time...so, what are the ""tools of trade (ides if any)"" for js development?..my primary focus is usage of apis, ajax etc, so that i don't get lost when i get develop rails apps which uses js. ..there are many tutorials for using js for open graph api or twitter api, but that is to get things done and abstract some feature sets which a beginner should know...i generally start learning a language by making a calculator, end to end (always works for me). but i cannot make a calculator and use api/ajax calls...so, what are your suggestions?..ps: i am aware about douglas crockford's video lectures, they are awesome, but i need some thing more concrete...update:..my 2 original questions:.1. what are the tools of trade for js? like eclipse:java::x:blank, what is x (multiple xs are allowed)?.2. what sample app do you recommend for me to start with?"
