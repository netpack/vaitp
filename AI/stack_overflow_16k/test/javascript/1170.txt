"how to split only if delimiter is present? i want to split a url only if it has query parameters.  when i do something like this;..var url = window.location.href;.var somevalue = url.split(""?"");...somevalue has the url value even if ""?"" is not there.  is there a way to split only if the delimiter is there?  meaning, as a single or one line function rather than indexof() or something similar?"
