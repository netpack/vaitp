"start image swap blank from fixed server time i'm setting up a very simple mobile site for a charity and they want to show their own ad banners for local supporting businesses on the bottom. i've got a simple blank which swaps the image banner every 10 seconds for the next in the sequence:..window.onload = function ().{.    var rotator = document.getelementbyid(""adbox"");.    var images = rotator.getelementsbytagname(""img"");.    for (var i = 1; i &lt; images.length; i++).    {.      images[i].style.display = ""none"";.    }.    var counter = 1;.    setinterval(function ().    {.       for (var i = 0; i &lt; images.length; i++).       {.          images[i].style.display = ""none"";.       }.       images[counter].style.display = ""block"";.       counter++;.       if (counter == images.length).       {.         counter = 0;.       }.    }, 7000); //1000 = 1 second.};..&lt;body ontouchstart=""""&gt;.    &lt;div id=""adbox""&gt;.        &lt;img src=""_/ads/1.jpg"" alt=""one"" width=""320"" height=""70""&gt;.        &lt;img src=""_/ads/2.jpg"" alt=""two"" width=""320"" height=""70""&gt;.        &lt;img src=""_/ads/3.jpg"" alt=""three"" width=""320"" height=""70""&gt;.    &lt;div&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;...however this resets and goes back to the start of the sequence when you load a different page. what i want to do is start the sequence at a fixed server time (say midnight) and just cycle through, so that when you load a new page, you don't go back to the start of the banners but go to the 'ad for that server time'...i think this is the simplest and fairest way for the ads. i did look at using an iframe but it would mean the main site would have to sit in one and i believe the support of iframes on touch devices is not great (which would be a major issue for this)."
