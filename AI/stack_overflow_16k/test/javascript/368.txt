"significance of qq in blank i read the answers to this question and understand what the code ..var qq = qq || {};...is doing, but what is the significance of qq in general.  is it just common practice to use qq as opposed to zz or bb or ag?  or does it have to be the letters qq?  ..if it does have to be the letters qq, then what is qq?"
