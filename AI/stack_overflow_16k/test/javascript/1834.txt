"how to use this _curryn function? i'm first in js curry(i have seen curry in ocaml before)...i have found some function which represents curry function...i just know curry make it possible like    ..add(1)(2)(3).= add(1,2)(3).= add(1,2,3).= 6...but i cannot understand why it does not go into the function()(second line) when i apply .._curryn(3,[],add)...it just goes into _curryn and end while not going into the inner function...i cannot understand totally the logic of this function. please help...function _curryn(length, received, fn) {  .    return function() {  .        var combined = [];   .        var argsidx = 0;  .        var left = length;.        var combinedidx = 0;.        while (combinedidx &lt; received.length || argsidx &lt; arguments.length) {        .            var result;.            if (combinedidx &lt; received.length) {.                result = received[combinedidx];.            } else {.                result = arguments[argsidx];.                argsidx += 1;.            }.                combined[combinedidx] = result; .                left -= 1;      .                combinedidx += 1;.            }.        return left &lt;= 0 ? fn(...combined).            :_arity(left, _curryn(length, combined, fn));.    };.}    ...i thought naively that.._curryn(3,[],add)...go into function and while since argsidx is smaller than ..arguments.length...but even it does not go into function()"
