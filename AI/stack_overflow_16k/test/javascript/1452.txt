"blank typeerror: variable is undefined only for accessing index if i write the following code:..    f();.    function f(v) {.        var a  = v;.    }...the browser gives no warning/error in the console. but if i write..    f();.    function f(v) {.        var a  = v['hellp'];.    }...then it throws : typeerror: v is undefined. although the variable ""v"" was not defined in both cases. can someone explain this?"
