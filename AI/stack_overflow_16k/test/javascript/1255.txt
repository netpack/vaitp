"can i determine the instance variable name from within an object's method? i'm trying to create a blank object that creates a set of dom elements (img tags to be specific) -- four functions (methods) are part of the object, one builds the group of icons, three are event handlers: click, mouseover, and mouseout...to properly define the event handlers, i need to know the name of the local variable that is the instance of my object, but can find no way to determine it...in the web page:......var ip = new iconpicker(...)....  &lt;/script&gt; .....&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""ip.buildit(""daimagebox""); return false;""&gt;bob's icon picker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div id=""daimagebox"" class=""iconpickbox""  hidden&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;...in the js file:..function iconpicker(...) { ... }..iconpicker.prototype.imageclicked = function(ctrl) { ... }..iconpicker.prototype.buildit(divname) {. ... ""&lt;img ... onclick='___.imageclicked(this)' ... /&gt;""....in this example, the ___ needs to be filled in with ""ip""  -- but how to determine that???..assume there's a css file with the classes et al defined...the uber-tricky part (or likely simple if one already knows the trick) is that all three handlers need a parameter that is the dom instance of the clicked (or hovered) component. ..this is communicated above with the 'this' parameter to the imageclicked() call -- but 'this' has a different meaning inside an object method, and what i'm slamming into is the dual-need in the same definition: i need this handler method to be sent 'this' parameter...granted, determining the name of the instance variable is a cheesy, hacky solution -- but it would solve the problem."
