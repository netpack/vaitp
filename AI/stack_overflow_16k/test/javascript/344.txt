"is possible to pass to a function the properties of an object without the arguments defined and use them by the object's keys? quick and strange question:..i have an object (in this example is small but in the project is larger):..var myobject = {.   hello: 1, // easier i think.   'hey.ya': 5 // quite impossible but the first option is valid too.}...then i want to pass somehow to a function and use ""hello"" for example in a closure like this..function x(){.// my closure.   return function(){this.init = function(){alert(hello)}, this.heyya = function(){alert(/* i do not know how to call the other hey.ya variable */)}}.}..var myclass = x(), instance = new myclass(); instance.init();...thanks!"
