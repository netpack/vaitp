how do i click the non-browser area to close the right-click menu generated by js? i used js to listen to the contextmenu event to create a menu that closes when the mouse clicks on another area..i found that the google cloud disk's right-click menu can be closed when clicking on a non-page area. how do i do this or what event is being monitored?
