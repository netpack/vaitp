"setting an audio source to a variable so i was wondering if something like this is possible in blank...&lt;audio id=""audio""&gt;.    &lt;source src=""youraudio.mp3"" type=""audio/mp3""&gt;.&lt;/audio&gt;.&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;.var alarm = document.getelementbyid(""audio"");.//this basically sets the value of the audio to this variable..//so that i can do something like this.alarm.play();..alarm.pause();.&lt;/script&gt;...this method does not work, i have tried it already. but is there any other js wizardry that could emulate this?"
