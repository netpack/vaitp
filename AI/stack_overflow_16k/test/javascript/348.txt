"building blank calculator i am trying to build a calculator in blank but i am stuck and don't know how to proceed. every time someone click on 1 + 1 / 2, for exemple i am creating an array that pushes everything that was typed so in the case above the array would be ..[1, ""+"", 1, ""/"", 2];...however, i can't figure it out how to transform this array into an actual mathematical value..i had an idea of looping through all elements .like this:..for(var i=0; i&lt;arraycharacters.length ;i++){.            if(arraycharacters[i] != ""*"" || arraycharacters[i] != ""/"" || arraycharacters[i] != ""+"" || arraycharacters[i] != ""*""){.                arraynumbers.push(arraycharacters.slice(0, i));.                console.log(arraynumbers);.            }.        }...it's very incomplete because i got stuck. can anyone help me?"
