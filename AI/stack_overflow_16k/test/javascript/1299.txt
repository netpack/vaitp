"blank syntax? i'm not even sure of how to name what i want. so let me explain it by giving an example...while firefox uses textcontent, other browsers supports the innertext property. by the way, please correct me if i use wrong terminology. anyways, so far everything is ok. but i want something like the following: ..document.getelementbyid(id).itext = ""blablabla"" .//or.var x = document.getelementbyid(id).itext;.//where itext is something like:..if(e.innertext) return innertext;.else return textcontent;...i do not want to use a function for this stuff. also, please tell me the name of this ""thing"", if exists, as i am not familiar with it."
