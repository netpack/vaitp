"short circuit evaluation to undefined? i am using short circuit evaluation to set a key in an object. for example:..var obj = {foo : 'bar'}.var obj2 = {}..obj2.somekey = obj.baz || obj.foo //will assign 'bar' to obj2.somekey...the only difference with my code from that above, is that instead of assigning obj.foo if obj.baz doesn't exist, i would like obj.somekey to stay undefined. i tried obj2.somekey = obj.baz ||, but it threw me a syntax error. ..note that null and undefined, as this question suggests, are not actually undefined either. ..so is there any way i can do this with short circuit syntax?"
