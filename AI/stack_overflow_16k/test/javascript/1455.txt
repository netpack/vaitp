"is there a way to add contacts on a smartphone agenda through blank? someone knows if there’s a way to add contacts on smartphone agenda through blank? not like an ionic/cordova app, but from a regular website...i’ve made some research and get two matches: people api from mozilla (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/apps/fundamentals/gather_and_modify_data/updating_phone_contacts_from_the_web), not supported on the pther browsers yet, and the google people api...i just would like to know if there are other options for that."
