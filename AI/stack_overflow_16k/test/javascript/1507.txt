"using onchange for 3 linkeddrop down list menus i have 3 drop down lists and they are linked together:..category name, subcategory name, name. each one of them is retrieved from the database perfectly. the link between category and subcategory in the tables is category id and for the name between it and subcategory is the subcategory id...now, my question is that i need to know how to see the results based on the user selection by using the onchange blank...i tried to do that for static values and i got the concept, but how can i do that if i am retreiving the values from the db."
