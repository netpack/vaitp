"how to search for multiple variables within blank file and concat? here is my code;..function concatvar(data) {.    for (var data in window) {.        if (window[data]== data.match(data+(/[[0-9]+]/))).            return data;.    }.}..var data1 = [{ x: 290, y: 160}, {x: 391, y: 160}, {x: 391, y: 160}].var data2 = [{x: 200, y: 160}, {x: 193, y: 160}, {x: 421, y: 260}].var data3 = [{x: 200, y: 160}, {x: 193, y: 160}, {x: 421, y: 260}]..var data = data1.concat(data2, data3)..concatvar();...i would like to be able to search through a blank file and find any variable named data[+numbers] and then concat them into one variable. ..i'm struggling to find a way for this to be done? and i'm not sure if using a for loop within the window would be advisable?..any advice is much appreciated!..cheers"
