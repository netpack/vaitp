"how to get the compounded value from this blank code? i will be making a ci calculator, here is a compounded interest formula that i have obtained: total amount = p(1+(r/100))n..some details on each statement above:...  ci = compound interest,   p = principal or sum of amount,   r = % rate.  per annum,   n = time span in years,   total amount = p +.  ci...but i can't figure it out how to get the compounded value? ..it should output compounded value: 1691.13..var typ = 1;.var r = 6; // % rate per annum.var p = 5000; // principal or sum of amount.var n = 5; // time span in years..var result = math.pow(1 + ((r/typ)/100), typ * n);.var c = p * result; .var e = c; // output is 6691.13, compounded value: 1691.13..alert(e);...i expect the output to be 1691.13"
