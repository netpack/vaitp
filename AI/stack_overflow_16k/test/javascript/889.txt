"how to get variables out of closure? i have this class/service:..var user = (function () {.'use strict';..var user;..function set( user ) {.    user = user;.}..function getvotes() {.    return user.votes;.}..return {.    user     : user,.    set      : set,.    getvotes : getvotes.};..}());...i store the user like so: user.set( user );.but when i try and retrieve the user with user.user or get the users votes with user.getvotes() i get undefined. .why is that and is there a better way?"
