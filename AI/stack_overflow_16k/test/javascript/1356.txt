"object[index] - blank object error in ie - object doesn't support this property or method i have a simple script to retrieve an id from an object list in blank.  here is the example:..   var element_id;..    if (cur_index !== 0) {.        element_id = _big_list[cur_index-1];.    }...ie is throwing an error at:   _big_list[cur_index-1] ..error is object doesn't support this property or method.  this works fine in other browsers, and _big_list is definitely populated.  also cur_index is definitely within the _big_list object...any ideas?"
