"detect country and language of the user's location offline i'm trying to build an application in blank and i need to determine the country and the language of the user's location based on latitude/longitude...it's easy if i use a remote api as the google maps api, but how can i do it without it? just with the latitude and longitude?..var lat = 48.8534100;.var lng = 2.3488000;..// get the country from lat, lng..// then, get the language of the country...this application will be used in travel. that's why. then, get the visited country and its language."
