"inline blank vs external - is one more secure than the other? a question that i've wondered about every now and again over the years but never really bothered to find a definitive answer to...we know it's possible to manipulate both inline and external scripts via the console, but are there any small security benefits of one over the other?..is it a bit harder to manipulate one of them or are they both equally vulnerable?"
