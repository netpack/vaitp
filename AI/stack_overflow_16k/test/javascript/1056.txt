"how to extract wind speed and wind direction from windguru spot service? windguru offers a service of providing acurate wind speed and wind direction at certain sites of interest to windsurfres and kitesurfers, an example being ""http://www.windguruspot.cz/254"".  i would like to be able to extract these two variables automatically, perhaps using ""wget"" or a similar application, generating a local file containing their values...inspecting the source file at the above url it appears to me that it in turn accesses the url ""http://www.windguru.cz/js/pak/wgs.spot.min.js"" which provides for the values i am looking for.  however the source of the later blank file is so terribly, and probably also intentionally complicated that i cannot make anything of it."
