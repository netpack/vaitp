"i'm not a programmer. just need to know if dart is an alternative to java i am not a programmer and really did not know how much of the work i do online, relies on java..now that everyone has been asked to disable it- i have not been able to find any info,  on potential alternatives.  none of the articles sharing the information mention any alternative.  did google just not market this thing? i'm confused...can i just download dart and have it run instead of my java?**  and then be able to continue on business as usual?  or is it way more complicated than that?..ex- if my chrome stopped working. i would have other options to download, like firefox or ie and continue on with work...i just want to be able to use my computer like i do when java is enabled..is dart the type of software that will help me to do that?..any thoughts will be greatly appreciated!!!!!.thank you so much!.: )"
