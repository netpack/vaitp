"detect click outside div using blank i'd like to detect a click inside or outside a div area. the tricky part is that the div will contain other elements and if one of the elements inside the div is clicked, it should be considered a click inside, the same way if an element from outside the div is clicked, it should be considered an outside click...i've been researching a lot but all i could find were examples in jquery and i need pure blank...any suggestion will be appreciated."
