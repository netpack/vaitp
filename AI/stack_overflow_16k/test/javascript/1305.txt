"what's the last thing i typed in the console? if i'm in my browser's blank console, how can i programmatically get the last line i typed into the console?..i want to use this so that when i'm messing around with a dom interactively using the js console, i can have a savethat() function and if i like what i typed i can say..savethat(whatijusttyped);...let me try one more time:..in a pure blank repl environment, what expression will evaluate to the last console user input?"
