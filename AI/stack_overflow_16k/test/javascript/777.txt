"creating an array and a loop using blank with delays and actions i need help creating an array and a loop.  i am not sure how to include the two actions i need for both the mouseover and click for all 6 buttons i need to cycle through.  here is a sample of the code with the delays and two of the buttons.  the buttons have other area's where they are have actions to the mouse over and click so i am including both so the transition looks better...i am using the delay to slowly transition from one button to the next but am having difficulty to get it to loop...var delay1=5800//2 seconds.var delay2=6000//6 seconds..settimeout(function(){.  $(""#mc_button_hitid_2"").mouseover();.}, delay1)..settimeout(function(){.  $(""#mc_button_hitid_2"").click();.  //your code to be executed after 1 seconds.}, delay2)"
