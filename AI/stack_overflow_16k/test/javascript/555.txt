"simplest possible irrevocable timout / cooldown function? i'm trying to add a 1 second cooldown to my send-message system (as in, you can send 1 message per second max). so my initial thought was simply to create a timeout, and before attempting in sending to check if it exists still. that turned out to take more line of code than i anticipated initially...is there something i'm missing here? isn't there something as simple as:..//inside some message sending function.if(!mysupercooldown).{.    //send message.    mysupercooldown = cooldown(1000);.}...everything else i construct successfully ends up taking loads of lines, and it appears to me as something someone thought of before. thank you, and excuse my illiteracy."
