"js - how could i count each single element in array? i would like to know how many element of each number is in array, i. e.:.[2,2,3,6,1,1001,2] should return 2 => 3, 3 => 1, 6 = >1, 1 => 1, 1001 => 1. but when i use additional array when i set counted[2] = 3, and counted[1001] = 1 i create 1002 length array (in opposite to arrays in php i think...). how could i improve it? (of course i don't know how many element there will be in my input array).thanks in advice."
