"search blank array of objects i'm trying to filter an array of blank objects by a string. but i want the filter to look at every property and test it to see if the string is valid. angularjs has a built in filter that does this, but i can't find any solutions for it on so...[.    {.        ""title"":""mr."",.        ""name"":""john smith"",.        ""firstname"":""john"",.        ""lastname"":""smith"".    },.    {.        ""title"":""mr."",.        ""name"":""bill smith"",.        ""firstname"":""bill"",.        ""lastname"":""smith"".    }..]...so for example if i entered 'jo' for the text string it would bring back the object at index 0, which is pretty easy to do if you just want to search by a single property...now if i enter 'mr' it should bring back both items at index 0 and index 1 because we're searching all of the properties. ..hope this makes sense as to what i'm asking...edit: very sorry was a late night last night and i left off very significants details in the data structure...{.        ""title"":""mr."",.        ""name"":""john smith"",.        ""firstname"":""john"",.        ""lastname"":""smith"",.        ""contacttype"":{.            ""name"":""test"".        },.        ""addresses"":[.            {""address"":""test street one""},.            {""address"":""test street two""},.        ].    },.    {.        ""title"":""mr."",.        ""name"":""bill smith"",.        ""firstname"":""bill"",.        ""lastname"":""smith"",.        ""contacttype"":{.            ""name"":""test"".        },.        ""addresses"":[.            {""address"":""test street one""},.            {""address"":""test street two""},.        ].    }...so in this scenario the search would account for any type and any number of nested objects within objects. sorry for forgetting this part."
