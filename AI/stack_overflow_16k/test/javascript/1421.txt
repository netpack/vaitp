"selecting multiple rows of items in a table edit: i didn't have enough time to ask the question properly. i am rewriting the question with an image...so, i have a table (shown below):....the data on each row are dynamically filled out..however, if users want to delete the data (which they can), they have to delete them individually...how can i implement the ""select"" checkbox and apply the ""delete"" (for example) action to the ""checked"" items?..thanks! =)"
