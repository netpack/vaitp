"obtain value from json variable inside blank how to obtain value from json element being created dynamically. example below. i was wondering if there is way to get the value from previous element 'top' using some blank. (please update the title if its incorrect or misleading)..following this example on jsfiddle ..var info = [.{.  src: ""http://dummyimage.com/55x80/0d0.png/fff"",.  pos: {.    top: 93,.    left: 70.  },.  rotate: -10,.  zindex: 3.},.{.  src: ""http://dummyimage.com/55x80/d00.png/fff"",.  pos: {.    top: previouselement(top) + some dynamic value added at run time,.    left: 70.  },.  rotate: 0,. zindex: 2.},.]"
