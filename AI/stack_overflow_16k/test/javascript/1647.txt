"how to use a blank prompt box input value against a pre-defined object property name? i have to create a bill calculator for a cafe that takes the value of a prompt box (which also displays the various options on the menu &amp; adds the value of the object property (price) to a bill total..//drinks object  .var drinks = {  .    guinness: 40,  .    kilkenny: 46,  .    stellaartois: 28,  .    longislandicedtea: 35,  .    orangejuice: 19,    .};..//food object  .var food = {  .    toastedsandwich: 25,  .    cheeseburger: 55,  .    pizza: 75,  .    spaghettibolognese: 48,  .    rumpsteak: 150,  .};...is it possible to use an if else statement within the function to validate the users input in the prompt box against the food or drinks object property names only? and add that choices value to a total calculator?..eg.  ..var total = 0;..function displaymenu1() {  .    var inputdrink = prompt(""what drink would you like to order?, we have: "" + object.getownpropertynames(drinks));  .        if (inputdrink.value == drinks.guinness || drinks.kilkenny || drinks.stellaartois || drinks.longislandicedtea || drinks.orangejuice) {  .            alert(""great choice!"");  .    }else {  .        alert(""please choose a valid option from the menu"");   .    }  .}...i know the code is not complete, i am just curious as to how i can compare input against the object property names versus the property values."
