"how do i give a pointer to a new instantiation of an object? see the following piece of simplified code:..myvar= 1;.myfunc = function() {.    return { val : myvar };.};.myinstantiation = new myfunc();.console.log(myinstantiation ); //{val:1}.console.log(myvar); //1.myvar=2;.console.log(myinstantiation );//{val:1}.console.log(myvar); //2...is there any way i can declare the myinstantiation, or the myfunc so as to still do the same thing ( eg instantiate the object ) but in such a way that will allow me to change the myvar and have that change reflect inside the myinstantiation ?..eg i want the output to be ..console.log(myinstantiation );//{val:2}.console.log(myvar); //2"
