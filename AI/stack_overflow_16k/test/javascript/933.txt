"blank object not working in ie7 i have created the following blank object dynamically (from php):..var t_feed = '';.t_feed += '[';.t_feed += '{name: ""tom thumb"", thumbnail: ""images/tom_thumb.jpg"", link: ""http://twitter.com/cnnbrk/statuses/121630545879900161"", description: ""this is the body of the tweat""},';.t_feed += '{name: ""tom thumb"", thumbnail: ""images/tom_thumb.jpg"", link: ""http://twitter.com/cnnbrk/statuses/121622456363524097"", description: ""this is the body of the tweat""},';.t_feed += '{name: ""tom thumb"", thumbnail: ""images/tom_thumb.jpg"", link: ""http://twitter.com/cnnbrk/statuses/121614678341320706"", description: ""this is the body of the tweat""}';.t_feed += ']';.twitterfeeds[0] = eval(t_feed);...this works fine in ie8+, but i get the following error in ie7:...  script5007: unable to get value of the property 'thumbnail': object is.  null or undefined....i get this when i try and access the thumbnail property like this:..$.each(twitterfeeds[id], function(i,item){.    alert(item.thumbnail);.});...why does that fail in ie7 and is there a different way of defining a list or object that will work?"
