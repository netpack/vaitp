"how do i ""loop"" two functions without re-call in blank? i will be brief, let's take easy examples. i have these two functions:..function first() {.  alert(""function one"");.}..function second() {.  alert(""function two"");.}...i would like to pass from function first() to second() without doing this:..function first() {.  alert(""function one"");.  second();.}..function second() {.  alert(""function two"");.  first();.}...because i would create a stack overflow (like first() is calling second() inside of itself, then second() that is in first() and is calling first() again and so on, creating an endless loop that is unwanted)..how could i simply ""pass"" from a function to another? ask if you need more informations...thank you all."
