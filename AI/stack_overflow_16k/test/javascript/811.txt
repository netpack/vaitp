"checking a variable value using an or operator so, a junior programmer on my team today wrote the following piece of code:..if(status === (""incomplete"" || ""unknown""))...which is obviously not going to do what he intended, which was this:..if(status === ""incomplete"" || status === ""unknown""))...but what i can't explain is why exactly the first snippet of code wouldn't work! or why it evaluates to true if 'status' is set to 'incomplete' but to false when it's set to 'unknown'..."
