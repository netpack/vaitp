alternatives to adding dynamically generated inline blank generating inline blank in html has always made me feel dirty and after having used yui a bit i get the sense that it's best to leverage html elements as an alternative. would it be insane to use a hidden &lt;ul&gt; to store keys and values to be used by static blank which would only act when it found the &lt;ul&gt; rather than using inline blank?..what practices are common out there and what practices have the most merit with regards to avoiding inline blank?
