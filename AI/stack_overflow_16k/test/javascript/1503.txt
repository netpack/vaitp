"why dot notation failed in my property access? i'm learning from the book: blank the good parts. and i came across the following code augmenting function definitions.  ..function.prototype.method = function(name, func){.    this.prototype[name] = func;.    return this;.};...however, if i replace this.prototype[name] with this.prototype.name there is an error from firebug, and i was wondering where is the mistake? thank you for your help in advance."
