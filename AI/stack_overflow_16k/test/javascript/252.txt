"how to check dynamically-constructed variable names in blank i am console logging a string using a for loop and appending the for loop index number to each string. however, if the string matches the variable name roastaboutcheaplvl1 that i have defined, i want the variable content to be displayed instead...what i have tried so far:....var roastaboutcheaplvl1 = ""it works"";..for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {.  var num = [i].tostring();.  var a = ""roastaboutcheaplvl"" + num;.  console.log(a);.}.....what i expected:..it works   .roastaboutcheaplvl2  .roastaboutcheaplvl3  .roastaboutcheaplvl4   .roastaboutcheaplvl5.....what am i doing wrong in the above attempt?"
