"change class name on page scroll i am wanting to make a java script call that changes the class name of my navigation...my navigation is like this when the page first loads: ..&lt;nav class=""navbar navbar-inverse"" role=""navigation"" id=""topnav""&gt;...i want to change it to the following: ..&lt;nav class=""navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"" role=""navigation"" id=""topnav""&gt;...my blank is the following: ..$(window).scroll(function() {.   $('#topnav').classname('navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top');.});...i want this event to happen as soon as the page scrolls past the very top. if the page is scrolled back to the top i want it to go back to original. currently when i scroll, nothing happens."
