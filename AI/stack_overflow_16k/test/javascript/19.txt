"is there an efficient way to access an object in an array with its key? data = [.    {.       _id: 1234,.       name: 'ddd'.    },.]...let's say i have this object array in blank and i want to retrieve the object based on the _id. ..i know i can just do filter like,..data.filter((item, key) =&gt; { return item._id === ""1234"" })..but i wonder if there is a faster way of doing this, maybe like retrieving as i am accessing a dictionary with a key o(1)...any help?"
