"how does settimeout(console.log.bind(console, ""something"")) work? after reading how to hide source of log messages in console? , i'm confused about how this command works. ..i try to not use settimeout to wrap it, but the console log always show the source of log messages. even i try to see the stack trace, it just shows nothing like the second line:...what does the settimeout(console.log.bind(console, ""something"")) do?.and it seems cannnot remove settimeout? ..is there any other way to do the same thing?"
