"refresh web page exactly once without glitching i would like to use blank to refresh a web page exactly once. i have tried various codes on the web that are able to accomplish the task. however, i would like to refresh exactly once where no content is shown until the refresh occurs. this way; the user doesn't think a refresh happened, and it looks as if the site is taking a while to load. is this possible?..here is the code i am using. ..window.onload = function() {.if(!window.location.hash) {.    window.location = window.location + '#loaded';.    window.location.reload();.}.}...i am wondering if the page can reload just as it does, but nothing is made visible to the user until the reload is finished."
