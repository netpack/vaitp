"why isn't [1,2,3] equal to itself in blank? i was playing around with arrays in blank today and noticed this little gem:..alert([1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]); //alerts false...it strikes me as rather odd that the array is not equal to itself...but then i noticed this, which was even weirder:..alert([1, 2, 3] == ""1,2,3"");  //alerts true...?!?!?!?!!!?..why in the world is [1, 2, 3] not == to itself but is == to the string?..i realize that == is not the same as ===. even so, what evilness could cause mr. blank do such weird things?"
