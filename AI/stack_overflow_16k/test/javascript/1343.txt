"blank always round up to x decimal places i need to write a function that will always round up, but will either round up to 0, 1 or 2 decimal places, depending on if the function is passed a 0, 1 or 2...examples.....round to 0 decimal places:.13.4178 = 14..round to 1 decimal place:.13.4178 = 13.5..round to 2 decimal places:.13.4178 = 13.42..i've found math.ceil but this only rounds up to a whole integer and to fixed() will round up or down, not just up. is there a way to round up in the way i've described above?"
