"blank, what does immediately invoked function in this particular case?  (function(){.function byid(id) {.   return document.getelementbyid(id);.  }.  byid('submit').onclick = function() {.         ((more code here.....))..   };.})();...when i remove the function that wraps the rest of the code inside, then the script does not work. could any kind person explain to me what does that anonymous function at the top? why the script does not work without it?"
