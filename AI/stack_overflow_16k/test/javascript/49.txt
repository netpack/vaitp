"blank regular expression fails every other time it is called i am using the following blank to read strings out of a text file and process them with a regular expression..while (!textfile.atendofstream).{.    currline = textfile.readline();.    match = re.exec(currline);.    do stuff with match.}...the problem i have is that every other time re.exec is called it fails and returns null; so the first row is processed correctly, but the second row results in null, then the third row works, and the fourth row results in null...i can use the following code to get the result i want..while (!textfile.atendofstream).{.    currline = textfile.readline();.    match = re.exec(currline);.    if (match == null) match = re.exec(currline);.}...but that seems a bit of a nasty kludge. can anyone tell my why this happens and what i can do to fix it properly?"
