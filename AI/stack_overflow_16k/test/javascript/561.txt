"how to transform a matrix into array with one row consider a matrix b= [[6,4,1,2], [5,3,9,7],[1,3,2,1]];. b is a matrix with three rows and four columns. i want to treat it as an array or a vector, namely b1=[6,4,1,2,5,3,9,7,1,3,2,1]. moreover, i want to have, for instance, that b1[3]=2 - so it's a number, not a vector anymore. i wrote a simple function..function newarray(matrix){.var temp = [];.var w = matrix[0].length;.var h = matrix.length;.for (i=0; i&lt;w; i++){.    for (j=0; j&lt;h; j++){.        temp.push(matrix[i][j]);.        }.    }.    return temp;...}..it occours haowever, that it works only, when b is quadratic. what is wrong?"
