"opentok- how to prevent video from intruder? i am using opentok api to create a video chat app. in this app no more that two people should be able to connect to a session at a time...for that i am using sessionid to create room and token id that tells which room you want to connect...but as i am specifying this session id in blank, and any intruder can go and view the source of page and can get the session id and can misuse it...from my understanding if a person gets his hands on a session id it will be as easy as using opentok quickstart tutorial with my session id to snoop my video session...can this be prevented?"
