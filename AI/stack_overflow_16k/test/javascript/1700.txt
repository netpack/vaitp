"is there a simple way to understand .bind of blank in plain english? i have seen the docs.. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/blank/reference/global_objects/function/bind .but i just don't seem get .bind in pure vanilla blank as a concept.  ..can someone please explain.  i have seen code examples, but this topic i'm struggling to understand what it actually means...this question i do feel is different, because i want to understand it from a conceptual view point, not just code examples.  for example, if i had a garden object, and i added a function called make apples, it would generate 1 apple.  if i had a function called make oranges, it would return 1 orange.  what does bind mean, in a simple context please.  blank has been very difficult for me and my progress is slow and i'm struggling to get the bind concept."
