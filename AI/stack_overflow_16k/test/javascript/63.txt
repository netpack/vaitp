"closures - blank because callbacks behave as if they are actually placed inside a function, they are in practice closures: they can access the containing functionâ€™s variables and parameters, and even the variables from the global scope link. right? but if i do:..function fullname(firstname, lastname, callback){. var f_scope = ""x"";.  console.log(""my name is "" + firstname + "" "" + lastname);.  callback(lastname);.}..var greeting = function(ln){.  console.log('welcome mr. ' + ln);.  console.log(f_scope);//&lt;&lt;---error..};..fullname(""jackie"", ""chan"", greeting);...in other hand if greeting was inside of fullname the error will not happen. so callbacks are not 100% like if they are placed inside of a function? right?"
