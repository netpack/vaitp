how to run getelementsbyclassname on a node rather than the whole element i am curious to find out if there's an easy way to search for children of node x without actually having to loop through every child and their children and the children of the children and so on. something like x.getelementsbyclassname. is there such thing? i just want to point out that this is regarding pure natural blank without any libraries or frameworks.
