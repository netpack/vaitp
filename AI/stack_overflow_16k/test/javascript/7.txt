"why does having [].map with curly brackets change the way it works? so, basically i have this:..array.prototype.tostring = function() {.    return (""["" + this.map(thing =&gt; thing = '""' + thing + '""').join(', ') + ""]"").}...when i call it:..['foo', 'bar'].tostring()...it returns...  ""[""foo"", ""bar""]""...now, that would work perfectly. this one (with curly brackets) doesn't seem to work like i wanted it to:..array.prototype.tostring = function() {.    return (""["" + this.map(thing =&gt; {thing = '""' + thing + '""'}).join(', ') + ""]"").}...and it returns: ...  [, ]...so can someone tell me the difference? i don't know why [].map works like this."
