"js: find possible maximum and minimum of a variable the title might not be clear enough, but i'll try to explain it better here. i have the following code:..var $position, $difference;.$position   = parseint(($e.clientx - $this.offsetwidth) / $this.offsetwidth * 100);.$difference = ($this.offsetwidth / $position) * 100;...this is part of a function that runs when user clicks on a div ($this) and $difference outputs different values depends on screen width, for example:.3.341288782816229, 5.751848808545604, etc...i want to find out, if possible, the largest and the smallest possible numbers that i can get from this variable...how can i do this?"
