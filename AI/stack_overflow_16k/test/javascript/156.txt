"how does blank react to errors? i have been quite curious about how blank reacts to errors(like referenceerror, for example). when it encounters a runtime error, it seems to return from the function that it is called in which, in turn, fails the function it was called in...does it consequently fail all the functions in the frame stack? .(this is more of a question out of academic curiosity. hope somebody can explain it to me?)..thanks!"
