"reduce() to produce an object of objects i am trying to create an new object from another object using reduce()....const fontfamilymap = {.    sansserif: {.        fontfamily: 'arial, helvetica, sans-serif'.    },.    serif: {.        fontfamily: '""times new roman""'.    }.};..const test = object.keys(fontfamilymap).reduce((acc, cur) =&gt; {.    acc[cur] = {style: {fontfamily: fontfamilymap[cur].fontfamily}};.    return acc;.}, {});.console.log(test);.....this is almost working but the ouput is missing the inner object to the style object {fontfamily: fontfamilymap[cur].fontfamily} see codepen..the expected output should look something like this.....sansserif: {style: {fontfamily: 'arial, helvetica, sans-serif'}}"
