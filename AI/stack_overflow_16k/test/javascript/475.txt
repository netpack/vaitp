"is it good practice to manipulate a function parameter from within a function? is it generally acceptable (or frowned upon) in good blank practice to modify a function parameter of type reference value (object) from inside a function?..i’m aware of how it works in that all function parameters are passed by value and the reference value parameter is just a pointer to an object’s memory location...thank you!..edit: i've removed ""pass by reference"" from title and description to make wording more correct and to avoid confusion for readers. correct answer (and helpful comments) still apply"
