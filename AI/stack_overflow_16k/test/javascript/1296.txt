"is there a clever way to access a variable inside a wrapped function? var x=(function(){var u=1;})();..console.log(x.u); // undefined...is there any way at all to ether get, access or eventually console.log u?..is there any code i could put inside x that might make u vulnerable / accessable from the outside?..edit: i mean without returning u ""directly"". is there any way of accidentally exposing u?"
