"blank nesting switch statement i am new to blank and i am learning about switch statements. my code is trying to run two tiers of switch statements and validating data. my desired output would be to have the user input either a yes or a no and if yes is selected then it will go through the switch statement however if anything other than yes is selected then it will output ""too bad!"" to the console. i am having compiler errors and i am not sure how to fix this because i don't fully understand blank syntax to the fullest. ..var user = prompt(""welcome to learning about exceptions with me, a-rod. .in this tutorial we will be learning about exceptions and what not .to do with them. let's get started, shall we? "").touppercase(); ..switch(user){.    case 'yes'.     var user_1 = prompt(""what's your name?""); .     switch(user_1) {.        case 'buster':.            console.log(""hey, brother!"");.            break;.        case 'alex':.            console.log(""i've made a huge mistake."");.            break;.        case 'steve':.            console.log(""steve holt!"");.            break;.     default:.         console.log(""i don't know you!"");}.break; .default:.    console.log(""too bad!""); . }...the errors are...  ""expecting ':' instead of 'var' "" ...and ...  ""expecting '(end)' instead of 'default' """
