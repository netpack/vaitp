"blank form error i have my html structure in the following format..&lt;div&gt;.&lt;form class=""form-inline"" style=""padding-top:10px"" action=""blank:function()""&gt;   &lt;!-- a search bar--&gt;.  &lt;input id=""id"" type=""text"" "" placeholder=""something""&gt;.   &lt;/form&gt;..&lt;button onclick=""somefunction()""&gt; b&lt;/button&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;...the problem is i want the search bar to work when i press enter in it but unfortunately it is submitting the button element ,  i am slightly confused as the button is not a form element and i have specifically defined onclick. i am new to blank so i am sure it is something small but i have not been able to solve it...ie when i press enter , the  ""somefunction()"" gets active as opposed to ""function()"""
