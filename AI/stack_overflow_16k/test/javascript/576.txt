"when working with a form element how would you access what was input into the element to display a message? i have a form .&lt;form&gt;.  &lt;input id=""input"" type=""number""&gt;.  &lt;input type=""submit""&gt;.  &lt;/form&gt;. i want to be able to input a number into the number  and click the submit button and blank displays a number based on the number submitted.  ..(my guess is that this question is very basic but i am pretty knew to blank.)"
