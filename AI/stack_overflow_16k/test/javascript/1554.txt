"is encapsulating globals good blank practise? i'm new to blank, from what i'm reading global variables are bad practice since they pollute the global namespace. one of the.issues i'm constantly running into is variable scope. i read somewhere that one way to solve both issues is to create an empty object:..allvars = {}...and then to stick any variables i would otherwise set as global, as properties inside this object:..allvars.animal = 'bear';.allvars.sliderspeed = 1000;...so far this seems like a great idea to me, since now i can access my variables anywhere no matter the scope and also since all vars are inside this.object they are not global...so is there a downside to this way of doing things? is there a better way?"
