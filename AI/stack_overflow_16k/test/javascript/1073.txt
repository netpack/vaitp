"constructors and method chaining in blank i am trying to make method chaining work in conjunction with my constructors, but i am not exactly sure how to go about it.  here is my code thus far:..function points(one, two, three) {.this.one = one;.this.two = two;.this.three = three;.}..points.prototype = {..add: function() {.    return this.result = this.one + this.two + this.three;.},.multiply: function() {.    return this.result * 30;.}..}..var some = new points(1, 1, 1);.console.log(some.add().multiply());...i am trying to call the multiply method on the return value of the add method.  i know there is something obvious that i am not doing, but i am just not sure what it is...any thoughts?"
