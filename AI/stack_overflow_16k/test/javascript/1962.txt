"use float as array key i want to use an array to look up a value given a key. afaik, it should be possible when converting the float to a string, like the second example below: (jsfiddle)..arr = [];.arr[1.3] = ""one point three"";.console.log(arr.length);..arr = [];.arr[""1.3""] = ""one point three"";.console.log(arr.length);...but both result in a zero-length array. what am i doing wrong? i.e. how can i look up an object/string/whatever given a float value?..it would be awesome to have a reference guide on common operations when using having to look up values, such as:...get an element, given a float key.get total number of elements.test if float key exists.put new float key / value pair.and maybe others, such as loop through all keys/values"
