one line if/else in blank i have some logic that switches(with and else/if) true/false with on/off but i would like to make is more condensed and not use a switch statement.  ideally the if/else would be converted into something that is one short line. thank you!!!..var properties = {};.var isitmuted = scope.slideshow.ismuted();.if (isitmuted === true) {.    properties['value'] = 'on';.} else {.    properties['value'] = 'off';.}
