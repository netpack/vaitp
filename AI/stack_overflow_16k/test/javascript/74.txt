"can you mimic having blank disabled? a new requirement just came up at work, where the website i'm working on needs to work even if blank is disabled. ..unfortunitely, my place of work is so locked down that disabling blank has been disabled. in other words, i can not disable blank, it is always enabled even through developer tools. ..as far as i'm aware, ie9 is the only browser requirement. i'm unable to install any software or plugins due to lack of priviledges...the site was created with asp.net webforms in 2.0 and 3.5. however, i'm not asking how to solve asp.net issues related to blank being disabled...simply removing all blank will not produce the results i'm looking for...what i can do is use any blank libraries, though i'm not sure how that's helpful."
