"counting in binary i'm only learning to program and was trying to make a program to count in binary...i made a function that could convert the provided decimal to binary and it looks to be working just ok, but when i try to count upwards using a for loop my browser freezes and i can't understand why. using a similar while loop produces the result i needed...the problem is right at the bottom commented out. please help figure out what i'm doing wrong here...here's my code:..function isodd(num) {return num % 2};..var tobinary = function (number) {. ints = [];. binary = [];. ints.push(math.floor(number));.. while (number &gt;= 1) {.     number = (math.floor(number))/2;.     ints.push(math.floor(number));. }.. for (i=ints.length-1;i&gt;=0;i--) {.     if (isodd(ints[i])) {.         binary.push(1);.     } else {.         binary.push(0);.     }. }.. if (binary[0] === 0) {.     binary.splice(0,1);. }.. return binary;..};..var count = 0;.while (count &lt;= 50) {. console.log(tobinary(count));. count++;.}../*.for (i=1;i&lt;=50;i++) {. console.log(tobinary(i));.}.*/"
