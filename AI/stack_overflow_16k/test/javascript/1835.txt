why blank distinguish the assignment with or without declaration when delete? execute the code below in the global context:  ..var x = 1;.y = 1.delete x //false.delete y //true...both x and y is property of global object. why blank have to distinguish them in some extent?....it's easy to follow the routine accoring to es5 standard the delete operator and the the object internal method[[delete]]...the more clear question expressed is that why the different [[configurable]] attribute they adopt ?
