"why blank date object constructor doesn't work correctly? look at this code:..var date = new date();.console.log(date);.// tue apr 30 2013 14:24:49 gmt+0430..var date2 = new date(.    date.getfullyear(),.    date.getmonth(),.    date.getday(), 0, 0, 0, 0.).console.log(date2).// tue apr 02 2013 00:00:00 gmt+0430...i simply extracted some date from today's date, and created another date with that data, and the result is another date, not today. .what's wrong with blank's date object?"
