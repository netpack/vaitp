"js: updating a variable within an if statement and then using that variable in the statements condition? this has got me stumped. i'm creating a simple function that generates a random number between 1 and 6 when an element is clicked (a dice roll)...i want to use an if statement to do something if the number rolled is not a 1 or if the previous number rolled is not a 6, eg:..if(dice !== 1 || lastroll !== 6) { //do something..however, i cannot seem to get the or condition working here. both dice !== 1 and lastroll !== 6 work fine independantly, but when combined with the or condition in one if statement neither work...my complete function is as such:..var lastroll = 0;..document.queryselector('.btn-roll').addeventlistener('click', function() {..    var dice = math.floor(math.random() * 6) + 1;        .    console.log('current ' + dice + ' last ' + lastroll); //&lt;-- this displays expected results..   if(dice !== 1 || lastroll !== 6) {.     lastroll = dice;.     console.log('success');.   }.   else {.     lastroll = 0;.     console.log('fail');.   }.}...would anyone know why the or condition doesn't work?..update:..to test i did this:..var hardcoded = 6;.if(dice !== 1 || hardcoded !== 6) {...so i expect the condition to always fail. but it doesn't. it still doesn't like the if statement."
