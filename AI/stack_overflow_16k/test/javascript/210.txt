"dispatchevent not working in firefox i was trying to open a new tab inside my blank. it works as expected in chrome, but when it comes to firefox it does nothing.i know window.open() can be used to open a tab, but my intention is to keep the focus on the current page. i have spent my entire day searching for a fix for this, but all i could see is people claiming it is a bug in firefox. i wanted to know if there is any work around for this. here is the piece of code i am using...var a = document.createelement(""a"");.a.href = popup_url;//this comes from the function's argument.var evt = document.createevent(""mouseevents"");.evt.initmouseevent(""click"", true, true, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,.         true, false, false, false, 0, null);.a.dispatchevent(evt);"
