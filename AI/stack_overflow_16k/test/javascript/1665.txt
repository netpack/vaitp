"how to get reference to function in array if you know only the name of function? lets say i have array of functions such as [ function f1{}, function f2{}] and i know that the function i want to get a reference too is called ""f2"", so that i can remove it from the array, how would i go about it? i tried using the object that contains an array like ..ctrl.$parsers[""f2""] but it does not return anything. is this possible?"
