"searching values in array blank is there a built-in function in blank to do this or this is only the option to go? please look at the code below:..var arr=[1,3,4,'+','-', or whatever]..function value_check(user_click){..  var operators=['+','-','/','*','.'].  for (var i=0;i&lt;operators.length;i++){.    if (arr[arr.length-1]==operators[i]){var value1='operator found';}.    if (user_click==operators[i]){.     var value2= value1;alert(""consecutive operators""); break;.    }.  }.}...i think this code achieves what i intend to do but is there a simple and shorter way of doing this. in words, i want to achieve something like this:..if (arr[arr.length-1] &amp;&amp; user_click both are in operators array) .  alert(""consecutive operators)"
