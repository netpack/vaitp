"joining property values of objects in an array i have an array of objects. the objects have a property called username. is there a way to concatenate the username values into a comma delimited string? i assume i can use the join function but the only way i can think of takes two steps...var usernames: string[];.objectarr.foreach((o) =&gt; { usernames.push(o.username); });.var usernamesjoined = usernames.join("","");...is there a way to do it in one line of code?"
