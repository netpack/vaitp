"how to convert text to a function using blank i have a text string that is correctly formatted as a function and i would like to convert it to an actual function.  the text string looks like:..function object_123(){.   object_123_action();.   my_clicked(obj);.}...apart from the word ""function"" and {}; all other text is dynamically constructed. i.e. it may never contain object_123_action(), however, it will be something similar, basic function calls.  the only issue will be the obj will need to be the object that the function is assigned to...basically, i need:..this.func = eval(func_txt); //to actually work....where func_txt is:..function object_123(){.   object_123_action();.   my_clicked(this);.}"
