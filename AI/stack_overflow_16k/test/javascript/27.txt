"trouble accessing object within object code:..var items = {}; //object to store everything.var ilist = [.//a couple items to pull data from.];..ilist.foreach(function(ilist, index){.    var item = {.        quantity: //getquantity().text(),.        type: //gettype().text().    }.    items[""item""+index] = item;.});..console.dir(items); ...the console output for this shows:..object.    item0: object.        quantity: ""xx"".        type: ""xx"".    item1: object.        quantity: ""xx"".        type: ""xx""...so it looks like objects within an object and everything is already stored properly. then i try getting things out of it with console.log(items[0]), console.log(items.item0) and i get undefined in the console. console.log(items.item0.quantity) returns: uncaught typeerror: cannot read property 'quantity' of undefined. why am i not able to pull anything out of the object? i was hoping to turn this into a json object, but json.stringify(items); didn't work either."
