"google drive - how to move a specific file (.pdf) from a specific folder to another my english is a colander and my programming skills in blank the same. i have in a specific folder of google drive several pdf files (about 10). once a day, near midnight, i have to move these files separately (one for one) in specific google drive folders..actually i make this activity by hand, so i tried to automate it with a simple script...i'm able to point to the specific folder, but not to the specific file..in the samples i found around in internet all files contained in a folder are moved to another folder, so the filesiterator technique are used..but i don't need to iterate, i need to point the specific file and move it to anther folder...here my five (confused) program lines:..function movefiles(source_folder, dest_folder) {..var source_folder = driveapp.getfolderbyid('0b42jhhzp_5x7qulmde9szs0wmms');  .var dest_folder = driveapp.getfolderbyid('0b42jhhzp_5x7tfzbmxpfewpznfk');..var file = getfilesbyname('caa20170829.pdf');..// var files = source_folder.getfiles();.// logger.log(file.getas(mimetype.html).getdataasstring());..dest_folder.addfile(file);.source_folder.removefile(file);.}...the error message i'm getting: ...  referenceerror: ""getfilesbyname"" not defined. (line 6, file ""move"")...any help would be appreciated!....as suggested from max deepfield (thanks, max), i edited the line 6 as follows..var file = driveapp.getfilesbyname('caa20170829.pdf');...and the error message changed to...  impossible to find the method addfile(fileiterator). (line 11, file ""move"")...now i edited the 11. line as follows..driveapp.dest_folder.addfile(file);...and the error message changes another time......  typeerror: impossible to call the method ""addfile"" of undefined. (line 11, file ""move"")...thanks to hassan too, i am studying the examples he suggested..but if someone would give further help...   i thank in advance."
