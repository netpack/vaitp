"js - splitting a string and looping through results in js, i'm having trouble working out how to split a string coming from an ajax call...this is what i have so far:..xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function().{.if (xmlhttp.readystate==4 &amp;&amp; xmlhttp.status==200).{.feedupdateresponse = xmlhttp.responsetext;./////...split script.../////.}.}.xmlhttp.open(""get"",""https://mydomain.com/myscript.aspx"",true);.xmlhttp.send();...where you have /////...split script...///// in my script above, i need to add a little function that splits the string returned from my ajax call...the string simply contains names of divs, like this:..feedupdateresponse = ""div1/div2/div3/div4""...i would like to first split the string by its slashes (/) and run a loop through the different values and do stuff to those elements on my page...to give an idea of what i need to achieve, i have given this example which is a mix of asp &amp; js - it's the only way i can possibly describe it (and show that i've had an attempt) :)..myarray = split(feedupdateresponse,""/"").for each x in myarray.documentgetelementbyid('updateavailable_'+x).style.visibility=""visible"";.next...on my page i have an asp script that produces jquery carousels, all contained by separate divs. the divs are named div1, div2 etc. inside div1, for example, is a text element called updateavailable_div1 which will alert the user ""there are new photos available for this feed, please click the refresh button""...could somebody please explain to me how i can change my example above to work in js? just need to split the string into an array and loop through the split values..."
