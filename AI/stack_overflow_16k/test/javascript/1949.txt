is there a way to convert blank date object to string but retain the format as displayed when console.log is used on the date object? i want to convert the date object to string but i want it in the same format as it is displayed when i do console.log(new date()) which is something like '2019-05-21t11:55:39.496z' and not the usual extended format we get when we do console.log(new date().tostring()) which is something like this 'tue may 21 2019 17:28:51 gmt+0530 (india standard time)'.
