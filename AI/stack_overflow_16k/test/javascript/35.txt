"logic operators behavior in blank i'm currently learning blank (python background) and i'm having trouble on the logic behind stacking logic operators...let me explain...in python (61 &lt;= 81 &lt; 81) would output false. which makes sense since it's basically (61 &lt;= 81 and 81 &lt; 81)...but for some reason this same condition (61 &lt;= 81 &lt; 81) outputs true in blank, almost as if it is reading it as (61 &lt;= 81 or 81 &lt; 81) which is not expected. on the other hand if i explicitly write (61 &lt;= 81 &amp;&amp; 81 &lt; 81) the output is false as expected...could anyone explain?"
