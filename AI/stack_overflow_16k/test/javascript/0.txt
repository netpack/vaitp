"why is length equal to 0 in browser before it is defined? i would expect the value of an undefined variable in blank to behave like this when it is logged:....but on jsfiddle it is showing the length is 0 before it is ever defined.....after more research. it also seems to default to 0 in chrome.....when i would expect it to generate an error like with any other randomword....when i run the same commands in node locally, it seems to behave how i would expect. with throwing an error for length:....why is length equal to 0 in these cases?"
