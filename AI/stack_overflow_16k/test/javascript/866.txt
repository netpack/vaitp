"printing property values of a object in for loop i am a newcomer to blank and learning now..i am using for/in to print a properties and the value of each property of a object. .but i am able to print only the properties but not the property values...code snippet:..var obj = {x:1,y:2,z:3}.var disp_obj = function(obj){ for(p in obj) console.log(p, obj.p) }.disp_obj(obj)...and the output is:.x undefined .y undefined .z undefined ..as i can see from the output, only the property names are printed but not its values..please correct me what is wrong with this?"
