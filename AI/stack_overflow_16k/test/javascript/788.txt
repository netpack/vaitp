"blank not comparing properly i have a program written in js. it compares output of an function with number 4. however, it seems it cannot compare properly. ..var mystringnotvalidated =  ""3t-4t"";..var notvalidate = mystringnotvalidated.substring(3, 4);..if(notvalidate === 4).{.console.log(""value1"");.}.else.{.console.log(""null"");.}.//output is null, which ideally should be ""value1""...can any one guide me where am i making mistake?"
