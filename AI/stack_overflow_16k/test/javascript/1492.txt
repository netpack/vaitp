"blank foreach does not fully iterate over indices when remove an index i have an array of objects, which i am iterating over, and trying to remove a specific object from the list...running over the array i remove the first index and iterates only 2 times instead of 3 times...const data = [{.  id: 1,.  name: 'test1'.},.{.  id: 2,.  name: 'test2'.},.{.  id: 3,.  name: 'test1'.}]..data.foreach((item: any, index:any) =&gt; { .  if (item.name === 'test1') { .    data.splice(index, 1); // remove one record then and it stops early.  }.});...does anyone help me that iterate the fully if removed anything during the iteration?"
