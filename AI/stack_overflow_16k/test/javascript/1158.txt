"accessing variables by property name i know one can access global variables with a dynamic name by doing window['myvarname'] but the variables i am trying to access are not in the global scope. they are in the $(document).ready callback. is there a way to access these variables in a similar fashion?..example:..$(document).ready(function() {.  var addstuff,dropstuff;.  //....  ['add','drop'].foreach(function(adddrop){.    // do something to variable with name adddrop+'stuff'.  });.});...this is obviously a super simple example but it gets the point across of what i'm trying to do. there could be more than just 2 variables...what i've done so far to work around it is this:..$(document).ready(function() {.  var addstuff,dropstuff;.  var __vars = {'addstuff': addstuff, 'dropstuff': dropstuff};.  //....  ['add','drop'].foreach(function(adddrop){.    // do something to __vars[adddrop+'stuff'].  });.});"
