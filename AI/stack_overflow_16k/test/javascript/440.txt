"getting diagonal and vertical adjacent cells of a table in jquery i have a 4x4 table. i want to get to get adjacent that are vertical, and diagonal on the top on bottom. i don't have a problem getting them when the cell i click on is around the edges because i can use something like this...above = $(that).parent().prev().children().first().below = $(that).parent().prev().children().last().diagonalleft = $(that).parent().children().last().prev().diagonalright = $(that).parent().children().first().next()...but when i have one of these cases, when i can't use the first or last one, i don't know what to do. i can't figure out the logic for it."
