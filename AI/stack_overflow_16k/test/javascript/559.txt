"does the propery of the object is stored in its prototype? the mdn docs says https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/blank/inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain#inheriting_properties    ...  when trying to access a property of an object, the property will not.  only be sought on the object but on the prototype of the object, the.  prototype of the prototype, and so on until either a property with a.  matching name is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached....does this mean when a property is added to the object it is added to its prototype ?..ie. in the following code  ..a = {};.a.foo = ""hello"";...is actually stored as ..a.prototype.foo = ""hello"""
