"does || operator disable further concatenation? i've got some code like this:..a = ""string1"" + b || c + ""string2"";...and it's working as intended except string2 is left off the end when it's run...is there a way to make this work with parentheses perhaps? or maybe another method?..edit: the idea was for the code to concatenate string1, result of b || c, and string2 together."
