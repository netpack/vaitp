"high school level spanish 1 & 2 translator bug(made using labs.codeacademy.com) i am making a high school level spanish 1 &amp; 2 translator but i have run into a bug; after you are prompted for the word, instead of just giving you the translation it prints out the entire list of translations...i am using my basic java knowledge gained from the site codeacademy.com and can not figure out what causes this bug...p.s. if you can help me in making this process with the if statements easier and quicker i would greatly appreciate it...code:..var word = prompt(""word to translate(lower case only):"");..//english.var hi;.var white;..//translate.var hola = hi;.var blanco = white;..var translate = function(word).{.    return word;.};..//spanish to english.if(translate() === hola).{.    console.log(""hi"");.}..if(translate() === blanco).{.    console.log(""white"");.}..//english to spanish.if(translate() === hi).{.    console.log(""hola"");.}..if(translate() === white).{.    console.log(""blanco"");.}"
