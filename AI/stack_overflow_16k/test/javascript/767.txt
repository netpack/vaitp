"blank - keep date value in non-complete field i've looked everywhere with no result...i'm working on a little form that allows users to subscribe themselves on a site..there is a table with some cells and textnodes including also a 'date' field...with 'onfocus' event cells are colored in blue during editing..with 'onblur' event cells recover previous color, except if they include wrong value (e.g. numbers in 'name' field): in this case cells become red...i've some problem with 'date' field...i give example: user start to write birthday date and for some reason doesn't complete the field before change cell....or user after complete date field press esc..i both cases, if i try to read field value using getelementbyid().value, it returns '' (empty)...is there any way to read value in these cases?..thanks a lot."
