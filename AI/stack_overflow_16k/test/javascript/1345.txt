"preferable way to get map's value in blank as far as i know you can get map's value by key in two ways:..var mymap = {a: 1, b: 2}.var firstway = mymap.a.var secondway = mymap['a']...which way is preferable? is there a convection for this? should i avoid first way and could be there any problems i may find in the future (e.g  ie may not support it)? i understand that if i had some keys which require text escaping i won't be able to use .value on the map object, but what about simple cases?..my subjective point of view is that first way looks better."
