"declare variable in another scope look at this snipped code:..main = function() {.  alert('this is ' + t);.}..caller = function() {.  var t = 'me';.  main();.}..caller();...as you see, i wanna function main identify the value of variable t, but the browser appears this error: t is undefined...i can handle this error with change the scope of variable t to global scope or even pass the t variable to function main, but for some reason i don't want to use those and i want to declare variable t in scope of function main. is it possible or not? how can i handle this scenario?..thanks."
