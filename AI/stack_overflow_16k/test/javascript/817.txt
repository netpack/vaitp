"date.parse( ) provides different values depending on format (?) consider the following simple blank code example below. .i would expect same values for d and x, e.g. d-x = 0, but that does not seem to be the case? am i not allowed to use the date string format used for var x, or is there another reason? (i could not directly find such restriction in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/blank/reference/global_objects/date/parse, but also not an example with the string format yyyy-mm-dd)..var d = date.parse(""march 21, 2012""); ..alert(d); //val 1332284400000..var x = date.parse(""2012-03-21"");..alert(x);  //val 1332288000000..alert(d-x); //val -3600000"
