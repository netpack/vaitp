"input outside form are selected i have a little problem. i think i make a big noob mistake but i can't find it. in the following code i try to get input of my form, but it gets input outside of form too. why is that ?..here my js code :..function selectall(bool){.    var form = document.forms['selectmailing'];.    for(var i=1; i&lt;=form.length; i++) {.        form.elements['select'+i].checked = bool;.    }.}...and html :..&lt;input type=button value=""select all"" onclick=""selectall(true)""/&gt;.&lt;form method=post action="""" id=""selectmailing"" onsubmit=""return checkselect()""&gt;.    &lt;input type=checkbox name=""select1"" value=""1"" /&gt;.    &lt;input type=checkbox name=""select2"" value=""1"" /&gt;.    &lt;input type=submit value=""spammer"" /&gt;.&lt;/form&gt;...so when i try this, js return error 'cannot set property 'checked' of undefined' on line where there is my input button. why this stuff happens ? i select form and only his elements and input button has no name which can be confused with the name form...thanks for your help !..i know about jquery but i want to learn blank before, so if your only anwser is 'use jquery', please go help someone else :)"
