"getting user language from phone browser there are a lot of different ways to block a web-user user from seeing a page's contents based on location using the ip address...for my purposes i did not want to install anything server-side and decided to stick with blank...this script does well to render the contents of the page invisible -to the casual web user - if the system language is english (on all of the browsers i tried)...**the problem is that this script, using the navigator.language and navigator.userlanguage properties, do not work with mobile devices..mobile devices (iphone safari and opera mini) that use english do not return a value for navigator.language and navigator.userlanguage...is there anyway to get this information from mobile browsers?..(function(){ .var userlang = navigator.language || navigator.userlanguage; ..if(userlang === ""en-us""){ .var b00dy = document.getelementsbytagname(""body"")[0]; .b00dy.classname = ""display0""; .} ...})(); ...// adding the display0 class makes the body //invisible .// .display0 {display: none;}"
