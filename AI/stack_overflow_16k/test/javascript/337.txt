"dynamic html buttons in blank code so i am using blank, jquery, and html here. basically i have a dynamic number of buttons that are being created, and will each call a function using unique variables. the variables are held in a json variable. here is the code as it is:..    var box = ""&lt;font size=""2""&gt;the following assassins are in your current location:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table width = ""100%""&gt;"";..    for (var i=0; i&lt;info.length; i++) {.        if(userid != info[i].playerid){.            box += ""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;""+info[i].name+"" | rank: ""+info[i].rank+""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;input id='attack' type='button' onclick='loadattack(userid, info[i].playerid, info[i].name, info[i].rank, location)' value='attack'/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"";.        }    .    }.    box += ""&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/font&gt;"";..    $(""#assassinbox"").html(box);        ...the box looks fine, with the proper names, ranks, and buttons. the problem is when a button is pushed, info is undefined. i think this is because the button doesn't get its own copy of it, and is out of the bounds of the array at the end of the loop. i am struggling to think of a solution, some way of passing the onclick function a unique variable?..thanks!"
