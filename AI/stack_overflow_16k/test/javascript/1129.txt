"first letter capitalisation function also capitalising after apostrophe i have a function which capitalises the first letter of each word:..function format(str){.    str = str.replace(/b[a-z]/g, function(letter) {.        return letter.touppercase();.    });.    return str;.}...it is also capitalising after an apostrophe:..console.log(format(""mark"")); //mark (correct).console.log(format(""mark o'loughlan"")); //mark o'loughlan (correct).console.log(format(""mark's audi"")); //mark's audi (incorect)...ideally, i'd like it to capitalise after an apostrophe if it's a name (example 2), but not for 's (example 3).  how can i fix this? fiddle here..edit: i don't think this is a duplicate of this question, as i'm specifically asking about not capitalising 's but after other apostrophe's is ok."
