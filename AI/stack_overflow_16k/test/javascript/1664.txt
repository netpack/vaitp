"reduce an array of objects and sum property for each distinct object i am not sure for what functions i should look at to achieve what i am trying to do. probably reduce is not correct...a database query returns a list of objects like this one:..result = [{group1: 'a', group2: 'a', sum: 5},.           {group1: 'a', group2: 'b', sum: 2},.           {group1: 'c', groupe2: 'b', sum: 3}.         ]...i want to ""reduce"" or ""group"" this array to obtain an object for each distinct group1 and group2 values and the sum relative of it like this object below:..wanted = [{group1: 'a', group1_sum: 7, group2: 'a', group2_sum: 5},.          {group1: 'b', group1_sum: 0, group2: 'b', group2_sum: 5},.          {group1: 'c', group1_sum: 3, group2: 'c', group2_sum: 0}.         ]...or could also be:..wanted = [{groupname: 'a', group1_sum: 7, group2_sum: 5},.          {groupname: 'b', group1_sum: 0, group2_sum: 5},.          {groupname: 'c', group1_sum: 3, group2_sum: 0}.         ]"
