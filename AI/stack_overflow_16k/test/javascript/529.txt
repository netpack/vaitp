"accessing eval'd code through setinterval/settimeout i am wondering if i can do some cleanup routines that will auto grab timeouts / intervals. consider this:..var timeout = setinterval(function dimitar() {.    console.log(""hi!"");.}, 1000);..console.log(window);...i had a look through window and can't find any reference to the function that's been passed on. the reference to timeout is there, sure enough. so where does the function 'live' here? is it launching a new instance of the js interpreter to eval/run/keep the code? how can you access it in relation to the timeout uid?..i know i can curry the setinterval function and get it to always store the reference into an array which i can then loop through and clear, but am curious if there's a natural way of doing this"
