"is this an object? is this an object: [ [ 5, 'yes' ], [ 8, 'no' ] ] ?..there is a code that looks like this..myfunction( [ [ 5,'yes' ], [ 8 , 'no'] ] );..but i want to append values to the data inside the function param programmatically...in other words, i want to call something like this instead:.. var d = new object();. var d = addvalue(5,'yes');. var d = addvalue(8,'no');. ..... myfunction(d);...is this right? would i use an object here?.if so, how do i append individual values to the object?"
