"how do i pass multiple parameters to a function in blank when one of them is a function? i have a function which i'm passing the results of another function into:..mysite.get_products(mysite.get_product_ids(wishlists));  ...however, i find when i try passing another parameter to it as below, the first parameter is not being passed through (console logging as 'undefined'): ..mysite.get_products(mysite.get_product_ids(wishlists), 0);...is there anything wrong with my syntax?"
