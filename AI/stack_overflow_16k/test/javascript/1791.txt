"how to most efficiently generate an array based on collapsed values in an array of objects? assume you have lista, and a defined array of ""columns"":..var lista = [{.    name: ""mike"",.    exercisedateandtime: 1299233593000,.    exercise: ""jumping jacks"",.    numsets: 5.}, {.    name: ""charles"",.    exercisedateandtime: 1299233593000,.    exercise: ""swimming"",.    numsets: 2.}, {.    name: ""charles"",.    exercisedateandtime: 1299233593000,.    exercise: ""swimming"",.    numsets: 6.}, {.    name: ""mike"",.    exercisedateandtime: 1299237012000,.    exercise: ""running"",.    numsets: 5.}, {.    name: ""william"",.    exercisedateandtime: 1299237320000,.    exercise: ""fishing"",.    numsets: 2.}, {.    name: ""william"",.    exercisedateandtime: 1299237611000,.    exercise: ""motor boating"",.    numsets: 6.}, {.    name: ""charles"",.    exercisedateandtime: 1299237611000,.    exercise: ""swimming"",.    numsets: 4.}];..var columns = [""exercise date"", ""mike"", ""charles"", ""william""]...the goal is to generate a single array from list a such that any times that happen to match up will be ""collapsed"". in this case, the output should be:..var output = [[1299233593000, 5, 2, null].[1299237012000, 6, null, null].[1299237012000, 6, null, 0].[1299237320000, null, null, 2].[1299237320000, null, null, 2].[1299237611000, null, 4, 6]]...notice how when one or more people have the same time ""1299233593000"", the ""output"" accounts for it and ""collapses"" them into a single array. null values show up for the exercisedatetimes where an individual did not have any ""numsets"". the values that are not null are those where the individual has ""numsets"" for that time...what is the best way to get to ""output"" using blank while allowing variable names (say fred was thrown in with his information into lista) and variable columns (assuming you could remove ""william"" from the ""columns"" array and it would not show up in the output)...ideal solution would be best performance in speed and processing required."
