"blank cant reset object in module const player = (name, mark) =&gt; {.    let markedspots = [];..    const markspot = (spot) =&gt; {.        markedspots.push(spot); .    };..    const clearspots = () =&gt; {.        markedspots = [];.    };  ..    return {name, mark, markedspots, markspot, clearspots};.};..let player1 = player('player 1', 'x');.let player2 = player('player 2', 'o');..const gamelogic = (() =&gt; {.    let currentplayer = player1;..    const reset = () =&gt; {..        player1.clearspots();.        player2.clearspots();.        currentplayer = player1;.    };..    return {startgame, reset};.})();...above i have part of the code from a tictactoe game that i am trying to make. in the reset function i need to clear the array in the both player objects and set the current player back to player1. through debugging, i know that calling the clearspots() function does clear the array in the player objects. but there is a problem with reseting the currentplayer. i believe this might be a closure problem, but i have no idea how to identify the problem or how to solve it. can anyone explain to me?"
