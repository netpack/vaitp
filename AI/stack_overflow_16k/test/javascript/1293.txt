"frameworks for blank ui widgets? i'm trying to put together a list of blank ui widget frameworks for consideration in a project. ideally it would be a library that has a range of ready made ui widgets, no dependencies on dom/js extention/manipulation frameworks like jquery or prototype, minimal additional cruft, such as ajax api's and dom selectors etc...here's what i have so far:...qooxdoo, .scriptclient.extjs...could anyone suggest any other that are worth a look?..please do not suggest, jquery, prototype, mootools, dojo etc, their primary focus is not to provide ui widgets."
