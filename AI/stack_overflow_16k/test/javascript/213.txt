"save a specific boundingclientrect? i'm using getboundingclientrect to change an elements position to absolute without changing it's position:..   style.position = 'absolute'.   style.top = container.getboundingclientrect().top.   style.left = container.getboundingclientrect().left.   style.width = container.offsetwidth...i do this to later transition the element to fullscreen, like this:..  style.top = 0.  style.left = 0.  style.width = '100%'.  style.height = '100%'.  style.transitionproperty = 'top, left, width, height'.  style.transitionduration = '.2s'...style is a blank object that gets converted to css-properties...later on i want to close the full-screen-thing and revert the element back to it's original size. i would like to save the values from getboundingclientrect as they are at the first transition. can this be done?"
