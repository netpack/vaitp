"should a variable commonly evaluated as true in the ""if"" or the ""else""? if i have a variable from a dataset that evaluates as true most of the time should i put it in the ""if"" clause or the ""else"" clause. is one faster that the other? i am sure it depends on things like the blank engine and/or the operating system as it is coverted to machine language...like this:..var usualytrue;.// some more code here....if(usualtrue).    //do something.else.    //do something else...or like this:..var usualytrue;.// some more code here....if(!usualtrue).    //do something.else.    //do something else"
