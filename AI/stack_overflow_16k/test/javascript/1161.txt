"prevent browser from opening context menu i have a element which is initially hidden by css. ..&lt;span class=""error-span""&gt;some text&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;button id=""button""&gt;zoom&lt;/button&gt;...and i have a blank function which will show me the text as long as a button is pressed. when i move away from the button the text is hidden again...this is fine, however on safari on iphone the event opens the menu after a while (where you can search, copy etc.)..is there any way to prevent this?..blank:..$('#button').on('touchstart mouseenter',  function (e) {.        $( "".error-span"" ).show();.    });..    $('#button').on('mouseleave touchmove click', function (e) {.        $( "".error-span"" ).hide();.        request.    });...edit: using oncontextmenu=""return false;"" however, when i keep pressing the button longer than a few seconds, then it seems that it freezes (because it gets selected) and i can only hide the element by clicking somewhere..i have also tried using an img and span instead of the button and this..html,body{.    -webkit-touch-callout: none;.    -webkit-user-select: none;.    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);.    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;.}...without success."
