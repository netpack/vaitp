"windows 8 metro inapp purchases for dummies am ready to deploy my second windows 8 metro style blank app and i would love to include in app purchases..i tried implementing it with the following code i got from here.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694067.aspx..function appinit().{.  // some app initialization functions..    // get current product object .    // execute only one of these statements. .    // the next line is commented out for testing..    // currentapp = windows.applicationmodel.store.currentapp;..    // the next line is commented out for production/release..    currentapp = windows.applicationmodel.store.currentappsimulator;..    // we should have either a real or a simulated currentproduct object here...    // get the license info.    licenseinformation = currentapp.licenseinformation;..  // other app initializations function. }. function buyfeature1() {.    if (!licenseinformation.productlicenses.lookup(""featurename"").isactive).      {..        currentapp.requestproductpurchaseasync(""featurename"", false).then(.           function () {.            // the in-app purchase was successful.            }, .           function () {.            // the in-app purchase was not completed because // there was an error..        });.    } .    else.    {.    // the customer already owns this feature..    }.   }...but nothing seems to happen.i know this is a novice question. but i'l be glad if someone can provide a full simple working solution.btw i've read the docs and downloaded the sample.i also have my storeproxy.xml file setup."
