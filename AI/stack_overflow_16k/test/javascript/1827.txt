"indexof with 2 parameters i currently have this code that returns me the index where it matches on personid.  it works just fine...however i need to expand it some.  my object also includes jobid.  i need this to look for personid and jobid.  is there a way to do this with indexof or do i need to loop through my object to find the correct element?..pos = eventobjs.map(function (e) { return e.familymemberpersonid; }).indexof($(element).attr('familymemberpersonid'));...lets say i have an object with 2 properties:.personid and jobid..[0].personid: 1, jobid: 1.[1].personid: 2, jobid: 1.[2].personid: 1, jobid: 2.[3].personid: 2, jobid: 2...i want to return index [1] if i know it is personid: 2 and jobid: 1"
