"blank: could not really understand the function return it is maybe incredibly easy but i couldn't solve what was going on....function dosomething(a).{.   var num=10;.   return settimeout(.   function(){ a(num); }, 1000);.}...the only thing that actually confuses me is the a(num) part. what actually it does?reminder:  i really am asking because i'm not familiar with the blank syntax."
