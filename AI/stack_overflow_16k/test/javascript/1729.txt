"blank converting string to number only if the string is an number how can i convert string to a number if i don't know if the string value is a valid number or not. i want to leave the string as is if it is not valid...example..""0"" -&gt; 0.""0.5"" -&gt; 0.5.""100"" -&gt; 100.""abc"" -&gt; ""abc"" //  remains a string."" "" -&gt; "" "" // remains an empty string.""-1"" -&gt; -1 // i'd like to convert negative numbers too...i've tried..var str = "" "";.var num = +str // num = 0.var num = number(str) // num = 0.var num = parseint(str) // num = nan...so seems my problem is with space. i was thinking of using parseint but i thought that it might be a bad idea to use nan as a value in blank and just leaving the string as is would be better."
