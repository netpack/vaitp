"function reference and ""inline"" function declaration i have a scenario where i can pass a function or have it declared already. since the function itself is not going to be used anywhere else i was planning to use an anonymous function instead, but the thing it's not working, so any help will be greatly appreciated...as it is right now:..function connectstatic(connect, dir) {.  return connect.static(require('path').resolve(dir));.}..// ....middleware: function (connect) {.  return [proxysnippet, connectstatic(connect, './')];.}.// ......as i would like it to be:..// ....middleware: function (connect) {.  return [proxysnippet, function () {.    return connect.static(require('path').resolve('./'));.  }];.// ......anyway, if i do:..// ....middleware: function (connect) {.  return [proxysnippet, connect.static(require('path').resolve('./'))];.// .........it will works, but i'm wondering why it doesn't with the function declaration."
