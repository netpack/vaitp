"i felt confused about the scope of the varible in blank i am practicing blank, so i wrote:.. function f(){ .      console.log(this);      .      var b=2;  .      console.log(b);   .      this.b++;     .      console.log(b);   .      b++; .} .f();.console.log(b);...the result surprised me:../*the console result*/.window.2.2.nan...in my opinion, this points to f();. b is a private variable for f();. this.b++ and b++ operate on the same variable.../*the right anwser in my mind*/.f.2.4.typeerror...please explain why i did not get the expected result."
