"why my reverse array function's output is as same as input? i want to write a reverse array function and i met the problem. the compiler said my input and my output is the same...why did this happen?..requirement:..do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with o(1) extra memory...example1:...  input: [""h"",""e"",""l"",""l"",""o""].  output: [""o"",""l"",""l"",""e"",""h""]...example2:...  input: [""h"",""a"",""n"",""n"",""a"",""h""].  output: [""h"",""a"",""n"",""n"",""a"",""h""]...here is my js:...  var reversestring = function(str) {.    var nowarray = [];.    nowarray.push(str);.    var newarray = [];.    for(let i=nowarray.length-1, k=0; i&gt;=0; i--, k++) {.      newarray[k] = nowarray[nowarray.length-1];.      nowarray.length--;.    }.    console.log(newarray);.  };..reversestring( [""h"",""e"",""l"",""l"",""o""]) // should return[""o"",""l"",""l"",""e"",""h""]"
