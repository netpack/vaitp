"'this' is assigned to a var before being used? i often see blank code where this is assigned to a variable to be used to refer to the current instance of the object...var me = this;.me.someproperty_or_method...why are they coding like that? ? here is a more complete code snippet,..var preload = function(game){};..preload.prototype = {..  init: function() {.    var me = this;..    var style = {.      font: ""32px arial"",.      fill: ""ffffff"",.      align: ""center"".    };....this.text = this.add.text(me.game.world.centerx, me.game.world.centery, ""loading: 0%"", style);.    this.text.anchor.x = 0.5;.  }..  preload: function(){ .    this.game.load.text('dictionary', 'assets/dictionary.txt');..  },..  create: function(){.    this.game.state.start(""main"");.  }.}...i'm pretty sure this not a duplicate, the answers given on other posts are not definitive."
