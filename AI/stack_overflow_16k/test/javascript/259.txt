"can't increase by 0.1 with `tofixed(1)` in blank i'm trying to create two methods: one for increasing the number by 0.1 and another one for decreasing by the same value. but i met an unexpected behavior for me: i can decrease the number properly using number = (number - 0.1).tofixed(1);, but when i'm trying to increase the number the same way (it works only once), i've got the error:...  ""uncaught typeerror: (number + 0.1).tofixed is not a function""...here is the code:....var number = 0.5;.console.log('number: ', number)..function increase() {.  if (number &lt; 1) {.    number = (number + 0.1).tofixed(1);.    console.log('number: ', number).  }.}..function decrease() {.  if (number &gt; 0) {.    number = (number - 0.1).tofixed(1);.    console.log('number: ', number).  }.}.&lt;button onclick=""increase()""&gt;increase&lt;/button&gt;.&lt;button onclick=""decrease()""&gt;decrease&lt;/button&gt;.....my question is: why? and how should i correct my code, to repair my increase method?..thanks in advance"
