"defining string() class from scratch i got this exercise from a book (without solution): ...  imagine the string() constructor didn't exist. create a constructor function.  mystring() that acts like string() as closely as possible. you're not.  allowed to use any built-in string methods or properties, and remember that.  string() doesn't exist. you can use this code to test your constructor:..&gt;&gt;&gt; var s = new mystring('hello');.&gt;&gt;&gt; s.length;....yet, i have a solution but not sure i followed the requirement (that is: ""i am not allowed to use any built-in string methods or properties"");.and here's my solution: ..function mystring(string) {.    this.length = 0;.    for(var i in string) { .        this.length++;      .    }.}.var x = new mystring(""hello"");.x.length;...the one that i am not sure about is the for-in loop. could you tell me what is the data type of string variable in that loop? is that kind of array or am i using it as string (that is i did break the requirement)?.thanks a lot!"
