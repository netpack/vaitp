"blank - how to add multiple objects into an empty array i am trying to add multiple objects- company names into listbox companies. i used $scope.companies.push(newcompany[0].name); to add the company into the list. but only the first object's company gets added because i used newcompany[0].name. ..now, how do i add the second company name into the list without entering newcpmpany[1].name ? say there are 50 companies, i cannot add all 50 by doing this. is there a better way to add all the names in one go? like a loop or incrementing the element or something? looking for some help. thanks in advance.....var newcompany = [{.            name: ""huawei"", // --&gt;company name.            email: ""drath@yahoo.com"",.            phone: ""123-123-1234"",.            owner: ""drath"",.            street: ""gin blvd"",.            city: ""austin"",.            country: ""usa"",.            duns:""123112321"",.            type: ""buyer"".        },.        {.            name: ""asus"", // --&gt;company name.            email: ""vadar@yahoo.com"",.            phone: ""999-123-8888"",.            owner: ""vadar"",.            street: ""vince blvd"",.            city: ""dallas"",.            country: ""usa"",.            duns: ""123100000"",.            type: ""supplier"".        }];.        .        window.localstorage.setitem(""newcompany"", json.stringify(newcompany));.......$scope.companies = [];.    var newcompany = json.parse(localstorage.getitem(""newcompany""));.    $scope.companies.push(newcompany[0].name);"
