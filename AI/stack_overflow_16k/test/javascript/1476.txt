"how to get a return true out of happy number algorithm? the goal of this algorithm is to take the square of each digit of a number, add them together, and then keep repeating until the number 1 is returned. i've determined the algorithm works, however, i cannot get true to return. why isn't this working?....const n = 19;..const sumsquare = (n) =&gt; {.  const n = n.tostring();.  let sum  =  0;.  for (let digit of n) {.      const product = +digit * +digit;.      sum += product;.  }  .  console.log(sum);.  if (sum === 1) {.    return true;.  } else {.    sumsquare(sum);.  }.};..console.log(sumsquare(n));"
