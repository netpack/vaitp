"fill array in a for loop i'm trying to fill a new array within a loop, but i can't figure it out...what i need is, that i filter all value's from my temporary array to set to my new array..all value's that start with ""+"" need to get into the array ""my_hash_plus"". .this is what i have now...var my_hash_plus = new array;   .$.each(my_hash_plus_tmp, function(_, temp) {.    if (tmp[0] == ""+"") {.        my_hash_plus[] = temp;.    }.});...i noticed that i can't fill my array with [] in js, but if i those things then my_hash_plus becomes a normal var... so my question is: what is the best way to get all the value's from the array my_hash_plus_tmp that start with ""+"" into a new array (which i will call my_hash_plus)"
