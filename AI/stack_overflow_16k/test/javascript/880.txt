"'let' vs 'var' in blank for loops, does it mean that all the for loops using the 'var i =0' should actually be 'let i =0' instead? since according to what&#39;s the difference between using &quot;let&quot; and &quot;var&quot; to declare a variable?, the let keyword has a smaller scope than var when used in a for loop. does this mean that of all the places where 'for (var i=0...' the actual correct way should be to use let? i can't imagine a case where a developer who was using 'for (var i=0...' would want to have the var i still be visible outside the for loop, meaning that all 'for (var i=0...' are wrong and the correct way is 'for (let i=0...'? just a yes or no question...function allyilliterate() {.    //tuce is *not* visible out here..    for( let tuce = 0; tuce &lt; 5; tuce++ ) {.        //tuce is only visible in here (and in the for() parentheses).    };..    //tuce is *not* visible out here.};..function bye40() {.    //nish *is* visible out here..    for( var nish = 0; nish &lt; 5; nish++ ) {.        //nish is visible to the whole function.    };..    //nish *is* visible out here.};"
