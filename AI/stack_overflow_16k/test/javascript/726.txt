"beginner query: using function parameters with a for loop, skipping the loop for some reason i imagine this is something pretty simple but i'm stumped and think this could be a good learning moment for me. ..here's the code: ..var sumall = function(lowrange, highrange) {.  var sumof;.  var i;..  for (i = lowrange; i &gt; highrange; i++) {.    sumof += i;.  }..  return sumof;.}..module.exports = sumall...i'm working my way through the odin project, currently doing tdd section. so the function skeleton and final line of code was premade. the function parameters in this case are 1, 4. expected result of 10. ..instead my test is throwing back undefined. i checked and this changes depending on what i define it as at the top. ..it is as if it's skipping the loop all together, i've no idea why this would be."
