"add time to blank clock i want to be able to add a specified time to a blank clock and have it keep updating. i have managed to chuck the below together. ..    function leadtimer(leadtime) .    {.      var d1 = new date (),.      d2 = new date ( d1 );.      d2.setminutes ( d1.getminutes() + leadtime );.      currenthours = d2.gethours();.      currentmins = d2.getminutes();.      // choose either ""am"" or ""pm"" as appropriate.      var timeofday = ( currenthours &lt; 12 ) ? ""am"" : ""pm"";.      // convert the hours component to 12-hour format if needed.      currenthours = ( currenthours &gt; 12 ) ? currenthours - 12 : currenthours;.      // convert an hours component of ""0"" to ""12"".      currenthours = ( currenthours == 0 ) ? 12 : currenthours;.      if (currentmins&lt;=9) { currentmins=""0""+currentmins; }.      if (currenthours&lt;10) { currenthours=""0""+currenthours; }.      $(""#result"").empty();.      $(""#result"").html(currenthours + "":"" + currentmins + "" "" + timeofday).      setinterval('leadtimer(leadtime)',10000).}...i figured that the setinterval would just use the current value for leadtime but i just get an error saying leadtime is undefined.  ..ultimately i would like to be able to call on this to keep a clock ticking over depending on what the user selects."
