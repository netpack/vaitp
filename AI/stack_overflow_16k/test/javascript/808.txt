"why does sorting a js array of numbers with < work? when sorting an array of numbers in blank, i accidentally used &lt; instead of the usual - -- but it still works. i wonder why?..example:..var a  = [1,3,2,4].a.sort(function(n1, n2){.    return n1&lt;n2.}).// result is correct: [4,3,2,1]...and an example array for which this does not work (thanks for nicolas's example):..[1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]"
