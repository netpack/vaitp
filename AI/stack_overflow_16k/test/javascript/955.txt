"remove everything before the last occurrence of a character i'm trying to perform the following action on a string : ...find the last occurrence of the character ""/"";.remove everything before that character;.return the remains of the string;...to be more explicit, let's say i have the following string :..var string = ""/roland/index.php""; // which is a result of window.location.pathname...now what i need to extract out of it is everything but the actual page, something like this :..var result = ""index.php"" // which is what i need to be returned...of course, that is just an example, because obviously i will have different pages, but the same principles apply...i was wondering if someone could help me out with a solution for it. i tried the next actions but with no success :..var location = window.location.pathname;.var result = location.substring(location.lastindexof[""/""]);"
