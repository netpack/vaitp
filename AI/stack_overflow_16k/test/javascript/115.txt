"blank - can i run my event handler after the default handler for the ""onkeypress"" event? i have an input text and i want to run my function after the default event handler..&lt;input type=""text"" onkeypress=""myfunction()""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;...the function..function myfunction(){alert($(""input"")[0].value)}...because myfunction() is using the input value and this property will be changed after the default handler runs and change it..example: if the text field has value ""1234"" , and i pressed the key ""5"", the function will alert ""1234"" not ""12345""..so, i want the default function runs first to change the value property , then i can use it in myfunction()..can i do something like this ?!.. onkeypress=""default();myfunction()""...i did a work around by putting myfunction() in the onkeyup event, but i don't want that...thanks, and please consider i'm very newbie."
