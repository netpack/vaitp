incorrect variable when calling callback in js i am getting the wrong filename in the following code. i'm sure its obvious what the mistake is but i dont see it. i get the correct amount of errors however all the filename are the same rather then the filename in error...for(var i=0; i&lt;this.files.length; ++i){.    var f = this.files[i];.    var reader = new filereader();.    reader.onload = function(e) {.        if(e.total&gt;maxfilesize){.            toobigfilesls.push(f.name);
