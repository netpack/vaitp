"why logs say that ""cannot read property push of undefined"" i have a presentation in a bit and i think i will break my laptop...i had this perfectly working code, and without changing anything i get this message...here is the piece of code where i get the error.. var array = [];.    for (let i = 0; i &lt; customerdetails.length; i++){.            array[i].push(customerdetails[i].name);.    }...btw customerdetails is an array of objects ie [{}, {}, {}]..how the heck is the array not defined? initially i had the array definition in another place (outside the function so it was working fine and i moved it right in there just to test)...either i am too tired and can't see it or there is another issue that actually results to it? the error itself does not make sense to me...edit:.i put the answer from below here, there should be no array[i].push but instead array.push.although i did not change that, i should still see it..thanks to this community for helping, you are really great!"
