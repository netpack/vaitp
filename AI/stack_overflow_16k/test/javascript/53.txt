"html element - property of document object ? or an object? so,  html elements such as &lt;title&gt;are sometimes referred as property,  but sometimes they are referred as objects. i am kinda confused.  are html elements properties of document object? or are they objects? or are they both at the same time?  thanks.       to make question meet quality standards i will add some random codes. ..&lt;!doctype html&gt;.&lt;html&gt;.&lt;head&gt;.&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;.&lt;/head&gt;.&lt;body&gt;..&lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;"
