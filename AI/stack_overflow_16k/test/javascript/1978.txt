"significance of blank:void(0) returning ""undefined"" i have more than a few doubts regarding blank:void(0)..the following are my doubts....i know it returns ""undefined"" but what is the significance of it. or in other words, at what sitiation or circumstance do we use blank:void(0); what exactly does the programmer want when he uses blank:void(0).i'm asking this question because i dont have a clear understanding of blank:void(0) and it might be stupid. but what would happen if i use blank:myfunction(""some argument"") instead..like for example &lt;a href=""blank:myfunction(""args"")""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;...please focus more on the second part."
