"copy button preserving line breaks i have some very basic blank that copies text upon the push of a button. my problem is that it doesnt preserve line breaks:..&lt;script&gt;.function copytoclipboard(element) {.  var $temp = $(""&lt;input&gt;"");.  $(""body"").append($temp);.  $temp.val($(element).text()).select();.  document.execcommand(""copy"");.  $temp.remove();.}.&lt;/script&gt;...i'd really like something to be able to be added to the above script to avoid making huge changes on the site already. ..i've seen things on other posts such as:..post.innerhtml = post.innerhtml.replace(/n/g, '&lt;br&gt;n');...which in theory would work (i think) but i suck at blank. ..any suggestions?..thanks"
