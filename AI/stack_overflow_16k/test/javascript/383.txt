"object.defineproperty is letting me enumerate prototyped properties but object.keys doesn't include that property, what gives? is it possible for the snippet below to get object.keys to include the prototyped properties (e.g. health)?..note: i need the health property defined after the definition of the class.....class player {.  constructor(level) {.    this.level = level;.  }.}..const player = new player(10);..object.defineproperty(player.prototype, ""health"", {.  enumerable: true,.  get: function() {.    return this.level * 15;.  }.});..console.log(player.health);..console.log(object.keys(player)); // not showing health..for (let prop in player) {.  console.log(prop);.}.....if not, how would i go about adding a property to the player class that has the health property so that i can get the two properties from any created objects?"
