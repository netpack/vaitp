"creating tables in blank i have a problem. i'm studying blank but i have no idea how to create tables working only on blank files. i have to create a table for each output of letter frequency but i have no idea how to do it. here is the output i should have to have:....at the beginning i thought to work on the html but i can't as that part is related to test my code has to pass. here i will show some of them:..display_letter_frequency(letter_frequency(""hello""),document.getelementbyid(""frequency_table""));.    var rows = document.getelementbyid(""frequency_table"").queryselectorall('tr').    equal(rows.length, 4, ""with input string 'hello' there should be 4 table rows"").    equal(rows[0].queryselectorall('td')[0].innerhtml, 'h', ""1st td of 1st tr should have the value h"");.    equal(rows[0].queryselectorall('td')[1].innerhtml, '1', ""2nd td of 1st tr should have the value 1"");.    equal(rows[1].queryselectorall('td')[0].innerhtml, 'e', ""1st td of 2nd tr should have the value e"");.    equal(rows[1].queryselectorall('td')[1].innerhtml, '1', ""2nd td of 2nd tr should have the value 1"");.    equal(rows[2].queryselectorall('td')[0].innerhtml, 'l', ""1st td of 3rd tr should have the value l"");.    equal(rows[2].queryselectorall('td')[1].innerhtml, '2', ""2nd td of 3rd tr should have the value 2"");.    equal(rows[3].queryselectorall('td')[0].innerhtml, 'o', ""1st td of 4th tr should have the value o"");.    equal(rows[3].queryselectorall('td')[1].innerhtml, '1', ""2nd td of 4th tr should have the value 1"");...also i cannot use the console.log but write just the code of the function that will be called back by the tester. here is what i did but i don't know if it's right and how to go forward:..function display_letter_frequency(a,dom) {.if(a === undefined){.    return undefined.} else {.    var tbl     = document.createelement(""table"");.    var tblbody = document.createelement(""tbody"");.    for(var x in a){.        var row = document.createelement(""tr"");..        }.    }.}...this code is related to a function i wrote before which count in command line the frequency letters of the user:..function letter_frequency(s) {.if(s === undefined){.    return undefined.} else {.    var freq = {};.    for (var i = 0; i &lt; s.length; i++) {.        var character = s.charat(i).touppercase();.        if (freq[character]) {.            freq[character]++;.        } else {.            freq[character] = 1;.        }.    }.}.    return freq;.}...hope that the problem is clear and you can help me and the people who will need it. i looked around the web and they talks about some frequency table to define my problem. i don't know if t's right"
