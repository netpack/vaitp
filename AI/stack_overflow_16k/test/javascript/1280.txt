"why does one of these calculations return nan when the others work as expected? ..var fir=prompt(""enter first number"");.var sec=prompt(""enter second number"");.var sum=number(fir)+number(sec);.alert(""the sum is "" + sum);.alert(""the difference is "" + fir-sec);.alert(""the product is "" + fir*sec);.alert(""the division is "" + fir/sec);.....now: suppose fir=2 and sec=1...the output is:..3.nan.2.2...why is the difference nan instead of 1?"
