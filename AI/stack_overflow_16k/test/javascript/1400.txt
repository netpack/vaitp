"blank object multiple sorting ..arrayobject = [{..0: {label: ""117"", objects: array(1), tostring: ƒ, status: 1}.1: {label: ""118"", objects: array(1), tostring: ƒ, status: 1}.2: {label: ""156"", objects: array(1), tostring: ƒ, status: 1}.3: {label: ""164"", objects: array(1), tostring: ƒ, status: 1}.4: {label: ""asterisk"", objects: array(1), tostring: ƒ, status: 1}..].....i have been trying that i would like to sort multiple values like firstly * value should comes first index and secondly it should work as normal sorting. is there any way to make it work...here the actual scenario,..arrayobject { ..label: ""text1"",.label: ""text2"",.label: ""123"",.label: ""*""..}...expected like ..arrayobject { ..    label: ""*"",.    label: ""123"",.    label: ""text1"",.    label: ""text2"".. }...i have tried this,..arrayobject.sort(function(x,y){return x == ""asterisk"" ? -1 : y == ""asterisk"" ? 1 : 0;});...it works great but in other places normal sorting is not working properly"
