"is there a way to change the name of a function i'm using a pattern from :.giulio canti's blog so that i can create lots of constructors. i wish there was a way of setting the function name.  that is, given the constructor..function struct(cls, props) {.  function struct(obj) {.    // add properties.    for (var name in props) {.      if (props.hasownproperty(name)) {.        // here you could implement type checking exploiting props[name].        this[name] = obj[name];.      }.    }.  }.  // the following doesn't work for me!.  // struct.name = cls;.  return struct;.}...when i use it to create an instance, e.g...  var person = struct('person', {.  name: string,.  surname: string.});..var person = new person({surname: 'canti', name: 'giulio'});...in the console i get the following:....but i would prefer:..person {name: ""giulio"", surname: ""canti""}...any suggestions on how i could accomplish that?"
