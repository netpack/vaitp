"how to save an object to a database as json string and reload later? so i have a module object, and i have a advmodule object which inherits from module using the following:..function object(o) {.    function f() { }.    f.prototype = o;.    return new f();.}.function inheritprototype(subtype, supertype) {.    var prototype = object(supertype.prototype);.    prototype.constructor = subtype;.    subtype.prototype = prototype;.}..inheritprototype(advmodule, module);...module has a object variable called 'settings' which contains things such as x, y, height, width, etc. currently i am saving those settings to a database in json format. then when the page is refreshed those settings are pulled from the database to recreate that module. ..but now i have advmodule as well, and there isn't anything currently in the settings that indicate what kind of object it is supposed to be. i know that i can just assign a string value and use that in a switch statement to decide what objects get built using those settings, but i would like to avoid the switch statement as the number of objects inheriting from module is volatile and i don't want other developers to have to go in and continuously change the switch statement. i want the settings to know what object is to be built...i have tried adding another value to 'settings' that is the name of the object: i.e -> {type:advmodule} and i use this when loading like so-> item = new settings.type(); which seems to work..but when i go to save this to my database json.stringify seems to throw it out or ignore it. ..any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks"
