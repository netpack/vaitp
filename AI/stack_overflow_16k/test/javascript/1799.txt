"change div scale on scroll i am trying to reduce the scale of a div to .7 as well as the opacity to .5 when the user scrolls down on a site...i have found a few examples of this question on here but none that apply 2 effects and many that do not have successful answers...the name of the main div which contains the background image is ...home-hero-effect .background-wrapper (i am using visual composer)..i tried the below code as a starting point but it made no change at all and i am unsure how to add the opacity effect to it...the origin being here .shrink both height and width of a div by scrolling?..var divtochange = $('.home-hero-effect.background-wrapper');.var lastscroll = 0;.$(document).scroll(function(event){.    var st = $(this).scrolltop();.    if (st &gt; lastscroll){.        var divheight = divtochange.height();.        var divwidth = divtochange.width();.        divheight-=5;.        divwidth-=5;.        divtochange.css({'width':divwidth, 'height':divheight});.    } .    else {.        var divheight = divtochange.height();.        var divwidth = divtochange.width();.        divheight+=5;.        divwidth+=5;.        divtochange.css({'width':divwidth, 'height':divheight});.    }.    lastscroll = st;.});"
