how functions create new functions in blank? in the eloquent blank book i came across this code..i understood how this works and the passing of arguments but what i am unable to understand is author's statement regarding this code that it's a function which can create another function! ..my question is: how is it creating a new function? what is happening which the author is calling creation of a new function? i mean sure we are creating a function called greaterthan and it has another function in it but i can't see how greaterthan is creating another function!..i assure you i have read many similar qs before asking but couldn't find the answer i am looking for. thank you for your time &amp; help...function greaterthan(n) {.  return function(m) {.    return m &gt; n;.  };.}.var greaterthan10 = greaterthan(10);.console.log(greaterthan10(11));.// â†’ true
