"blank - declare variables with a for loop i'm just wondering if it's possible to declare multiple variables using a for loop in blank. ..example: i have 4 &lt;article&gt; elements whose ids are article1 article2 article3 and article4. instead of declaring each variable independently, i'd like to do it in a loop (as they use essentially the same code and i don't want to repeat myself!). ..something like:..window.ready = function(){.    for (var i=1; i&lt;=4; i++){..            var article[i] = document.getelementbyid(""article"" + i);..        }.}...the above returns an error with an unexpected [, so my syntax must be off (i'm very new to js), but (a) is this on the right track and (b) will these be global variables if i run them in a window.ready function?"
