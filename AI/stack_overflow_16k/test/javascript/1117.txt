"check if point is inside circle i have a gps coordinate of a spot called spotcoordinates and a center the a circle coordinates this.state.center and a radius in kilometers this.state.radius..i'm trying to make a method to check if the spotcoordinates is inside a circle but i don't know how i can add the radius to the coordinates and how to check if it's actually inside or not. it would be easier if it was a square... calculateparkingspotsinthearea = () =&gt; {.      this.state.parkingspots.map(spot =&gt; {.          let spotcoordinates = spot.coordinates;.          console.log(spotcoordinates, this.state.center, this.state.radius);.          // calculate if the parking spot is inside the circle.      });.  }...e.g values printed in the console spotcoordinates = [41.5408446218337, -8.612296123028727] center = {lat: 41.536558, lng: -8.627487} radius = 25....any help?"
