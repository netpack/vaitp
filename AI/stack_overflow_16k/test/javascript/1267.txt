"using blank to resize browser window in ie8. explanation mostly i have seen many examples on using blank to resize a browser window, but for me they all fail to perform that function in ie.  i include my code to see if anything is wrong with it that i just don't see.  the code works great in ff but that is not used at my location...i am no blank expert, but i am no slouch either.  if i were new to blank i would be hating it.  i'm sure it has something to do with ie but i cannot explain it...any help would be great...code:..  //window.sizetocontent();.  window.resizeto(700, 700);...i read in the docs that sizetocontent will not work in ie but resize should.  it is an incredibly simple statement."
