"access a window by window name if i open a window using ..window.open('myurl.html', 'windowname', 'width=100,height=100');...how do i refer to the new window (from the same page that opened it) using 'windowname'?  this question is specifically about this.  i'm aware that i could save a reference to the handle by using ""var mywin = window.open(...)"" but i don't care about that in this situation...thanks, - dave"
