"how to make a blank class with methods and an array i can push to? i want to define a blank object which manages messages. within this object, i'll need an array that i can do a push() to:..msgobjcollection.push(msgobj)...essentially i am trying to fill the msgobjcollection object with a bunch of msgobjs. each msgobj has the 3 variables messagestext, timestamp, source (sent or received)...also, i'll need to have some methods like:..msgobjcollection.sent.count       // counts the number of sent messages.msgobjcollection.received.count   // counts the number of received messages.msgobjcollection.count            // counts the total number of messages in the object...i'm not sure how to approach this in the simplest, cleanest manner...note: in case there's any confusion, these are not static methods. i'll be creating instances of these objects using the new operator. so i will need multiple instances."
