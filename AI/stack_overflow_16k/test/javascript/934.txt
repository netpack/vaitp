"getting the next key in a set of keys (circular) in a blank object consider the following:..var obj = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4, e:5, f:6};...note that this is not an array (unless it is in js and there is a way to map them)..i now have a requirement to get the next key, given a key. it also needs to be 'circular'. so findnext('c') should be d, while findnext('f') should be a..here is what i came up with:....var obj = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4, e:5, f:6};.console.log ( findnext('e',obj), "" is after e"" );.console.log ( findnext('f',obj), "" is after f"" );.console.log ( findnext('a',obj), "" is after a"" );....function findnext (key,obj).{.   var size = object.keys(obj).length;.   var i;.   for (i=0; i&lt;size; i++).   {.      if (object.keys(obj)[i] == key).      break;.   }.   i = (i + 1) % size;.   return object.keys(obj)[i];.   .}.....is there a better way to do this, given that all keys are a hash? can i avoid not having to iterate till x to find next(x) ?..thanks"
