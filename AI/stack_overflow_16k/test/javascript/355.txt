"how to know when to use document.body i have a simple scroll function which allows me to smooth scroll to an element with an id...when i call the function i set a boundary, which is usually the &lt;body&gt; tag...example call:  ..scrolltopos(document.body, howfar, 200);...the problem is that some browsers use document.body and others use document.documentelement..is there a way i can know which to use without doing a mass browser checking?..i'm using blank, but not jquery"
