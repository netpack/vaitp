"removing content in parentheses at the end of a string with blank i wonder if anyone can suggest a way of stripping the parentheses (and their content inside) and the preceding space from a blank string?..i'm using an itunes xml feed and a lot of the movie titles have the year included, or ""extended edition"" etc...i'd like to strip these out and just have a nice clean movie title...here are a couple of examples of what the string looks like now:..midnight special (2016)..friday (1995)..and what i'd like it to look like after the trim...midnight special..friday..the length of the string could vary, otherwise i'd do a trim to a certain length. many thanks in advance..simon"
