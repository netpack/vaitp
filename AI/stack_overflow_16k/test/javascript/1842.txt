"finding the index to a non-specified character let's say for example i have a string..thisisthistuesday day...i want to find the index of all the capital letters, test if there is a space before it, and if not insert one.  i would need the index of each one. .at least from what i can see indexof(string) will only produce the index of the first occurance of the character t/t ..this : ..for(i=0;i&lt;str.length;i++){.  let char=str[i];..  if(isnan(char*1)&amp;&amp;char==char.touppercase()){.    y=str.indexof(char);.    console.log(char,y).  }.}...would produce the capital letters, and their indexes but will only display the first occurrence of the character in question. i feel pretty confident that the part i am missing is a for() loop in order to move the index iteration..but it escapes me. ..thank you in advance!"
