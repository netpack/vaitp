"'this' not working as expected in event i'm trying to create a custom module. i'm using prototype to add additional methods. the module will have an event, in which i will have to access a method from the module with this. the problem is, when i use this from the events function, this is something else. it isn't the module...how can i access the modules methods in the events function? (or if there's a better way to do what i'm trying to do, then please let me know.)..jsfiddle....function myplugin() {.  this.hello = 'hello'.  document.addeventlistener('click', this.clicked);.}..myplugin.prototype.clicked = function(e) {.  console.log(this.hello);.}..myplugin.prototype.somemethod = function() {.  console.log(this.hello + ' somemethod');.};..var plugin1 = new myplugin();"
