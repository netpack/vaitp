"onload doesn't fire on ""new image()"", when src is "".js"" file am i wrong in assuming, that this should work?..var i = new image();.i.onload = function () {.    alert('foo');.};.i.src = 'http://whatever.com/script.js';...this way onload event doesn't fire at all..if i replace the last line with..i.src = 'http://somethingelse.com/image.png'...then it does. what could be the problem here? does it only fire on image sources? what are the allowed content types then? can't find any info on that."
