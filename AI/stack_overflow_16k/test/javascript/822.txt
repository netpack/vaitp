"how can i improve this vowel counter function for higher efficiency? this code works, but i was wondering if it was possible to receive some advice on how to make this function run faster...i have used regular expressions as well as the match method because they seem straightforward to me...const vowelcount = str =&gt; {.  let vowels = /[aeiou]/gi;.  let result = str.match(vowels);.  let count = result.length;..  console.log(count);.};...the function will display the number of vowels inside a string."
