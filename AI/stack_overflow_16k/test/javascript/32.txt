purpose of this blank prototype snippet sorry i can't phrase this better. but i ran across some code like the following:..myobject.prototype = object.create(myobject.prototype);.myobject.prototype.constructor = myobject;...and i just can't seem to figure out what it does. myobject is defined above it something like this:..function myobject(options) {.    this.someprop = somedefault;.    this.otherprop = process(options.something);.    // etc....}...and it's always called as a constructor. i'm just wondering what benefit those first two lines provide and if it's a known pattern in blank.
