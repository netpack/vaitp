"what's the purpose (if any) of ""blank:"" in event handler tags? i've been making a concerted effort to improve my blank skills lately by reading as much blank code as i can. in doing this i've sometimes seen the blank: prefix appended to the front of event handler attributes in html element tags. what's the purpose of this prefix? basically, is there any appreciable difference between:..onchange=""blank: myfunction(this)""...and..onchange=""myfunction(this)""...?"
