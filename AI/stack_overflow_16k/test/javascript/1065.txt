"number starts with zero in blank,don't want for octal converstion in blank if the number starts with 0 it's getting converted as octal during manipulation...for example:..var mobilenumber = 01000;// collecting from user input...then value of the mobilenumber is 512 during manipulation...we have a custom class for mobile number processing, i should pass '01000' to that accessor method...kindly suggest us solution for it."
