"why doesn't blank warn me when i use arr.lenght (misspelt) instead of arr.length in a loop? i also use strict mode i spent hours just to find out that i misspelt the word .length as .lenght. it can run normally with no warning at all. why...?..i use 'use strict' and run on node.js 10.13.0...code:....'use strict';.let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];.for(let i = 0; i &lt; arr.lenght; i++) {.  console.log(arr[i]);.}"
