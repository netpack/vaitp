"when and when not to use 'return' keyword in a funciton? i have learned in ""function section"" of the blank course in codecademy that: to call a function, we have to use 'return' keyword inside the function. but in the ""array section"" of the blank course found a function can be called without using 'return' keyword inside that function. can anyone explain when i must use 'return' keyword inside the function and when it is optional?.i am attaching the code snippet for your reference. ..const flowers = ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold'];..function addflower(arr) {.  arr.push('lily');.}..addflower(flowers);"
