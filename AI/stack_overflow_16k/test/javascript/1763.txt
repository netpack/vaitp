"blank game level inheritance i'm rewriting a game i've designed in flash/as3.0 to blank and am having trouble wrapping my head around prototypes, having learned classes. i've read a ton of info about it and am still not quite sure how i apply it to this scenario...so... in my as3.0 project i had a level class, which had the guts of what happens in all levels of the game, the enter_frame functionality etc. then i extended that class with each level, for level specific details such as item placement, terrain details etc... so my question is how is the most efficient and 'proper' way to do this...right now i have the two functions:..function level() {.//generic level functionality.}..function level1() {.//level1 specific functionality.}...then as i've read i should i have set..level1.prototype = new level();...but i have found this executes everything within the level function at runtime, which i don't want. ideally i'd like a start button to instantiate level1, and level1 to have the properties and methods of level - and, if possible, execute everything within level1's and level's constructor when this happens... is it possible?..i'm sure it's obvious but i can't seem to click, sorry if i'm asking a silly question..much appreciation to any help in advance."
