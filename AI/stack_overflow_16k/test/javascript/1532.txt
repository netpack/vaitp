"js fails to copy a <textarea> selection i've created a page with a text box, and want to include a typical 'copy text' button. the button selects the right text but somehow fails to copy anything. instead the firefox console reports ...  ns_error_failure: component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (ns_error_failure) [nsidomhtmldocument.execcommand]...if you look at the source code the key areas are lines:..189: document.execcommand('copy');  .194: &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=""button"" value=""copy script"" onclick=""copyfield('rscript');""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.195: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;textarea id=""rscript"" rows=""20"" cols=""150""&gt;...anyone know why this is happening? thanks in advance."
