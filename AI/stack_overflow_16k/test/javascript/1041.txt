"blank for array rotation trying to understand how the code below always brings up a number between 0-6..var dayinmili = 86400000;.var weekinmili = 604800000;.//datetime() returns miliseconds since thurs, jan 1 1970, need to account for week starting monday not thursday..while (currenttime.getday() != 1){.  currenttime.settime(currenttime.gettime() - dayinmili);.}.//we need to find the number of weeks since the beginning of the year so we can.//  use that to determine schedule rotation.var weeks = math.floor(currenttime.gettime() / weekinmili );.var startpoint = weeks % 7;"
