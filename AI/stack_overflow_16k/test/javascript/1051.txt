"confusion with how asynchronous callbacks work in js i am new to js and was trying to get how asynchronous callbacks work and how to properly use them but faced some confusion. so, as far as i understood asynchronous callback is executed only after the other code finished executing, that is, if we send request to server and we do not know when the data will be obtained then we need to use asynchronous callback which ensures that callback function is executed only after we get data. but what confuses me is that why we use asynchronous in front of callback since asynchronous is what is run via event loop but callback awaits until other code finishes and asynchronous callback is not run via event loop right?"
