""feedbackid"":32,.      ""sender"":""12345"".      ""comment"":""test comment"",.      ""replies"":[ .         { .            ""feedbacklogid"":32,.            ""feedbackreplylogid"":1,.            ""comments"":""so this is 1"",.            ""createdby"":""jack"",.         },.         { .            ""feedbacklogid"":32,.            ""feedbackreplylogid"":2,.            ""comments"":""2nd one"",.            ""createdby"":""min"",.         }.      ],.   }.]...this is what i've done. i am only able to get 1 as the length...let repliestorender = data.map((item) =&gt; {item.replies}).let numreplies = repliestorender.length"
