"how do i alter a canvas' width or height? i have a simple script which selects all canvases in my document. i want to loop through them and adjust their width and height...i was hoping someone could explain how i can access the properties of the canvas so i can change them. i tested it with this:..var d = document.getelementsbytagname('canvas');.for (var i=0, max=d.length; i &lt; max; i++) {.  console.log(d[i].style.width); // blank.}...the problem is, my console.log shows blank lines, so i'm a bit confused. i hope you can explain where i am going wrong here."
