"non-blank pop-up for non-blank users? i was wondering if it's possible at all to do something like the following:..let the website examine whether a visitor has blank enabled or not. if not a pop-up will appear telling them to enable blank for a better website view...it doesn't have to be a pop-up, it could be anything, really...is it even possible to do something like that without using blank?..in the worst case scenario i just leave a plain text note in my footer or so."
