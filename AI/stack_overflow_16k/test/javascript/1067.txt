"find the last visited url in blank with history i know about document.referer and this is not what i'm looking for..it could probably be a solution but i want to retrieve it in local without using server...steps :...i'm pushing a new state in the current url of my page with history.pushstate('','','#test').i'm going to the next page..and now i want to retrieve the url but history.previous has been erased since gecko 26....is there an other way of getting this value except from using cookies or sessionstorage?"
