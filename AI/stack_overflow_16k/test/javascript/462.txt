"how to compare a user entered date to the current date and change a fields background color? i am new to blank and am working on a fallible pdf form and trying to set it to do multiple things. the first is i need to compare a user entered date to the current date to see if it is withing 5 years to the day. the second thing i need it to do is to change a fields background color if that date is at the 5 year time or outside of that range. this is the code i have been trying but it hasn't worked so far. there are 37 fields that need to be checked by this. ..for(i=1;i&lt;38;i++){..var y = d.getfullyear(); .var d = new date();.var m = d.getmonth(); ..var d = new date();.var d = d.getday(); //n =2..var strdate = this.getfield(""text""+[i]).value;.var arrdate = strdate.split('/');..var month = arrdate[0];.var day = arrdate[1];.var year = arrdate[2];..if(year+5&gt;=y){.if(m&lt;=month){.if(d&lt;=day){.this.getfield(""text[i]"").fillcolor=color.red;.}}}}"
