"blank: shortest code to find object key matching a pattern consider the object:..var myobj = {.  hugekey1: 'xxx',.  hugekey2: 'xxx',.  hugekey3: 'xxx',.  hugekey4: 'xxx',.  prettykey1: 'only one'.};...following is the code for getting a list of all keys with pattern hugekey:..var filteredkeyset = _.filter(.    object.keys(data),.    function (key) {.        if (key.match(/hugekey/i)) {.            return true;.        }.    }.);...there is only one key named prettykey1, but this the number at the end is dynamic - it could be prettykey2 as well...what's the shortest piece of code to find the first key with pattern match?..something that looks like object.keys(myobj).findfirstmatch(/prettykey/i);"
