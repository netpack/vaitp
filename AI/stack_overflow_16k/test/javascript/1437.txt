"finding the first letter of every element in an array i was doing some exercises that involved using .map() and it all seemed pretty straight forward. however in one of the examples, i was tasked with using the .map() iterator to return the first letter of every item in an array...see below the code that solved the problem.....const animals = ['hen', 'elephant', 'llama', 'leopard', 'ostrich', 'whale', 'octopus', 'rabbit', 'lion', 'dog'];..const secretmessage = animals.map(firstletter =&gt; {.  return firstletter[0].});.console.log(secretmessage).....my question is, how does the firstletter() function know to return only the first letter of each string within the animals array, rather than just returning the item at index 0 repeatedly?"
