simple blank validation function i do not have any blank experience and would like some assistance in creating a function as i am not sure on how to do it...i would like to create a function that validates that x between 1 and 17 it can also be equal to 1 and 17..if the value is not valid a simple messagebox/alert could be used to notify the user..i know this is a really stupid question but thank you in advance
