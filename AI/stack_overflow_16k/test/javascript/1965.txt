js hangman looping over letters wondering how to make a simple function that would loop through a randomly chosen word and hold all of the letters (most likely in an array) for using in a hangman game. the code below just captures the last letter. ..document.onkeyup = function(event) {                              .  var userinput = event.key;.  for(var i = 0; i &lt; word.charat[i]; i++)                               .    return i;
