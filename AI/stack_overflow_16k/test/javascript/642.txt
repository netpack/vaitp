"short java-script code that will not run, even after debugging i've been working on this assignment, converting pseudocode to java-script. ..i feel confident i have it correctly, but when i try to execute it, i only get a blank white screen...i put it through the sandbox and managed to correct most of the syntax errors that could keep it from running, but it still refuses to work or display anything...i'm still learning and i don't know what i would do without the sandbox to help debug my code, but i'm stuck at what to do when it doesn't find anything further...any suggestions to debug java-script code for a complete newbie?..this is the code:..&lt;html&gt;.&lt;body&gt;.&lt;script type=""text/blank""&gt;..// declare variables.var username;           // potential username entered by user.var char1;              // one character extracted from username.var anydigits = false;  // variable to signify presence of digits.var index;              // loop variable for extracting characters.var br = ""&lt;br /&gt;"";.var es = """";..// display program heading and requirements and ask for username.document.write(""this program helps you set up a valid username."" + br);.document.write(""your username must be at least 8 characters long,"" + br);.document.write(""   start with a letter, and contain at least 1 digit."" + br);.username = prompt(""please enter your name: "", es);..// check for length of username.while (username.length &lt; 8) {.    document.write(""error...your username must be at least 8 characters long."" + br);.    username = prompt(""please enter your new username: "", es);.}..// check that first character is a letter.// substring function has three arguments: string, starting position, and ending position.char1 = username.substr(0, 0);.while (char1 !== isletter()) {.    document.write(""error: the first character of your username must be a letter."" + br);.    username = prompt(""please enter your new username: "", es);.}..// check that there's at least one digit in the username.while (anydigits !== true) {.    // check each character, set anydigits to true if a digit.    for (index = 1; index &lt; username.substr(index, index); index++) {.        char1 = username.substr(index, index);.        if (isnumeric(char1)) {.            anydigits = true;.        }.    }..// if anydigits is still false, no digits were present.    if (anydigits !== true) {.        document.write(""error:...your username must include at least 1 digit."" + br);.        username = prompt(""please enter your new username: "", es);.    }.}..// thank the user and end the program.document.write(""thank you! your new username is: "" + username);..&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/body&gt;.&lt;/html&gt;"
