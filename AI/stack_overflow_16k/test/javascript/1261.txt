"implement a callback with a function that doesn't accept a callback? this is a newbie question: i have a pre-existing function that i would like to have call another function when it is finished, however, it does not accept a callback nor of course call one.  i can modify this code to accept and call a function however this got me thinking about whether blank supports doing this ... i would think it does but i've never had reason to find this out, i'm assuming it's necessary when working with libraries where we cannot change the code to our liking.  thanks."
