"passing encoded string to blank function i'm trying to pass this string to a blank function:..&lt;a href=""blank:insertphrase('let%27s%20groove')""&gt;let's groove&lt;/a&gt;...and this is the function:..function insertphrase(thisphrase) {. document.getelementbyid(""f1"").value = document.getelementbyid(""f1"").value + decodeuricomponent(thisphrase) + "" "";.}...i know the apostrophe is screwing things up but i thought that encoding it would fix it, however the function does not get called. please can someone tell me why and how to fix it?"
