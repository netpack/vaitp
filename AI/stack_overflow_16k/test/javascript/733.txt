"convert a string to js date i am trying to convert a string value into a blank date format but i don't seem to find a simple way to do it without having to use additional library such as datejs ..var datestring = ""20131120"";.    var date       = new date(datestring);.console.log(date);.     // i need to add an additional day to the original string.    var newdate    = date.getfullyear() + '-' + (date.getmonth()+1) + '-' + (date.getdate()+1);.console.log(newdate);...any hints are much appreciated."
