"script inserted with innerhtml not executing i'm trying to ad a script and execute it on a certain place of the page but although the code displays on the page when i inspect the dom, it doesn't get executed...i'm calling this from the head:..function include (selector) {..    document.addeventlistener(""domcontentloaded"", function(){.        var selection = document.queryselector(selector);.        var div = document.createelement(""div"");.        var text = ""&lt;script src='myscript.js'&gt;&lt;/scr""+""ipt&gt;""+.            ""&lt;script&gt;""+.                ""(function(){""+.                    ""console.log('oh yes');""+.                    ""myscript()""+.                ""})();""+.            ""&lt;/scr""+""ipt&gt;"";.            div.innerhtml = text;.        if (selection.nextsibling) {.            selection.parentnode.insertbefore(div, selection.nextsibling);.        }.        else {.            selection.parentnode.appendchild(div);.        }.    });.}...i never get ""oh yes"" in my console. does anyone know why this happens?..i've checked this 2 answers:.can scripts be inserted with innerhtml?.and.executing &lt;script&gt; elements inserted with .innerhtml.the first one doesn't work for strings containing  tags, and the second one just offers a script and no explanation. i'd like to understand if it is possible in this case, and how to make it work, or where to put that function."
