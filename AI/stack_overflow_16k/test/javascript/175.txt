"intermittent pushing of objects to array i have a simple block of code that is not working as intended. the code parses one array of objects and creates a second with the cumulative sizes found in the former array. the code works excellent on some datasets, but fails on others. this is exceedingly odd as all of the datasets were generated using the same tool and have no differences in white space...the point in which the program fails is pushing the newly created object to the array. on some datasets it pushes an empty object, while on others it properly pushes it. example console logs for failure are:..index.html:461 {name: ""chr15"", size: 6397009}..index.html:467 (24) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}] length: 0..while logs for functional code:.461 {name: ""chr4"", size: 28450051}..index.html:467 (35) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]  0: {name: ""nkls02002208_1"", size: 2922554}..var sizetracker=[];..blocks.foreach(function (arrayitem) {.    var tempname=arrayitem.quechr;.    var tempsize=parseint(arrayitem.refend)-parseint(arrayitem.refstart);.    var temptest=false;..    sizetracker.foreach(function (newarrayitem) {.        if(newarrayitem.name==tempname){.            newarrayitem.size=newarrayitem.size+tempsize;.            temptest=true;.        }.    });..    if (temptest==false) {.        var datapoint = {};.        datapoint.name=tempname;.        datapoint.size=tempsize;.        console.log(datapoint);.        sizetracker.push(datapoint);        .    }.});..console.log(sizetracker);...i have no idea at this point. there is no appreciable difference in inputs."
