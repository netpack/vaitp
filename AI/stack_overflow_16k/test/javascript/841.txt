"blank check for empty spaces when css float:left okay now.. i really didn't know how to give this one a title. here is my problem. i am trying to make a page where the body has a class defining the width of another div a.k.a baser. ..i have a jquery script that detects the width of the window and gives body a class hereafter. for example when the width of the window is about 900px - body will be given a class .col_6...each card is 150px in width, but when they have the additional class large they will be 300px in width. the problem now is that depending on the order of the cards in html, there will be some empty spaces if a card.large should be placed in a space only 150px wide. then the card will automatically jump to next row and leave an open space of 150px in the previous row...what i would like to know is - what can i add to my script to perhaps selecting a 150px wide card placed later in the order and move it in the empty spot or filling out the empty spot with a blank made div ( for other purposes )....i hope you are able to figure out my problem by reading this.. i have made a jsfiddle that shows my code and the problem. you can try resizing the window when reading the fiddle. it will show you how an empty space will be seen sometimes...http://jsfiddle.net/ek8q2/4/..here is my blank/jquery if it can help you any way....$(document).ready(function() {.    winresize(window.innerwidth);.});..$(window).resize(function() {.    winresize(window.innerwidth);.    // room for more functions.});..function winresize(w) {.    resizebaser(w);.    // room for more functions.}..function resizebaser(w) {.    var index = math.min(10, math.floor(w / 150));.    if (index &gt; 0) {.        $('body').alterclass('col_*', 'col_' + index);.    }.}"
