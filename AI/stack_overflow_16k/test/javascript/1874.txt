"difference between ecmascript6 and blank as funny as it sounds i recently learned about ecmascript and i know that blank is based on ecmascript. on mozilla website it says that: ..""ecmascript 2015(6) is the current version of the ecmascript language specification standard.(june 17, 2015)""..also i read about the arrow functions and constants, but i can't use them in blank -> ...are these only for es6?.should i stick to blank or start learning es6?"
