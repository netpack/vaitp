"why can't i use map on the result of a queryselectorall? i recently needed to extract the value of several nodes from an html document. i got the nodes using queryselectorall, which returns a list of the nodes that meet the criteria. i had used arr.map before, so i tried to do it like this (which did not work):..var elems = document.queryselectorall('select option:checked');.values = elems.map(function(obj) {return obj.value});...when i read the documentation in mdn, i saw that i had to use something like this instead:..var elems = document.queryselectorall('select option:checked');.var values = array.prototype.map.call(elems, function(obj) {.  return obj.value;.});...my question is, if what i get from queryselectorall is an array, why can't i use the first expression, like i would for any other array?"
