"need blank to change an ad tracker key based off sub domain name i've currently got 4 different blanks for ad tracking. they look something like this:..&lt;script type='text/blank'&gt; var trackerkey = 'keyabc123'; var url = 'http://website.com/jscode.js'; var script = document.createelement('script'); script.setattribute('src', url); script.setattribute('type', 'text/blank'); document.body.appendchild(script);&lt;/script&gt;...i want to combine all 4 and simply have the tracker key swap out based off the sub domain name they're on...thus far i've been able to work out that i would use the window.location.hostname to find what the domain is. and i would probably use a switch statement or if/else approach...i'm not experienced enough though to know how to pass on the information of what the domain is as a variable to the switch statement, and then use that to update the tracker key variable...i assume it might look something like the following.....&lt;script type='text/blank'&gt; ..var domain = window.location.hostname;..var trackerkey;.switch (???) {.    case 0:.        sub.domain1.com = ""keyabc123"";.        break;.    case 1:.        sub.domain2.com = ""keydef456"";.        break;.    case 2:.        sub.domain3.com = ""keyghi789"";.        break;.    case 3:.        sub.domain4.com = ""keyjkl012"";.        break;.}..var url = 'http://website.com/jscode.js'; var script = document.createelement('script'); script.setattribute('src', url); script.setattribute('type', 'text/blank'); document.body.appendchild(script);&lt;/script&gt;...am i remotely on the right path? ..apologies, this is my first stab at something beyond the very basics."
