"how do i add (sum) individual radio button groups? i have programmed an online assessment which can calculate the total score and display it as a percentage. however, each of the questions pertain to different categories and i would like to be able to calculate and show the results for the different categories...example: i need to sum radio buttons 1, 9, 17, 25 &amp; 33 for the ""career"" category and display the result in the ""career"" category text field in the results box at the bottom of the page. i have 8 categories and don't want to put all the questions for each category together because the person taking the assessment will figure out how it's calculated and might manipulate it to get a higher score. i have googled so many alternatives and they only show adding(sum) radio buttons consecutively. please can someone help me with the code for this as i have no clue and have spent 2 days trying to figure it out."
