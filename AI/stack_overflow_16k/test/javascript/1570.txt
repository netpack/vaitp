how can i remove an object from an array if i know the value of one field of the object? i tried to find out some good examples but so seems to have mainly examples from 4-5 years ago and i would like to use a solution that would work using modern browser capabilities...ihave an array of test objects:.. var tests;...each test object contains a testid...how can i remove test object with testid = 25 from the array tests. i was thinking of a for loop but is there a cleaner way to do this?
