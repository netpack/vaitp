"method pointer/ref in blank here is an example of my current code :..var myobject = new obj();..if(something).    myobject.method1(arg1, arg2);.else.    myobject.method2(arg1, arg2);...and how i declared my obj :..function obj() { }..obj.prototype.method1 = function(a, b) { }.obj.prototype.method2 = function(a, b) { }...since i'm doing this kind of test a bunch of time, i was wondering if it was possible to do something like that : ..if(something).    var method = method1;.else.    var method = method2;..myobject.method(arg1, arg2);"
