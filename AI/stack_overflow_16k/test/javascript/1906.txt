"problem with an event registering multiple times currently i have it set to ""if true == true"" just to simplify because the problem isn't there. ....switchboxes(player){.    if (true == true){.        document.addeventlistener(""keypress"", function switchlisten(event) {.            if (event.keycode == 101) {.                console.log(""trapactivated"");.            }.        }, {once:true});.    }.}.....i have a problem in my game that i am making in blank where i see ""trapactivated"" hundreds of times in the console when i only press the key 'e' once. switchboxes is a function in a class called collisionobjects. it is meant to create a box that acts as a switch and effects some other part of the map i created when you press the key 'e'. the player is able to move around the map freely around the canvas. instead of ""if true == true"", i had collision detection for the player to see if he was touching the switch. the parameter 'player' is so that you can choose who is able to use that switch. when i press 'e', the console gives me anywhere from around 34 to 500 messages. it stops very soon after i have pressed 'e', around 100-200 milliseconds later. and i haven't done anything with the framerate, so it should be whatever the default is...this is my first question on this site so please forgive me if it is not as specific as it should be."
