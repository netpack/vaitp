"a repeating countdown timer that continues even after browser refresh firstly i am very new to blank. i have a shopify store and i am planning to have a countdown timer just like amazon to each of my product pages. i know there are a lot of plugins i can use for shopify but none of them matches with the theme and style of my shopify store so i planned to make one myself...what i want is if user-1 opens my website and navigates to a product page, he should see a timer counting down to a specific time say 12:00:00 (hh:mm:ss). suppose user-1 sees 'deal ends in 11:20:10' now if user-2 opens the same product page at the same time then he should also see 'deal ends in 11:20:10' the whole point is the timer should not refresh back to 12:00:00 every time the browser loads/reloads the page and every user on the website should see the same time remaining on the countdown timer...i starting with a bit of research and managed to run a timer on my store. it's not exactly what i want but here's the code:..    var interval;.    var minutes = 1;.    var seconds = 5;.    window.onload = function() {.        countdown('countdown');.    }..    function countdown(element) {.        interval = setinterval(function() {.            var el = document.getelementbyid(element);.            if(seconds == 0) {.                if(minutes == 0) {.                    el.innerhtml = ""countdown's over!"";                    .                    clearinterval(interval);.                    return;.                } else {.                    minutes--;.                    seconds = 60;.                }.            }.            if(minutes &gt; 0) {.                var minute_text = minutes + (minutes &gt; 1 ? ' minutes' : ' minute');.            } else {.                var minute_text = '';.            }.            var second_text = seconds &gt; 1 ? 'seconds' : 'second';.            el.innerhtml = minute_text + ' ' + seconds + ' ' + second_text + ' remaining';.            seconds--;.        }, 1000);.    }.    &lt;/script&gt;...and here's what it looks like:....it does work but has the following problems:...it refreshes with the browser refresh..it doesn't have hours..it does not auto-repeat when the timer reaches zero..for every user time remaining varies....as i mentioned i am almost a noob in blank. can anyone help me build a countdown timer that overcomes the above issues?"
