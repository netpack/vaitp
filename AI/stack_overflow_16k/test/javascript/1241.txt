"both onblur and onchange not working with <input type=""text"" i have a standard input type text field that is supposed to trigger a blank whenever it is changed. first i tried onchange, however it just did nothing. then i tried onblur, but also here it did not do anything...html code:..&lt;input type=""text"" size=""1"" class=""inputbox"" onblur=""c();"" name=""qty"" value=""1"" /&gt;...the blank should not be the problem, because i am triggering this with another select dropdown menu as well and there it works fine! just on this text field it seems not to work. anyways, here's the blank code:..function c() {.$('#add4').fadeout(function(){.        $('#add5').css('visibility', 'visible');.        document.u.submit();.}); .}...i checked online, but could not find any relevant posts or hints in this regard whatsoever. any ideas what's wrong?"
