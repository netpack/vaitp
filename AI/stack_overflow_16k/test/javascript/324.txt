"blank - anyway to remove all base methods and attributes of an object but keep one? i'm building some app which scans the dom for elements and their children. right now, i can get the data i need with the following line of code:..var bodyobj = document.getelementsbytagname(""body"")[0].children;...the problem, that the bodyobj object is spammed with unnecessary methods and attributes, i only want to keep the children method and clean the rest. any way of achieving this?..ps.pure js."
