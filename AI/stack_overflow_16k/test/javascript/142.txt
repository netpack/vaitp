"sort strings and numbers in blank i'd like to sort numbers and strings like this article: sort strings and numbers in ruby..and i prepared the following method to compare values...# this method is expected to work ruby's `&lt;=&gt;`..compare: (x, y) -&gt;.  if x &lt; y then -1 else if x &gt; y then 1 else 0...but blank's comparison works different from ruby's one...x = [1, 11].y = [1, 2]..compare(x, y).# it expected to return 1 (means [1, 11] &gt; [1, 2]).# but it returns -1 (means [1, 2] &gt; [1, 11])...though 11 is obviously greater that 2, array's second value seems not to be compared correctly...could you tell me what's wrong?"
