"how to loop a function indefinitely (instead of using conventional for-loop) i've got a code that will run a set of 20 images, to make it look like an idle sprite is breathing when idle. this runs perfect when its only one loop...however i can't get it to repeat that loop indefinitely...is there a cleaner and faster way to do what i'm doing?..enclosing that in another for loop doesn't work. it ends in it never loading...for(let i = 0; i &lt; images.length; i++) {.    window.settimeout(function () {.        ctx.clearrect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);.        ctx.drawimage(images[i], 100, 100);.    }, 100 * i);.}...i expect it to keep looping indefinitely."
