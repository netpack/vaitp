"trying to find the average i need to know why when i try to divide student 1,student 2 and student 3. i think it might be a looping error since the number that it give's me is numbering in the thousands but i don't see how that could be happening...function averageofthreescores() {.    var student1;.    var student2;.    var student3;.    var end;.    do {.        student1 = prompt(""what are the scorces of students 1?"");.        student2 = prompt(""what are the scorces of students 2?"");.        student3 = prompt(""what are the scorces of students 3?"");.        end = prompt(""would you like to end, type yes to end."");.        var average = (student1 + student2 + student3) / 3;.    if (average &lt;= 59) {.        document.write(average + "" your score is f &lt;br/&gt;"");..    } else if (average &lt;= 69) {.        document.write(average + "" your score is d &lt;br/&gt;"");..    } else if (average &lt;= 79) {.        document.write(average + "" your score is c &lt;br/&gt;"");..    } else if (average &lt;= 95) {.        document.write(average + ""that's a great score &lt;br/&gt;"");..    } else if (average &lt;= 100) {.        document.write(average + ""god like &lt;/br&gt;"");..    } else {.        document.write(average + "" end &lt;br/&gt;"");.    }..}.while (end != ""yes"");...}"
