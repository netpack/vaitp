"test if a variable is a primitive rather than an object? is it possible to test a variable to see if it is a primitive?..i have seen lots of questions about testing an variable to see if it is an object, but not testing for a primitive...this question is academic, i don't actually need to perform this test from my own code.  i'm just trying to get a deeper understanding of blank."
