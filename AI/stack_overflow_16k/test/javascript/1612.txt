"changing variable of blank object (this.variable) not working im trying to understand blank objects but i got stuck on a problem..why is this variable returning ""nan""?..function game(){..    this.players = 0;.    this.round = 0;.    this.turn = this.round / this.players;..}..var game = new game();.game.players = 5;.game.round = 10;..console.log(game.turn);...game.turn should be 2 not nan...the problem is that ""this.players"" and ""this.round"" is not changing and since you cant divide by 0 it returns nan...i rewrote it and surprisingly this worked...function game(){..    this.players = 0;.    this.round = 0;..    this.turn = function(){..        return this.round / this.players;..    }..}.var game = new game();.game.players = 5;.game.round = 10;..console.log(game.turn());...why does the second part of code work but not the first?"
