"why to use prototype when we can just add a property i have this javasctipt class..function employee(name, jobtitle, born).{.    this.name = name;.    this.jobtitle = jobtitle;.    this.born = born;.}..var fred = new employee(""fred flintstone"", ""caveman"", 1970);.employee.prototype.salary = null;.fred.salary = 20000;.fred.notprototype = 1239;.console.log(fred);...now as you can see i added salary property using prototype but then i just added a property by using fred.notprototype = 1239; without the use of prototype. ..when i did the console.log on object fred i see notprototype there. so is it wrong not to add the prototype? if it is then what difference is it making?"
