"value of this when used with function.call giving unexpected output i am learning blank i was trying to understand the concept of this when used with apply/call but i am stuck in this code...foo = function(){.  console.log(this).}.foo.call(""random"")...the output is giving a string object as expected but why the string is shown as an array of string...string { 0=""r"", 1=""a"", 2=""n"", 3=""d"", 4=""o"", 5=""m"" }...what i was expecting was...string{ }...which is the case with numbers..foo.call(121)...where output is..number{ }"
