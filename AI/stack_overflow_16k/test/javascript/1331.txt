"create a copy of object, then deleted an element only from the copy, not the original how do i make obj2 the same as obj1 but not affected by the deletion?..currently the name: 42 entry will be deleted from both objects...is it because of hoisting - that is, the deletion occurs before obj2 is created?....var obj1 = {. 'name': 'john',. 'age': 42,.}..var obj2 = obj1..delete obj1['name']..console.log(obj1).console.log(obj2)"
