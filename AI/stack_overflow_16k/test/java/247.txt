"how to cause a program to end when a certain number of entities are killed i'm working on a game for a school project and i am trying to make it so that when a certain amount of entities are killed, the game will end. however i am running into an issue with the decreasing of my variable. here's what i have so far:..public class guy extends staticentity {..public int count = 2;..}..public void die(){...     count--;..     if(count == 0){.        system.exit(1);.                   }...on the entity dying, it should be decreasing the count variable by one, but after destroying 2 of this entity, it doesn't do anything. if i do it with 1 entity, it works fine...if you need anything else from my code, i am willing to provide it, this is my first time asking a question on the website so i don't know if i need to provide anything else and i'm a novice at coding."
