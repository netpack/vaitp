"returning value of private variable my instructor said that if the class has private variables and when you want to return values of those variables via getters,  if their data types are primitive, you can just directly return their values, but if they're of reference types, a general rule of thumb is that you should almost always return object.clone(). then i'm wondering in what case you wouldn't need to return object.clone()?"
