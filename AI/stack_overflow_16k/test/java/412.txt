"declaring class inside a method - final keyword given the following inner class (issomething) within a method: ..public class innermethod {..private int x;...public class something {.    private int y;..    public void printmynumber(double x).    {.        class issomething extends something {..            public void print() {.                system.out.println(x);.            }..        }.    }.}..}...why does the x variable has to be final to make it work..?.(i'm talking ofc about the x parameter of the ""printmynumber"" function.)"
