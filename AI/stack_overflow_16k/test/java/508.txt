"why doesn't making the return type string allow me to return a string in a function so what i expected this code to display on console was ...  ""hi"".  .  ""ken is a legend"".  .  ""forkbomb""...public class forkbombonclick {.  public static void main(string[] args) {.    system.out.println(""hi"");.    ken();.    system.out.println(""fork bomb"");.  }.  public static string ken() {.    return (""ken is a legend"");.  }.}...but instead it only displays hi and forkbomb. when i change it to public static void ken() then it returns what i wanted the value to be but i was wondering. why doesn't this current code work?"
