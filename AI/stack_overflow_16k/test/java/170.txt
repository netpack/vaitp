"potential resource leak warning eclipse complains that the response.body() could be a potential resource leak. will there actually be a leak here? the documentation says that response.body().string() will close the resource.     ..just to be clear, i understand how (try-with-resources) to resolve the warning. i'm just wondering in what case will the resource actually be leaked here? if it's not null, it should get automatically closed. if it is null, well... then there is nothing to close... ?..response is: okhttp3.response..try {.    if (response.body() != null) {.        string respbody = response.body().string();.    }.} catch (ioexception e) {.    throw new apiexception(e);.}...as per one of the answers, i attempted to do the following and got the same warning: ..try {.    responsebody body = response.body().    if (body != null) {.        string respbody = body.string();.    }.} catch (ioexception e) {.    throw new apiexception(e);.}"
