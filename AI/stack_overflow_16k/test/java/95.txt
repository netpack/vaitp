"could not find main class...jar or manifest i am very new to programming but i am trying to learn.  i have picked up quite a bit but some concepts just seem to go over my head.  it seems like when you are learning like me and you search for a problem, you get many many different answers.  sometimes the way the answers are worded can but confusing to a beginner.  anyway, here is my problem...i have created a very simple program that will do a basic calculation of cmu blocks in a wall.  i used the joptionpane instead of console.  i wrote the code in notepad, then saved it as a .blank file (blocktestgui.blank).  i then compiled it with the command ""blankc blocktestgui.blank"" to get the ""bg.class"" file.  i can run the program from cmd with ""blank bg"" and it works great.  my real problem comes with the jar file.  i created a manifest.txt file with main-class: bg then an empty line following.  then i use ""jar cvmf manifest.txt cmu.jar bg.class"" and i get a jar file.  then whenever i run it (in cmd or double clicking) i get ""could not find main class"" error...here is what i have:..my blank file:..import blankx.swing.joptionpane;..class bg {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        string firstnumber, secondnumber;.        double number1, number2, sum;..        firstnumber = joptionpane.showinputdialog(.                ""enter wall length in decimal feet:"", .                joptionpane.information_message);..        secondnumber = joptionpane.showinputdialog(.                ""enter wall height in decimal feet:"", .                joptionpane.information_message);..        number1 = double.parsedouble(firstnumber);.        number2 = double.parsedouble(secondnumber);..        sum = (number1 * number2) / 0.88;..        joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, ""total blocks are "" + sum, .                ""results"", joptionpane.plain_message);..        system.exit(0);.    }.}...my jar contains my bg.class file and this is what my manifest file looks like:..manifest-version: 1.0.created-by: 1.7.0_02 (oracle corporation).main-class: bg...i'm at a loss because my blank file works but the jar doesn't.  any help would be great."
