"different eclipse output for processor than machine what does it mean when internally inside my desktop (purchased as used) i have core i7 processor and in system info it says the same, but when i was programming in eclipse editor for blank i typed system.out.print (system.getproperty (""os.arch"")); and it prints amd64 in the console? ..does it mean i have different processor architecture and different processor inside? how can an amd processor be replaced with intel as their architectures are totally different?"
