"specify type of collection in subclass i have an application in which users can play many types of games. each game extends the game class which has various things relating to the game in it. each game also has an associated user class which extends user (contains email, username etc.) such as chessuser and scrabbleuser which contain statistics and other user information about the game...in each game class i need a list of all users currently playing the game. as all games will need this list i would like to place it in the user class but as it contains the type of user that plays the game (chessgame would contain a list of chessusers) i cannot do this without casting the value when retrieved which i would rather not do. is there a way of doing this without casting the retrieved value?..some example code:..public class game {.  private list&lt;player&gt; players;..  public player getplayer(int index) {.    return players.get(index);.  }.}..public class player {.  private string username;.  private string email;.}..public class chessgame extends game {.  // getplayer now needs to return a chessplayer, hopefully without casting.}..public class chessplayer extends player {.  private int checkmates;.}"
