"validating boolean input using while loop i'm doing some blank homework and i can't get this while loop to work correctly...i've tried to editing the code, but it keeps giving errors...while(true) {.            system.out.println(""is student a ta? (1: yes 0: no): "");.                status = inreader.nextint();.                    if (status == 1) {.                        status1 = true;.                    }.                    else if (status == 0) {.                            status1 = false;.                    }.                    else {.                        system.out.println(""please enter valid entry."");.                    } .            graduate grad = new graduate(studentid, name, major, status1);.            grad.displaystudentdata();.                }   .            }.        }.   }...i want the code to loop back if the user inputs anything other than a 0 or 1..it does loop back but the information gets outputted to the console. which is not what i was hoping it would do."
