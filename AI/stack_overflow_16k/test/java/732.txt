"printing out multiple random results i'm making a random creature generator, its going all nice and dandy, however when it comes to printing the results, it prints the same result 5 times. i tried some different things like using println() multiple times and do while loops, however every time i run the file i just get a bunch of the same results. ""a b c d e"" are strings that generate the creature..int x = 1;.do {.  system.out.println(x +"" "" +a +"" "" +b +"" "" +c +"" "" +d +"" "" +e);.  x++;.} while (x&lt;=5);"
