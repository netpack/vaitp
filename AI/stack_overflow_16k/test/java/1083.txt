"first ever blank program incorrect output sorry for really stupid question, i'm learning a new language and taking this code:..public class exercise01 {.    int i;.    char c;..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        exercise01 e = new exercise01();.        system.out.println(""i = "" + e.i);.        system.out.println(""c = ["" + e.c + ""]"");.    }.}./* output:.i = 0.c = [.*/...why the output does not produce ""]"" character? has it something to do with unicode?..postedited: the variable e.c was not initialized for experimentation purpose."
