difference between static declaration and non static declaration static variables: are the class variables and they are not created separately for each object of the class..instance variables: are also the class variables but are created for each object separately..the above definitions are just for references.  ..please explain why i am getting error in this class declaration.i know it is just because i have not of initialised x...class non_static{.public static void main(string args[]).{.int x;.system.out.println(x);..}.}...but this class declaration is totally fine...class static_example{.static int x;.public static void main(string args[]).{.system.out.println(x);.}..}...and output of this program is 0.  ..please do explain me why static member is initialized with the default value while local variables are not.
