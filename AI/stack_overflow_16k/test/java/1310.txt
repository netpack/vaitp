"how to replace the ""-"" with the guessed letters? i am trying to make a hangman game with string methods, however, i am having trouble replacing the ""-"" with the correct letter guessed, the specifications on my problem says that i need to concatenate the dashes with the letters that were guessed correctly. ..this is the code i have so far for the method that checks if the letter is in the word..public static string reveal(string word, string guess) .    {.        string dashprints = ""-"", wholeword="" "";.        for (int index=0; index&lt;= word.length();index++).        {.            if(index==word.indexof(letters)).            {.                return dashprints;.            }.            else.            {.                dashprints=letters;.            }.            wholeword= dashprints+ wholeword;..        }.            return wholeword;...the word in the game is:.graphics..and the initial output is this:..""---------""..and the wanted output is:..""g-------""..however, the output i am getting right now is just this:..""-"""
