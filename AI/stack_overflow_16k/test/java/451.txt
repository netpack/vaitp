how to use an executorcompletionservice i would like to use the constructor on the executorcompletionservice which takes a pre-defined blockingqueue...can anyone provide a code snippet to show how this is done.  it seems only to take a a blockingqueue with futures.  how does this match with the fact that submit must be done with callables...i'm getting a little confused here - please help...
