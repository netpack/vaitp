"unable to see the output while recording the key strokes using jnativehook i'm trying to record the keystrokes when ever i perform some key events like left,right,move,press,release etc.initially when i wrote the code and compiled it i was able to record the key strokes.however,when i compiled after a little bit of code indentation it is showing the following statement..  process finished with exit code 0...below posted is my code:..public class key_logger implements nativekeylistener {..public void nativekeypressed(nativekeyevent e) {..    system.out.println(""key pressed: "" + nativekeyevent.getkeytext(e.getkeycode()));..          if (e.getkeycode() == nativekeyevent.vk_escape).          {..               globalscreen.unregisternativehook();.           }..  }..public void nativekeyreleased(nativekeyevent e) {..    system.out.println(""key released: "" + nativekeyevent.getkeytext(e.getkeycode()));..}..public void nativekeytyped(nativekeyevent e) {..    system.out.println(""key typed: "" + e.getkeytext(e.getkeycode()));..}..public static void main(string[] args) {..    try {..        globalscreen.registernativehook();..    }..    catch (nativehookexception ex) {..        system.err.println(""there was a problem registering the native hook."");..        system.err.println(ex.getmessage());..        system.exit(1);.    }..    //construct the example object and initialze native hook..    globalscreen.getinstance().addnativekeylistener(new key_logger());.}.  }"
