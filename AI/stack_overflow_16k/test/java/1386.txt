"should auto unboxing of numbers in blank use number.xxxvalue() rather than cast to xxx.xxxvalue()? examples work best, imagine object is a byte and we attempt to cast it to a long.....currently the byte code looks a bit like this..   byte b = byte.valueof(1);.   object source = b;.   long long = (long) source;     // fails cce because a byte is not a long.   long value = long.longvalue();...wouldnt a cast to number be better ?..  byte b = byte.valueof(1);.   number number = (number) b;     // f.   long value = number.longvalue();...the real problem is of course we have reduce the possibility for classcastexceptions, is that a bad thing ?"
