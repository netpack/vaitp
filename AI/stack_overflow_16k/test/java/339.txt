"accessibility rules for this and super i'm having difficulty following the accessibility rules in the blank documentation. i can't find a clear answer to this question...suppose you are inside the body of an instance method of a class c and that variable c has compile time type c...e.g. suppose you have..class c {..    &lt;returntype&gt; instancemethod(...) {.        c c;.        ... .    }.}...is it true that the set of members (methods or fields) of c and its superclasses that you can access for this is exactly the same as the set of members you can access for c? in other words is it true that this.member is allowed exactly when c.member is allowed? or does the fact that it's this make a difference?..does it work for super? in other words if the superclass of c is d and d has compile time type d, is it true that super.member is allowed exactly when d.member is allowed?"
