"in blank is there a static version of 'this' i know this is quite minor, but at the top of every class i end up copying and pasting and then changing the following line of code...private static final string tag = myclass.class.getname();...what i would like to do is not to have to modify the myclass bit every time i copy...i.e. i would like to write this...private static final string tag = this.class.getname();...but clearly there is no this at this point. i know its minor, but i generally learn something from so answers, and indeed learnt some good stuff just searching to see if there was an answer already."
