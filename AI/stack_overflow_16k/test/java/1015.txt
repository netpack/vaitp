"blank having troubles with buttongroup and .values() first time poster, long time lurker...i'm having troubles with the following piece of code!.what it's supposed to do is generate 2 radio buttons and then cleverly decide which one to activate when opening a window...there's two parts to this, a carcolorbuttonmodel that extends jtogglebutton.togglebuttonmodel, and a carcolorbuttongroup, this extends buttongroup..the method i'm having trouble with is the following:..public class carcolorbuttongroup extends buttongroup.{..    public void setvalue(color c).    {.        for(abstractbutton b: getelements()).        {.            stuff.        }.    ......no matter what i do it won't run. even .values() isn't helping..any ideas?..edit follow-ups:..the error i'm currently getting is: ""can only iterate over an array or an instance of blank.lang.iterable"". the other solution i've tried is to declare the enumeration and array before the method, i.e.:..enumeration&lt;abstractbutton&gt; e = getelements();.abstractbutton[] ara = e.values();...it doesn't like this, however, it claims that ""values() is undefined for the type enumeration...to be clear, the method is supposed to cycle through each button and see if its saved color matches up with c. the code fails at the for loop for the above mentioned reasons."
