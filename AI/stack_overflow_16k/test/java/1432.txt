"blank values not adding together i'm trying to make it so i retrieve the value of a text field, and when i select a checkbox, it will add the value of a1 to the value of the text field. ..for example, the textfield = 12..a1 = 35..i want it to add to 47 but it just updates to 35. this is what i have so far..if(mon.isselected()) {.pear.settext(string.valueof(+a1));.}...where am i going wrong?"
