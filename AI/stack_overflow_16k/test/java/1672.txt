"blank field initialisation to functions that throw exceptions i have a problem which reduces down to considering this class:..class myclass.{.    static int s_int = getinteger();..    static int getinteger() throws myclassexception.    {.        ......here's my problem: this will not compile since getinteger() throws myclassexception and i don't have a try catch block when initialising s_int...one solution, of course, would be to build a getintegeranddealwiththeexception() which doesn't throw an exception and call that instead when initialising s_int. but i'd rather not as that is not so pretty: i'd rather not litter the code with stubs...am i missing a syntatic trick here with my initialisation of s_int?..many thanks!"
