"strange behaviour on blank method : isassignablefrom(class<?>) if you try the following piece of code ( i've tried it on blank 6) : ..system.out.println(collection.class.isassignablefrom(set.class));...it prints out : false but i was expecting to print out : true because blankdoc is saying : ..determines if the class or interface represented by this class object is either the same as, or is a superclass or superinterface of, the class or interface represented by the specified class parameter...but collection is a superclass of set : public interface set&lt;e&gt; extends collection&lt;e&gt; ...so what is the explanation of this strange behaviour?"
