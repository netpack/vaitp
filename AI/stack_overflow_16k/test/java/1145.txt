"how to persist a hashtable i have to persist a hash table which respect the following order : key, value = father, children...i tried some approaches like..for(acao pacao : hashtableacaodotacao.keyset()){.    for(dotacao pdotacao : hashtableacaodotacao.get(pacao)){..    }.}...where acao is the key and the value is a arraylist, but for some reason the hashtable can't find the key pacao."
