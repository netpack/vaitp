"storing 10m unique records and accessing it efficiently i came across this interview test question:....  there is long list of alphanumerically sorted names with one phone.  number next to each one. it is long list containing 10m names and.  numbers. one time disk pre processing is allowed. after that how would.  i find a number for a input name without hitting the disk?...my first reaction would be to store all these numbers in a hashmap &lt;string, string&gt;. this will o(1) runtime to access phone number for a given name. not sure if map is the right data structure to store 10m records...is there an efficient way of doing that?"
