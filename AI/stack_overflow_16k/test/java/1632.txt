"blank - string.format with hyphen writing my first real bit of blank code and i'm struggling to figure out this one out...i need to generate a string in set format:..code:100-100-100...i'm using string.format to try and generate it:..string templateformat = ""code:%1$-%2$s-100"";.string code = string.format(templateformat, ""100"", ""100"", ""100"");...but the hyphen has special meaning to the formatter, how can i escape it?..tried to escape the hyphen with a """" but eclipse rightly informed me:..invalid escape sequence (valid ones are b t n f r "" '  )..cheers"
