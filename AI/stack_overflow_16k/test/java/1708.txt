"indexoutofboundsexception: index -1 out of bounds for length 0 i am working on a project given to me for classwork and we are modifying a library system that allows one to addpatrons to the library system, addbooks is already done for me and i have used that as a template to create addpatrons. i have completed it but whenever im trying to create it i get the following error... indexoutofboundsexception: index -1 out of bounds for length 0...here is where the code is going wrong...public void execute(library library, localdate currentdate) throws libraryexception {.    int lastindex = library.getpatrons().size() -1;.    int maxid = library.getpatrons().get(lastindex).getid();.    patron patron = new patron(++maxid, name, phone);.    library.addpatron(patron);.    system.out.println(""patron #"" + patron.getid() + "" added."");...the add patron takes in two values name and phone...thanks for your time"
