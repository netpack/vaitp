"blank puzzle: modifiers can you, please, tell me .1) why it is possible to assign a constructor as public for a package-visible class? for example:..class testmodifiers {.    public testmodifiers() {..    }.}...this class can't be instantiated everywhere but in the same package. so that isn't it enough to use a package-visible modifier for a constructor? that is also true with any method(public) in such a class(package-visible) ..2) say, in an inner class i have created two private variables. why can i see them from the outer class? isn't it strange?? for example: ..class a {.  a(){}..  class b {.    private int b1;.    private int b2;.  }..  public static void main(string[] args) {.   new b().b1 = 1;.   new b().b2 = 2;.  }. }"
