"what is printed as a result of executing the following program / blank? i have got a piece of blank code that i struggle to understand how the code works. ..the most embarrassing thing about it is, i actually know what it prints out since i used blue-j, and i did also de-bugging to understand how this code works,but i still didn't understand how the code works, if you understand it please explain it step-by-step, thanks in advance, anyway this is my code:..public class t13 {.    private static int s = 1;.    private int id;.    t13() {.        id = s;.        s++;.    }.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        t13 t1 = new t13(); .        system.out.println(""t1: "" + t1.id + "", "" + t1.s);.        t13 t2 = new t13();.        system.out.println(""t2: "" + t2.id + "", "" + t2.s);.    }.}...and it prints out following:..t1: 1, 2.t2: 2, 3"
