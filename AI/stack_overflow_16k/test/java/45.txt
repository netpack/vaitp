"leap year blank q i need to write a method for a leap year. so the method has to be called printleap and checks to see if the number is a leap year or not. so the the blank program will test the method by reading a list of year number and only displays the leap years.. here is what i have done:..import blank.util.scanner;.public class ex1partaassig3 {..public static int printleap(string string) {.    scanner sc1=new scanner(system.in);.    {.        system.out.println(""this programe calculates leap year."");.        int year= printleap (""enter the year:"");.        if ((year%4==0)&amp;&amp; year % 100 !=0).    }.    system.out.println(year + ""is a leap year."");.    {.    else if ((year % 4==0) &amp;&amp; (year % 100==0)&amp;&amp;(year % 400==0)).    {.        system.out.println(year +""is a leap year."");.    }.    else {.    }.        system.out.println(year + "" is not a leap year."");..    }..}..}...the areas that are showing a mistake are underline the first 'else'.    else if ((year % 4==0) &amp;&amp; (year % 100==0)&amp;&amp;(year % 400==0)..and two curly brackets, the first just above the second system.out.and the 1st bracket at the very bottom.there is 3 brackets on the bottom but its the first 1...could some help me to run this program or what i have forgotten thank you?"
