"how to reference an instance of an object by a string in blank? as my title states i am trying to dynamically reference an instance of an object by a string. since i likely do not use the exact correct technical terms, here is basically the starting situtation.:..myclass instance123 = new myclass();.string referer = ""instance123"";...what i want to do it, refer to the object instance123 by the string referer...e.g.:..callobjectbystring(referer).anymethodofmyclass();...which i would normally call like:..instance123.anymethodofmyclass();...i hope this is somewhat understandable and possible. i know that there is always a different way to program amd i could surely work around this problem somehow but i still want to find a solution to this problem!"
