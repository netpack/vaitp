"comparison between double type values i declared three real number values and tried to compare each value as below codes...public class main {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        float f = 0.1f;.        double d= 0.1;.        double d2 = (double)f;..        system.out.println(d);.        system.out.println(d2);.        system.out.println();..        system.out.println(d==f);.        system.out.println(d==d2);.        system.out.println(d2==f);.    }.}...in first comparison (d==f), since the d is a double type whereas f is a float type, so the compiler changed the variable f into double type. it means that the value stored in f will be reassigned into double type values. therefore this comparison returns false. and also, d==d2 comparison is executed and returns false as a same way in first comparison. ..however, the last comparison d2==f, it returns true. i expected it returned the false because the variable f were reassigned into the double type value and the values stored in d2 and f will be slightly different. however, the results is true...can you explain the third comparison why it gave the true?"
