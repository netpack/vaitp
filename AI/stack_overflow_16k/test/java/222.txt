"exception in thread main: method is undefined for the type i am working on creating a dice game simulation and got the following error: ..exception in thread ""main"" blank.lang.error: unresolved compilation problem: .    the method displaygrandwinner(player, player) is undefined for the type chohan...i am going to post all of the code for this class below because i am not sure where the error is, but i think the only necessary code is the displaygrandwinner method:.import blank.util.scanner;..public class chohan {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        final int max_rounds = 5; // number of rounds .        string player1name;  // first player's name.        string player2name; //second player's name..         // create a scanner object for keyboard input.        scanner keyboard = new scanner(system.in);...        //get the player's names.        system.out.println(""enter the firs tplayers name:"");.        player1name = keyboard.nextline();.        system.out.println(""enter the second players name:"");.        player2name = keyboard.nextline();..        //create the dealer.        dealer dealer = new dealer();..        //create the two players.        player player1 = new player(player1name);.        player player2 = new player(player2name);..        //play the rounds.        for(int round = 0; round &lt; max_rounds; round++){..            system.out.println(""--------------------------"");.            system.out.printf(""now playing round %d.n"", round+1);..            //roll the dice .            dealer.rolldice();..            //the players make their guesses.            player1.makeguess();.            player2.makeguess();..            //determine the winner of this round.            roundresults(dealer, player1, player2);.        }..        //display the grand winner .        displaygrandwinner(player1, player2);.    }..    /**.     * the roundresults method determines the results of the current round.     * @param dealer the dealer object.     * @param player1 player #1 object.     * @param player2 player #2 object.     */..    public static void roundresults(dealer dealer, player player1, player player2){.        //show the dice values.        system.out.printf(""the dealer rolled %d and %d.n"", dealer.getdie1value(), dealer.getdie2value());.        system.out.printf(""result: %sn"", dealer.getchoorhan());..        //check each players guess and award points .        checkguess(player1, dealer);.        checkguess(player2, dealer);.    }..    /**.     * the checkguess method checks a player's guess against the dealer's result..     * @param player the player object to check .     * @param dealer the dealer object.     */..    public static void checkguess(player player, dealer dealer){.        final int points_to_add = 1; //points to award the winner.        string guess = player.getguess(); //player's guess.        string chohanresult = dealer.getchoorhan(); //cho or han..        //display the player's guess.        system.out.printf(""the player %s guessed %sn"", player.getname(), player.getguess());..        //award points if the player guessed correctly.        if(guess.equalsignorecase(chohanresult)){.            player.addpoints(points_to_add);.            system.out.printf(""awarding %d points to %sn"", points_to_add,player.getname());.        }..        /**.         * the displaygrandwinner method displays the games grand winner.         * @param player1 player #1.         * @param player2 player #2.         */..    public static void displaygrandwinner(player player1, player player2){.        system.out.println(""----------------------------"");.        system.out.println(""game over. here are the results:"");.        system.out.printf(""%s: %d points.n"", player1.getname(), player1.getpoints());.        system.out.printf(""%s: %d points.n"", player2.getname(), player2.getpoints());..        if(player1.getpoints() &gt; player2.getpoints()).            system.out.println(player1.getname() +"" is the winner"");.        else if(player2.getpoints() &gt; player1.getpoints()) .            system.out.println(player2.getname() +"" is the winner"");.        else.            system.out.println(""tie"");..        }.    }...}...why is the displaygrandwinner method not registering as part of the chohan class?"
