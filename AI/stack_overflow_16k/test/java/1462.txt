"error: incompatible types: double cannot be converted to double[] i am trying to write a code which receives three different combinations of mass and volume and then stores each value into two different arrays: mass and volume..it is also required that i create a method in order to calculate the density..however, when i try to call the method in order to calculate with the inputted masses and volumes, i receive an error.  ..this is the error:  ...  density.blank:19: error: incompatible types: double cannot be converted.  to double[].  system.out.printf(""%.2f"",calculatedensity(mass[0],volume[0]));...note: some messages have been simplified; recompile with -xdiags:verbose to get full output.1 error.here's my code:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class density {.    public static void main (string [] args) {.        double [] mass = new double[3];.        double [] volume = new double[3];.        scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.        system.out.println(""enter the mass and volume for your three compounds."");..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3;i++) {.            system.out.print(""enter mass in grams:  "");.            mass[i] = scan.nextdouble();.            system.out.print(""enter volume in millimeters:  "");.            volume[i] = scan.nextdouble();.        }..        system.out.print(""the density for mass = "");.        system.out.printf(""%.2f"", mass[0]);.        system.out.print(""g and volume = "");.        system.out.printf(""%.2f"", volume[0]);.        system.out.print(""ml is: "");.        system.out.printf(""%.2f"",calculatedensity(mass[0],volume[0]));.    }..    public static void calculatedensity (double[] mass, double[] volume) {.        double [] density = new double [3];.        density[0] = mass[0] / volume[0];.    }.}...i would love some help trying to figure out what is wrong. i am not entirely sure how to define methods with arrays or call methods using arrays..any help is appreciated..thank you!"
