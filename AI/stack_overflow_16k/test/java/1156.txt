why is it allowed to label almost every statement in blank? i understand that the main purpose of labels is to use them with break and continue to alter the usual behaviour of the loop. but it's possible to label every statement that is not a declaration...int j = 0;.label1: j++;.label2: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4 ; i++) {.    if (i == 3) break label2;.}...is there any purpose to labels like label1 since it's not allowed to break label1?
