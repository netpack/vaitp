"is there a good way to determine if a file is executable in blank i'm aware you can call ..runtime.getruntime().exec(file);...and get an exception if it is not executable, however this is unsafe since running an executable can have side effects...i guess just checking the extension is enough on windows, but is there a way i can read the executable bit on *nix file systems?..what is the best way to find out if an file is executable in the os?"
