"how to convert pdf to xml i am facing problem finding any solution for converting my pdf to html/xml.this requirement comes because i have a certificate as a pdf form.i need to make this certificate available to the user in the form of a html page(specifically using jsf). user can edit this form and can update the values.these values will be read by backing bean so that i can be saved in the database.problem is these certificates kept on changing after 3 months or so. so if i go by trivial approach of writing all the components in the html, i will be kind of hell to maintain and to change. so i want that if there is any blank utility which i can tweak so that i can render the page using xml...looking forward for the answer. .thanks in advance!!!"
