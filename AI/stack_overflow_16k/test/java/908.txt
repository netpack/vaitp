"filewriter vs fileoutputstream in blank i'm little confused about filewriter and fileoutputstream. as i see source code of filewriter there are just 4 constructors and each constructor is calling fileoutputstream's constructor. ..public filewriter(string filename) throws ioexception {.       super(new fileoutputstream(filename));.}.public filewriter(string filename, boolean append) throws ioexception {.        super(new fileoutputstream(filename, append));.}.public filewriter(file file) throws ioexception {.        super(new fileoutputstream(file));.}.public filewriter(file file, boolean append) throws ioexception {.        super(new fileoutputstream(file, append));.}.public filewriter(filedescriptor fd) {.        super(new fileoutputstream(fd));.}...after searching difference between them i found mentioned here....  fileoutputstream is meant for writing streams of raw bytes such as.  image data. for writing streams of characters, consider using.  filewriter....how filewriter can make difference? even it still calling fileoutputstream's constructor without any changing."
