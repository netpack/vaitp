"how does blank handle multiple constructors? if a class contains two constructors that take in different types of arguments as shown here:..public class planet {.   public double xxpos; //its current x position.   public double yypos; //its current y position.   public double xxvel; //its current veolicity in the x direction.   public double yyvel; //its current veolicity in the y direction.   public double mass; //its mass.   public string imgfilename; //the name of an image in the images directory that depicts the planet..   // constructor is like __init__ from python, this sets up the object when called like: planet(arguments).   public planet(double xp, double yp, double xv, double yv, double m, string img) {.      xxpos = xp;.      yypos = yp;.      xxvel = xv;.      yyvel = yv;.      mass = m;.      imgfilename = img;..   }..   // second constructor.   // how come testplanetconstructor knows to use this second one?.   // does it know based on the argument type its being passed?.   public planet(planet p) {.      xxpos = p.xxpos;.      yypos = p.yypos;.      xxvel = p.xxvel;.      yyvel = p.yyvel;.      mass = p.mass;.      imgfilename = p.imgfilename;.   }.}...my primary question is:.1) how does another class with a main that calls this class determine which constructor to use?..if that is the case, what would happen if you have two constructors with:.2) the same type and number of arguments?.3) the same type but different number of arguments?..i realize that follow up questions are something that you should probably never do (aka something messy). i am just curious."
