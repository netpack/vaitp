"creating multiple objects ""x"" distance away from each other i am trying to finish my code for an assignment i have, but i'm stuck on the last component. i need to create ""stars"" (small yellow square objects) in the ""sky""... a grid of 5 rows of 10 stars. i am in a beginner blank class, and i am supposed to being using methods such as star.movehorizontal() or star.movevertical(). all of the relevant posts i've searched for have been too complex or out of my comprehension. ..i think that i would need to create an array? we haven't even covered that in class... and then have each ""star"" be x distance (the first star) + 30 units to the right. then t continue that trend until there are 10 stars in a row. and then get four more rows of 10 stars...here is the code i've create for just one star (in the upper left of my window): ..square s1 = new square();.s1.makevisible();.s1.changecolor(""yellow"");.s1.changesize(5);.s1.movevertical(-100);.s1.movehorizontal(-270);...then i tried to create an array for a square class... i honestly have no idea if that's even legal. ..square[] stararray = new square[10];.for ( int i=0; i&lt;stararray.length; i++) {.stararray[i] = new square();...but then i don't understand how i can call each star and make them appear... please help. i feel so out of my depth. i've tried to research this and try new things for over 2.5 hours now. i will answer any questions you have to the best of my ability. thank you"
