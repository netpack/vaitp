"returning the enclosing object in a method without taking its reference name in blank. how to return the same exceuting object in a return object(same) method without taking the name of the excecuting object as a parameter. for example, suppose there is a method in a class called x(parameters) with the same return type of the class. and i created an object of the class let it be y. and i invoke this method by y.x(par). can i return y inside the method from this invocation in a special case..is there a way in the blank language to do this around other than declaring the method static and taking two paramters?..consider for the previous example a simple concatenate method...linkedlist concate(linkedlist secondlist){.if(secondlist.isempty()) return (current object);// what is the right form ??.                               // current object is a pseude code not blank's.}...thanks in advance!"
