"how to make nested loop into recursive function? is it possible to convert multiple nested for loop structure as following to a recursive function? ..void printhierarchy().{ .  for(int i=1;i&lt;4;i++).  {.      system.out.println(i);.      for(int j=1;j&lt;4;j++).      {.          system.out.println(i + ""-"" + j);.          for(int k=1;k&lt;4;k++).          {.              system.out.println(i + ""-"" + j + ""-"" + k);.          }.      }.  }.}...i am struggling with entry criteria and exit criteria for this code. and further challenge is printing the i-j-k values as these will not be recorded in recursive function call."
