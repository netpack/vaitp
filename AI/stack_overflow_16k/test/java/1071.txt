"need easy way to create comparator class used for sorting i was going through the following blank tutorial which showed how to sort on 'age' for a person object. in order to do this, you must create a class as follows:..class personagecomparator implements comparator&lt;person&gt; {.public int compare(person a, person b) {.    return a.getbirthday().compareto(b.getbirthday());.}.}...my question is, is there an easy way, such as a wizard which can generate this code for me ? i know there is a wizard which can generate hashcode and equals, but what about a comparator class used for sorting. this could really be helpful... what if we had to sort on age and name ?i would have no idea how to create that compare method on my own. a wizard could really help here."
