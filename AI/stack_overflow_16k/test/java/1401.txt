"warning: overridable method call in constructor...for getters? netbeans is giving me a ton of warnings about ...  overridable method all in constructor...and i have read up on why overridable method calls in constructors are not recommended. but the methods i have in the constructor at the moment are purely getters for the classes members...so in this case, when the override-able methods are purely getters is it alright to have them in the constructor? as i see it, i don't have much of an option, i need to initialize these variables in the constructor. i could create a private method like custominitcomponents, put my variable setting code in that and call it from the constructor... would that be considered better practice?"
