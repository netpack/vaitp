"how do i read in values for the elements of an array from a scanner passed in? for this simple program we were given 2 classes to work with mydate and duedates (and of course main class). after initializing the array of objects of mydate class private mydate [] duedates = new mydate[10], a specific function asks us to 'read in values for the dates in the array from the scanner passed in'. ..i was very confused by that, because i -as a weak programmer- have only used scanner for stuff like system.in and the like. which wasn't what i didn't understand; it was 'how' can i read in those values? since i wasn't able to use input.next() or what not as it is an array of type class...public class duedates {.    private mydate[] duedates ;..    public duedates() {.        //*****  write the code for this method here.        duedates = new mydate [10];.    }..    //set array to have size of parameter passed in.    public duedates(int max) {.        //*****  write the code for this method here.        duedates = new mydate[max];.    }..    /*reads in values for the dates in the array from the scanner passed in ------having issues here*/.    public boolean inputduedates(scanner in) {.        //*****  write the code for this method here.        in = new scanner(system.in);.        duedates = in.  // i'm lost at this point.        return true;.    }.}...public class mydate {.        private int day = 1;.        private int month = 1;.        private int year = 2018;..        public mydate() {.        }..        public string tostring() {   .            return new string ("""" + year + ""/"" + month + ""/"" + day);.        }..        public boolean inputdate(scanner in) {.            month = 0;.            day = 0; .            year = 0;.            do {..                system.out.print (""enter month - between 1 and 12: "");.                if (in.hasnextint()).                    this.month = in.nextint();.                else {.                    system.out.println (""invalid month input"");.                    in.next();.                }.            } while (this.month &lt;= 0 || this.month &gt; 12);..            do {..                system.out.print (""enter day - between 1 and 31: "");.                if (in.hasnextint()).                    this.day = in.nextint();.                else {.                    system.out.println (""invalid day input"");.                    in.next();.                }.            } while (this.day &lt;= 0 || this.day &gt; 31 || (this.month == 2 &amp;&amp; this.day &gt; 29) || (this.day &gt; 30 &amp;&amp; (this.month == 9 ||this.month == 4 ||this.month == 6 ||this.month == 11) ) );..            do {.                system.out.print (""enter year: "");.                if (in.hasnextint()).                    this.year = in.nextint();.                else {.                    system.out.println (""invalid day input"");.                    in.next();.                }.            } while (this.year &lt;= 0);..            return true;        .        }```.^^^^is what was given to us, im not sure if the prof forgot to complete the constructor or simply it needs to be empty as is, but hope this clears it up more...i can provide the other class if need be, and/or the sample output, but i'm genuinely just stuck at this point, sorry and thanks."
