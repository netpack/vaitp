"aliasing with stringbuffer i am running this code:..public class testttt {.public static void main(string[] args){.    arraylist&lt;stringbuffer&gt; listone = new arraylist &lt;stringbuffer&gt;();.       listone.add(new stringbuffer(""one""));.       listone.add(new stringbuffer(""two""));.       listone.add(new stringbuffer(""three""));..    arraylist &lt;stringbuffer&gt; listtwo = new arraylist &lt;stringbuffer&gt;(listone);.       listone.add(new stringbuffer(""four""));.       for (stringbuffer str : listtwo) {.          str.append(""2"");.       } ..    system.out.println(""list one: "" + listone);.    system.out.println(""list two: "" + listtwo);..}.}...i thought by having the ""new arraylist"" declaration when initializing listtwo i would have created a distinct array that would be independent from listone. however, the output is: ..list one: [one2, two2, three2, four].list two: [one2, two2, three2]...i have a suspicion that the listtwo initialization only copied over the references from listone, but i thought it would have been handled by the ""new arraylist"" section...any explanation would be greatly appreciated!"
