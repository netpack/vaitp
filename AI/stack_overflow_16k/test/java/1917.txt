"runtime exec doesn't execute the following command. what could be the reason? the code below doesn't work using a runtime execution in eclipse but the same works using command line execution from the root directory of the eclipse project. i have tried different commands such as creating a textfile using notepad which also works using runtime. but the below command doesn't work. is there any particular reason for it?..    runtime rt = runtime.getruntime();.    process pr = rt.exec(""dot -tpng output//vowelwithgainratio.dot &gt; output.png"");...output is the directory where the .dot file is present..the command works based on graphviz graphics visualization software."
