"using random.nextboolean() - random generator in the example below the while loops simulates a mechanic seeing 10 used engines. each engine has a 50% chance of working or not working. my variable counter keeps tracks of the number of working engines and prints it out at the end of the program. ..my question is this the correct and best possible way to use the rgen.nextboolean()? is it better to put rgen.nextboolean in method and then call that method from inside the while loop?  also, i'm a little confused how if(rgen.nextboolean()) knows it's evaluating n if you don't specifically tell the rgen.nextboolean() in the if condition that you're giving it n as a value?  ..import acm.program.*;.import acm.util.*;..public class workingengines extends consoleprogram{.public void run(){...int n = 0;.int counter = 0;..    while (n &lt; 10) {.     if (rgen.nextboolean()){.       counter++;.          }  .      n++;.      }. println(""out of ten random engines you have"" + counter + "" working properly"");. }.....private randomgenerator rgen = randomgenerator.getinstance();.}"
