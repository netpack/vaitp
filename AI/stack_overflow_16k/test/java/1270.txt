"copying a text file into a 2d char array in blank i'm working on reading a text file that contains an 5x6 character big ascii image. here's what i've done so far:..  ...    .  scanner filereader = null;.  try{.     file file = new file(filename);.     filereader = new scanner(file);.     int offset = 0;..     char [][] pic = new char[5][6];..     while (filereader.hasnextline()){.        for (int u = 0; u &lt; row; u++){.           for (int i = 0; i &lt; col; i++){.              string line = filereader.nextline();.              pic[u][i] = line.charat(offset++);.           }.        }.        return pic;.     }.     filereader.close();.  }.  catch(exception e){.     system.out.println(e.getmessage());.  }......this gives me a ""no line found"" message. i'm wondering if the scanner i use to ask the user the name of the file is a part of the problem. here's what that looks like:..  system.out.println(""hello! i load files."");.  system.out.println(""please, enter file name:"");.  scanner reader = new scanner(system.in);.  string filename = reader.nextline();...i've tried to close the reader after but it didn't change anything. any help is much appreciated."
