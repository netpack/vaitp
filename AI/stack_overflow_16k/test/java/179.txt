"blank.util.scanner cannot be resolved this is my current code which is inside a blanktogo package and a class file named console.blank...package blanktogo;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class console {..    /**.     * private static scanner for multiple use..     */..    // update: i did have system.in - i just did not copy and paste.    // the code directly from my project since it has things not needed.    private static scanner scanner = new scanner(system.in);..    /**.     * static method to return a user input..     * .     * @param line.     * @return string.     */..    public static string readline(.            string line.    ) {.        system.out.print(line);.        return scanner.nextline();.    }..}...i found the documentation to read a console input which uses the blank.util package and the scanner.blank however when i hit ctrl+shift+o to automatically import or manually import it, i get an error on the import and instance:...  scanner cannot be resolved to a type.  .  the import blank.util.scanner cannot be resolved...any help would be appreciated, i have refreshed eclipse and restarted it - i am still receiving this error...note: when i change the import to import blank.util.* i receive no further errors on the import but the scanner instance still errors...update: i took a print screen if it helps anyone...resolved because i updated my blank, i had to manually tell eclipse my jdk path...thanks to @pshemo for the answer and everyone who helped."
