"private float x = 34f, y = 34f; what does f stand for? i was reading someone's blank code and came across this declaration:..private float x = 34f, y = 34f;...what does the f stand for? i have never seen this type of declaration before. i can easily assume that it stands for ""float"" since the type is float, but that's just a wild guess...any explanation would be helpful, thanks in advance."
