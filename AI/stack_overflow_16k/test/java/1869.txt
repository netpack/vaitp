"is it good to have instance variable assigned to some value instead declared in constructor i have a class user which has instance variables with default values. like give below..public class user{.   private string username="""";.   private string password = """";.   private boolean isvaliduser = true;.   private boolean email = ""sample@gmail.com"".  ........ .}...now i have changed my class like ..public class user{.       private string username;.       private string password;.       private boolean isvaliduser;.       private boolean email.      ........ ..      public user(){.         email = ""sample@gmail.com"";.         isvaliduser = true;.         ........      }.  }...i though keeping those default values in constructor is good practice...i know it's stupid question =d but wanna know your opinion."
