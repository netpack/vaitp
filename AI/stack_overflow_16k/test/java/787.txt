"how would i sort a string list by integers in that string? *blank* i have a query.  in my blank program i have a list of strings, but i need to know how to sort them by an integer contained in the strings...for example:..arraylist&lt;string&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();...and in that list:..""personone - 1234 seconds"";.""persontwo - 5678 seconds"";...i need to sort it by the numbers in each of the strings. (there will be more items in the list)."
