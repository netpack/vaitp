"as a beginner in blank, should i be aiming to keep my code efficient? i'm a beginner in blank(under a month of self -study) and as an aspiring developer i'd like to think that this topic is something i should be well versed in(excuse me for my lack of terminology here)..here's  my code: ..public static void main(string[] args) {.    scanner reader = new scanner(system.in);.    arraylist&lt;string&gt; wordslist = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();.    while (true) {.        system.out.println(""type a word: "");.        string word = reader.nextline();.        if (word.isempty()) {.            collections.reverse(wordslist);.            system.out.println(""you typed the following words: "");.            for (string wordss : wordslist) {.                system.out.println(wordss);.            }.            break;.        }.        wordslist.add(word);.    }.}...i apologize for bad indentation...in this line:..for (string wordss: wordslist) .    print(wordss)...i believe i am creating an entirely new string array named wordss, and it is containing all the identical info of wordslist after it was being updated. would it be more efficient to write a loop that prints out each of the words in the wordslist array rather than allocating more space for another array?(please correct my ignorance where necessary) is it a better practice to be more simple with my code?..my other question is that i have my loop running an if check after every time a new word is input. i also believe that this is inefficient - so would it be better to simply move the check to after the words are added?..thanks a lot!"
