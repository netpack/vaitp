"copying a 2d array into a bigger array i have a two dimensional array, e.g. string array[][] = {{"""","""","""","""","""",},{"""","""","""","""","""",}}. this array is full and i want to resize it. so since arrays are fixed in size, i want to copy this array into a new, bigger array. ...  also, i searched around the site and found that i can use system.arraycopy() and other methods but i prefer only using for loops. i was thinking a couple of for loops will suffice. ...what i tried was: ..string[][] newarray;.  for(int i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++) {.    for(int j=0; j&lt;array[i].length; j++).      newarray[i][j]=array[i][j];.      system.out.println(newarray[i][j]);.      system.out.println();.    }...but i keep getting a compiling error saying error: cannot find symbol j?..also, i get the message variable newarray might not have been initialized. does newarray must be initialized because i don't know what the size of it will be after my code is finished?"
