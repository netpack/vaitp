"how to mock a local static variable? my class uses a static local variable of org.slf4j.logger. is there some clever way of replacing this with a mock object for my testing? i'm thinking my best option is for myclass to expose a setter? ..also, how can i mock the logger object? i'd like to mock it such that when logger.error(string, exception) is called i'd like to validate the error string...public class myclass {.  private static logger logger = loggerfactory.getlogger(myclass.class);"
