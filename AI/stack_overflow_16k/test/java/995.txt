"how do i make the nosuchelementexception not show up and replace it with my own error message so what i am supposed to do it have this code search through the file names.txt (contains about a thousand baby names and their rankings from 1900 to now) for the name that             i type in and have the program print out the name and the rankings. .   if the name does not exist in the file, it is supposed to print out something like ""name not found"" or whatever. .   my problem is that it either prints out 'name not found' about 2k times before it finds the name, or it jsut prints out 'name not found' for every year until i get to the last name and it realizes it's not there. it then prints out the cpu generated error..   i also am not supposed to have the error just be the computer generated error. .please help. ..import blank.util.scanner;.import blank.io.*;..public class babynames {.    public static void main(string[] args).            throws filenotfoundexception {.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.        scanner reader = new scanner(new file(""names.txt""));.        string findnameoriginal = "" "";.        string findname = "" "";.        int space = 0;.        int rank = 0;.        int year = 1900;.        system.out.println(""this program graphs the popularity of a name in 11 decades' worth of statistics recorded since the year 1900."");.        system.out.print(""type a name: "");.        string name = input.next();.        system.out.println(""npopularity ranking of name """" + name + """""");..        while (!findname.equalsignorecase(name)) {.            findnameoriginal = reader.nextline();.            scanner nameline = new scanner(findnameoriginal);.            space = findnameoriginal.indexof("" "");.            findname = nameline.next();.            for (year = 1900; year &lt;= 2000; year += 10) {.                rank = nameline.nextint();.                if (findname.equalsignorecase(name)) {.                    system.out.println(year + "": "" + rank);.                } else {.                    system.out.println(""name not found"");..                }..            }.        }.    }.}...(not sure if this link to the names and data will work).http://fcps.blackboard.com/@@/3773575e3802f997e96cecf10e46ca25/courses/1/030-1-348-31840002-1314-yr/content/_27024448_1/names.txt"
