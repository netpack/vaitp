"why ""keyboard.readdouble()"" doesn't work? all i want it to do is read input typed by the user as double type, and then convert it to another number. i'm also aware the equation isn't complete, not worried about that right now, just want it to run. i don't understand what i have done wrong. ..public class euroshoe {...    public static void main(string[] args) {..        double.        footlength,.        eurosize;..        system.out.println(""european shoe size"");.        system.out.println(""enter the length of your foot in inches:"");.        footlength = keyboard.readdouble();     // line 25.        eurosize = (((footlength - 9) * 3 / 2) + 15);.        system.out.println(""your european shoe size is "" + eurosize);.    }...}"
