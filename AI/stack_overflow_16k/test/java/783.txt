"storing values by negative index i am actually working on a chunk system for my infinity size world map,.and i just realized that i will use negative x and y coordinates...so, my question is what would be the best solution for storing an infinity amount of chunk objects indexed by x and y...up until now i was using this:..arraylist&lt;arraylist&lt;chunk&gt;&gt; chunks = new arraylist&lt;arraylist&lt;chunk&gt;&gt;();.//....chunk = chunks.get(x).get(y);.version = chunks.get(x).get(y).getversion();...but when negative indexes kick in, the whole concept just failed."
