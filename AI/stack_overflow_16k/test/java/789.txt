"listening to key presses in blank without a ui component i am trying to write what can best be surmised as a script to click a button on a browser many times without stopping. i can do key presses ad infinitum fine using the blank.awt.robot class but the problem i'm having is coding the correct activator/interruptor; i don't know how to make blank listen to keyboard commands (i want to start/stop when i press f3) without using a listener, which in turn needs to be added to a ui component, if i am not mistaken. how do i do this? currently i have:..    public static void main(string[] args) throws exception.    {.       final robot robot = new robot();.            robot.delay(10000);.            while (true).            {.                robot.mousepress(inputevent.button1_mask);.                robot.delay(1000);.                robot.mouserelease(inputevent.button1_mask);.            }.     }   ...i realize it's probably very simple in jython or groovy, but i am curios nonetheless."
