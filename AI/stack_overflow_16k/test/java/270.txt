"blank hierarchical object connection this is the structure i have at the moment: ..map&lt;string,map&lt;collection&lt;item&gt;,map&lt;string,collection&lt;item&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...so i have : lots of strings, that each is linked to lots of items, that each has lots of strings, that each hold lots of items...it is rather confusing, is there something liked a linkedlist, that can hold different types of data in this hierarchical way?..one way to do it is to create an object, but i will be using this variable only once in my massive code, don't want to make a class for that."
