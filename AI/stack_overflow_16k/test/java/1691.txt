"singleton collection to multiple object collection so i was initially using a singleton list to pass data to google cloud api like this:..inputinput.setcsvinstance(collections.&lt;object&gt;singletonlist(""ear""));...how can i change the singletonlist to send multiple objects like this:..inputinput.setcsvinstance(collections.&lt;object&gt;singletonlist(""5.656346"", ""2.43485744"", ...));...edit: i don't want to keep a singleton. i need to change it to multiple one, singleton doesn't allow me that. what keyword should i use instead of singleton is my question...thanks."
