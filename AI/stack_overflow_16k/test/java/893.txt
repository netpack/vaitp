"how to override tostring() properly in blank? sounds a little stupid, but i need help on my tostring() method and it is very irking. .i tried looking up online because the tostring is the one where it is screwing up and ""not finding kid constructor #2"" even though it is there and i would even do something else and it doesn't work..ok that was a lot so here is my code: ..import blank.util.*; .   class kid {  .      string name; .      double height; .      gregoriancalendar bday; ..      public kid () { .         this.name = ""head"";.         this.height = 1; .         this.bday = new gregoriancalendar(1111,1,1); .      } ..      public kid (string n, double h, string date) {.      // method that tostring() can't find somehow.         stringtokenizer st = new stringtokenizer(date, ""/"", true);.         n = this.name;.         h = this.height;.      } ..      public string tostring() { .         return kid(this.name, this.height, this.bday);.      } .   } //end class ...ok so my tostring above (i know, my third parameter is off, should be a string) is off. if i hardcode a value in for the third thing it goes haywire and says it can't find this (up above). so how can i get the date and break it up?..class calling this is below..class driver {   .   public static void main (string[] args) {   .      kid kid1 = new kid(""lexie"", 2.6, ""11/5/2009"");   .      system.out.println(kid1.tostring());.   } //end main method .} //end class  ...i tried researching multiple constructors and it really didn't help..i tried researching tostring() methods, and tried using previous tostring() methods logic that i created previous but this is brand new so it never worked...help?"
