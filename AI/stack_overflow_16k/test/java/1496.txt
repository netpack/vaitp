"dynamically calling methods on interface i'm a newbie in blank programming and i'm trying to write simple mxbean servlet..i want to to dump some data from runtimemxbean...as you know, there are couple methods for this interface, fe:.- getvmname.- getvmvendor.and more....i would like to create some array with couple method names and later use foreach to call one-by-one and print its value...unfortunately it does not work for me..i tried obj.invoke, getmethod and nothing - looks like it does not work like regular class or something (sorry, i'm noob)..some code:..runtimemxbean rmx = managementfactory.getruntimemxbean();...if i use rmx.getvmvendor() all is fine, but i don't know how can i use (maybe something else?) invoke method with string name on this object (needed for loop).i'm using latest netbeans with glassfish...thank you."
