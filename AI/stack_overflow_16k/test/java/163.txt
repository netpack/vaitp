"is there any easy way to set several bits in a row within a short or int? i am trying to find an easy way of setting several bits within an integer or a short value...for a short value i want to set 5 bits, starting at bit number 6..the value i want to set is a certain value i can store in a byte or short or whatever...for the blank setbits, i do not see anything where you can do something like this..it seems like there should be an easy to do this...does anybody know of an easy way of doing this besides setting one bit at a time or something like that?"
