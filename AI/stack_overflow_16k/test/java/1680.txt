"generate random array of letters/numbers, but can't use the same letter/number twice very similar to generating unique random numbers in blank. but with letters and numbers, not just numbers...so how would i go about 'generate random array of letters/numbers, but can't use the same letter/number twice'. so for example:..good:.""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"".""qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm0246813579"".bad:.""aacddfghhjklmmopprstuvvwxy2335925523""..it needs to contain every letter in the alphabet, but only once and in a random order."
