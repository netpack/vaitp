"blank how to print the original index of a sorted 2d array? suppose i have a 5x1 2d array [2,3,1,4,5], so the index would be .[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0]] still, but how to have the original index stay in the value? so then i can print out the index after sorting the value (if that make sense), example..after sorting the value will be [1,2,3,4,5], but the index would be [2,0][0,0][1,0][3,0][4,0] how exactly do you manipulate it?.thanks in advance, help will be much appreciated!..{. int[][] array = new int[5][1];.. array = {{2,3,1,4,5}};. //at this point the array index will be [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0]].. arrays.sort(array);. //i want the index to stay within the value after sorting.....}"
