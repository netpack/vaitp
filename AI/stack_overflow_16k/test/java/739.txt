"how to change a method's behavior according to the application which is calling it? i have a common jar that uses some unmarshaling of a string object. the method should act differently depending on which application it is called from, how can i do that besides from the fact that i can identify the application by trying to load some unique class it has (don't like that). is there some design pattern that solves this issue?"
