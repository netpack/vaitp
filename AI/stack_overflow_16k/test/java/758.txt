"convert strings with float value only i have an external text file named mytext.txt. i'm reading that file in blank and trying to extract out the float values only. the value and sentence in the text file may vary. this is what i have so far:..myfile.txt content:..harry have 21.00pounds. 11/25/2009 is my birthday....and my code is..for(int k = 1; k &lt; mytextwords.length; k++){.    string s = mytextwords[k];.    try{.        float f = float.valueof(s.trim()).floatvalue();.        system.out.println(""float f = "" + f);.    }.    catch (numberformatexception nfe){.        system.err.println(""numberformatexception: "" + nfe.getmessage());.    }.} ...the problem is:...the 21.00 is printed as ..float f = 21.0..11/25/2009 is also converted to string and printed as ..float f = 11.0.float f = 25.0.float f = 2009.0 ....how can restrict the program to extract and convert only strings that are like 21.00, 190.20...**content of the text value may vary, not fixed."
