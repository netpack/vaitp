"invoking a constructor with a file as an argument i have a class spellingsuggestor, whose constructor has the signature ....public spellingsuggestor(file file) throws ioexception { // something }..i want to invoke its constructor from another class. the code goes something like this ..public class nlpapplications.    public static void main(string[] args) {    .        string w= ""randomword"";.        url url = getclass().getresource(""big.txt"");.        file file = new file(url.getpath());..        system.out.println((new spellingsuggestor(file)).correct(w));   .    }.}...but the above shows error in the url url.. line saying...url cannot be resolved to a type..cannot make a static reference to the non-static method getclass() from the type object....what is going wrong ? ....i looked at this question  how to pass a text file as a argument?. i am not comfortable with handling files in blank and so this question."
