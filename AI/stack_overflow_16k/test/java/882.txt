"read into a string (blank) i'm trying to read a text file into a one single string with the following code:..try {.        scanner input = new scanner (new file (""data.txt""));.        while (input.hasnextline()) {.           string += input.nextline();.        }.    } catch (filenotfoundexception e) {.        // todo auto-generated catch block.        e.printstacktrace();.    }...this works when the file is really small. my file is around 20 kb and it just doesn't read. i don't get any errors. what should i do? i need to read it into one string."
