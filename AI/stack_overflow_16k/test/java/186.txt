"blank new date() in print just learning blank and i know this may sound stupid but i have to ask. ..system.out.print(new date());...i know that whatever is in the argument is converted to a string, the end value that is, .new date() returns a reference to a date object. so how is it that it prints this?..mon aug 29 13:22:03 bst 2011...the only thing i can think of is somehow the function parses through all the data members gets their values converts them to a string and prints them...if not how does it work? ..thanks"
