"how to store the result of compilation (using blankc) to a text file? suppose i want to compile the hello world program. i use the general blankc hello_world.blank. however in cmd, it shows ""semicolon is missing"" compilation error. ..how do i store this compilation error into a text file ? or even a string will do. how do i ""catch"" this error ? my mentor suggested something like :..""blankc filename.blank 2 > textfile.txt "" ..but i cannot find anything even remotely similar on the web."
