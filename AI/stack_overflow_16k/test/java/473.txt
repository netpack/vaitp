"get track by its unique id to remove it .  i am currently working on a train simulation project and i am having some trouble with the delete track &lt;id&gt; command..  .  her is my execute() method for the command:...public void execute(list&lt;string&gt; args) throws badsyntaxexception {.    if (args.size() != 1) { throw new illegalargumentexception(""invalid number of .    arguments.""); }..    int trackid = integer.parseint(args.get(0));..    register.removetrack(*);.}...now, i need to somehow get the track to be removed by its unique id for *...here is my constructor of track.blank:..public track(int id, point startpoint, point endpoint) { ... }...and this is in the class where i register everything:..private list&lt;track&gt; tracks;.private idtracker trackids;...my solution approach so far:..public track gettrack(int id) {.    for (track track : tracks) {.        if (track.getid() == id) {.            return track;.        }.    }.}...but what do i return if the track with the given id doesn't exist? there is probably a more efficient way than doing it like this. can someone help me out?"
