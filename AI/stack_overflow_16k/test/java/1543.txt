"what happens when there is synchronization block around the usage of an object only in one place? class a {.    private map&lt;oject,object&gt; map;.    public void clear() {.        map.clear();.    }..    public void work() {.        synchronized (map) {.            map.put(new object, new object();.        }.    }.}...if thread a is in the middle of the work() method, does this mean thread b won't block if executing the clear() method?..what is the difference between the code above and having this?..    public void clear() {.        synchronized (map) {.            map.clear();.        }.    }"
