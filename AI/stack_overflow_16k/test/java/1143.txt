"how to do blank web development without a local environment i started a new job recently. i've been a blank &amp; xml web developer for two years. the new place i'm at has several large web applications, but none of them deploy to my local jboss server because some genius decided to create a blank project instead of a dynamic web project. i tried following the steps to convert the project but that creates a bunch of errors which i cannot resolve...the people i work with are all consultants and never give me a straight answer on how i can develop/test my changes locally...has anyone had to program in a similar situation? if so... got any advice?"
