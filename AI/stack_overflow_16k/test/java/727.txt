"list containing another list i have an object in my application, customer, that has a list of customers.   ..public class customerlist.{.private list&lt;customer&gt;.}...the customer class in turn has a list of all the items they have shopped at a store on a given day of the week... public class customer.{.private list&lt;string&gt; itemsonmonday;.private list&lt;string&gt; itemsontuesday;.private list&lt;string&gt; itemsonwednesday;.private list&lt;string&gt; itemsonthursday;.private list&lt;string&gt; itemsonfriday;.}...now, i want to get the list of all the items the customer has shopped in a given week. what is the best way to do this? my colleague suggests i create another list, and add items to this list. i am not convinced this is a good approach. i have over 1000 customers, and each customer shops over 500 items/week. he suggests something like this -..for(customer customer:customerlist).{.list&lt;string&gt; items = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();.items.addall(itemsonmonday);.//so on until friday..}...this is crazy, because i would end up creating over 1000 objects inside the for loop. any thoughts on a better way to do this? we have been brain storming for a while now, and can't come up with an efficient implementation to achieve this. any help will be much appreciated."
