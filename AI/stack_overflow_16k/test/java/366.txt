blank instanciate class from method object to invoke (blank reflection) so i am using this code statement to receive all methods that are annotated with a given annotation:..set&lt;method&gt; resources = reflections.getmethodsannotatedwith(annotation);...so these methods come from different classes...what i want is to be able to use that collection later to invoke each of these functions like that:..for (method method : resources) {.      // declaration of instance missing here.      method.invoke(instance);.}...the issue i am facing now is how can i create an instance of the class the method is originally coming from? does the method object even contain information on its class?..apprecciate any help.
