"character comparison i'm currently doing an online course, however it doesn't seem to enjoy this method: character.iswhitespace(c)..what other methods are there that can answer the below question?..assume that c is a char variable has been declared and already given a value. write an expression whose value is true if and only if x is what is called a whitespace character (that is a space or a tab or a newline-- none of which result in ink being printed on paper)."
