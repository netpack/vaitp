"mypoint blank not working with user input hi i have to write a program that creates the two points and calculates the distance between them ... i have written the program but not i have to do it with user input .... can someone please tell me where i am going wrong ?..class mypoint {..    private double x;.    private double y;..    public double getx().    {.        return x;.    }.    public double gety().    {.        return y;.    }.    public mypoint().    {..    }..    public mypoint(double x, double y).    {.         this.x = x;.         this.y = y;.    }.    public double distance(mypoint secondpoint) {.        return distance(this, secondpoint);.      }..      public static double distance(mypoint p1, mypoint p2) {.        return math.sqrt((p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y).            * (p1.y - p2.y));.      }.}..public class mypointtest.{.    public static void main(string[] args).        {.           mypoint p1 = new mypoint(0,0);.           mypoint p2 = new mypoint(10, 30.5);.           p1.distance(p2);.           system.out.println(""distance between two points (0,0) and (10,30.5)= ""+mypoint.distance(p1,p2));.        }.}...this is what i have tried with user input ..import blank.util.scanner;.public class testmypoint {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.        mypoint p1 = new mypoint();.            mypoint p2 = new mypoint();.        system.out.print(""enter a  first point  "" + p1 );.        system.out.print(""enter a  second point  "" + p2 );.        system.out.println(p1.distance(p2));.        system.out.println(mypoint.distance(p1, p2));..    }..}"
