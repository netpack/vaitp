"how do i fetch and display data from various website apis? i'm learning blank and c++. i would also like to learn how to get data from websites like google (analytics, gmail, plans, etc.) facebook, twitter, etc., and display it on my website. ..for instance: i'd like to be able to access, from google analytics, how many people visited my website, their locations, os, etc., then display it on my website.  ..or to be able to post comments or delete them on my business facebook page directly from my personal webpage. or at least see if there's new activity on facebook directly from my personal website...i tried to understand oauth and google apis through google's tutorials, but the information on their pages are just as messy and scattered as their android's guides...i don't even know what languages i should learn to do something like this. i don't know what to search for in the net...is there a term for this kind of process? is this the same as data mining? i tried to search google, but couldn't find anything that could help me, as a beginner...is there a book for beginners, with clear information? perhaps a youtube channel with tutorials? where do i begin here?..edit:..maybe they are not language dependent, but there should be a way to learn how to implement them using a language like blank, for example. this is  what i cannot find...and yes, i am asking for functionalities found in websites’ apis, and each one is different, but they must make some sense, because if people can make it work, it’s because they’d learn it somehow. i guess i am asking how to learn to make sense of these apis...i do not know where to start, because the tutorials on facebook, google, etc., they all seem to assume some kind of previous knowledge. google searches has been proving unfruitful as well...i’m not asking for a step-by-step; this would be ludicrous, given the complexity of the issue. what i am asking, however, is for guided directions. i don’t know what to study, i don’t know the name of the process so i can search for it more effectively, i can’t seem to find any books about it, nothing."
