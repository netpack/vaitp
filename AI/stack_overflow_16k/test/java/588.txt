"blank - charat with multiple answers i'm having some trouble with my code, i am trying to test if a position in a char is equal to an integer. the way i have it setup is like so:..    for(int i = 0; i &lt; str.length(); i++) {.        if(str.charat(i) == '[1234567890]') {.            system.out.println(str);.        }.    }...however i'm getting the error ""unclosed character literal"" when i try to compile. does anyone know why i'm getting an error, or can explain a more simple way to do this?"
