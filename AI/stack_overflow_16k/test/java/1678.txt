"removing duplicates in an arraylist just a disclaimer: i repeated my blank mod for the second time so my questions may tend to be a bit simple and hopefully i don't sound too stupid....  write a method removeduplicates that takes as a parameter a sorted.  arraylist of strings and that eliminates any duplicates from the list..  for example, suppose that a variable called list contains the.  following values: {""be"", ""be"", ""is"", ""not"", ""or"", ""question"", ""that"",.  ""the"", ""to"", ""to""} after calling removeduplicates(list); the list.  should store the following values: {""be"", ""is"", ""not"", ""or"", ""question"", ""that"", ""the"", ""to""}.  .  because the values will be sorted, all of the duplicates will be grouped together....my attempt at this:..public static void removeduplicates(arraylist &lt;string&gt;a){.    for(int i=0;i&lt;a.size();i++){.        string word=a.get(i);.        string word2=a.get(i+1);..        if(word.equals(word2)){.            a.remove(word);..        }.        else{.            system.out.print(word);..        }.    }.}...the issue is that when i call it with:..[""duplicate"", ""duplicate"", ""duplicate"", ""duplicate"", ""duplicate""]...it returns indexoutofbound. i understand it has something to do with i=i-1 with reference to the remove method. tried inserting it here and there but it doesn't work. but i am very puzzled as this works with my code. when i call it with:..[""be"", ""be"", ""is"", ""not"", ""or"", ""question"", ""that"", ""the"", ""to"", ""to""]...it works."
