"how we are able to access private instance variable with getter and setter? for the following piece of code i am trying to implement encapsulation...have a doubt, if we have made the instance variables of the class dog as private, how are we able to return the instance variable name in the getname method? as per my understanding, we cannot access a private instance variable outside the class in which it was created...can somebody explain how we are able to access the value of name instance variable?..test method:..public class testencapsulationold{..    public static void main (string [] args) {..    dog d = new dog();..    d.setage(5);.    d.setname(""tuffy"");..    system.out.println (d.getname()+""'s age is ""+d.getage());   .    }.}...class dog:..class dog {..    private int age;.    private string name;.    public void setname (string n) {.        name = n;   .    }..    public string getname() {.        return name;.    }..    public void setage (int a) {..        if (a &lt;= 0){.            system.out.println (""invalid age!!"");.        }..        else if (a&gt;20){.            system.out.println (""a dog cant live that long"");.        }..        else{.        age = a;.        }.    }..    public int getage() {.        return age;.    }.}"
