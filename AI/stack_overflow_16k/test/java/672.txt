"blank: am i allowed to use a string that is stored in a temp storage as a variable name? so i want to draw multiple things so i am writing a method that accepts strings. ..i'm not really sure how to do this or if this is even legal. also if there is a better way of doing this please let me know. i have to draw more than 10000 cubes so i don't really want to type it our that much times. ..so here's what i am thinking, ..i have a method that draws thing that takes in a string...public void drawcube(string s).{.  box s = new box(10, 10, 10);.}...and then have some kind of for loop that calls this method every time, concatenating the i into some name for how much i need to call this. ..i know that this is wrong since s is already used. how would i use the stored string of s for the name instead of s itself? ..is this possible or not?..and is there a better way of doing this?"
