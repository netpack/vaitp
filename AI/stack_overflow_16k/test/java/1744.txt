"excluding specific integer from blank method return i'm just starting blank, and have written a simple program for returning factors of input numbers. there are two classes, a tester and a the one you see below...unfortunately, my output, say if i input 150, is 2, 3, 0, 5, 5. ..i know why this is happening; when the local variable q = i, we obviously get 2, 3, 5, 5, but when the conditional in the first if statement is not met, q is read as 0...is there a way to exclude a specific integer, in this case 0, from the output? i've struggled with what should be an easy problem for hours, so obviously i'm not seeing something...i realize there are easier ways to write this program, but all methods must remain as is.....public class factorgenerator {..    private int y;.    private int i;...    public factorgenerator(int numbertofactor).    {.        y = numbertofactor;.        i = 2;.    }..    public boolean hasmorefactors().    {.        if (i &lt;= y).        {.            return true;.        }.        else.        {.            return false;.        }.    }..    public int nextfactor().    {..        int q=0;..        if( y % i != 0).            i++;..        if( y % i == 0).            {.                y = y / i;.                q = i;.            }           .        return q;.    }   .}"
