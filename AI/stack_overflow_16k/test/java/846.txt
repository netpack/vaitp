"how to initialize to ""intertwined"" objects in blank at the same time? i'm currently working on a blank school project aimed at linking a blank application to a database..we have to use the typical example of a school modelisation, composed of 3 classes:.-teacher.-student.-subject..each class a it's number of arguments, but the problem that i have is that there is an object of the subject class in a teacher (called speciality), and an object of the teacher class in a subject(called incharge), knowing that a subject is the speciality of is incharge teacher...i have to initialize an arraylist of teacher, and i'm trying to do it as follows:..while (rset.next()){.    prof **toinsert** = new teacher(rset.getint(""num_prof""),.                             rset.getstring(""nom_prof""),.                             rset.getstring(""prenom_prof""),.                             rset.getstring(""adr_prof""),.                             rset.getstring(""cp_prof""),.                             rset.getstring(""ville_prof""),.                             **new subject**(rset.getstring(""code""),.                                        rset.getstring(""libelle""),.                                        rset.getint(""h_cours-prev""),.                                        rset.getint(""h_cours_rea""),.                                        rset.getint(""h_tp_prev""),.                                        rset.getint(""h_tp_rea""),.                                        rset.getstring(""discipline""),.                                        rset.getint(""coeff_cc""),.                                        rset.getint(""coeff_test""),.                                        **toinsert**);.    listeprof.add(i, toinsert);.    ++i;.}...my teacher class constructor looks like this:..public teacher(..., subject speciality){.    ....    m_speciality = speciality;.}...my subject class constructor looks like this:..public subject(..., teacher incharge){.    ....    m_incharge = incharge;.}...as you can see, my problem here is that the constructor of the subject i want to create to be the speciality of the toinsert teacher needs to use this said teacher..is there a way to do both initialization of the objects at the same time, or should i create both objects separately, then bind them to each other using setters?..sorry for french parts in the code, i tried to translate only the part where help is needed, and thanks in advance for yout answers ^^"
