"what tools are out there to audit changes to blank interfaces? does anyone know of any tools out there which can summarize changes to blank interfaces between different versions?  (by interface i mean the exposed functionality of types in general, not the specific language construct.)..what i would like is some program which takes two versions of the same package or package tree and outputs something like:...constructor (string, int) removed on class thing.constructor (string) deprecated on class otherthing.method void setid(string) added on class somethingelse...or something more sophisticated, the above is just my initial thoughts.  a solution could work on bytecode or on source, i don't mind."
