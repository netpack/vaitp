"checking whether a string conforms to a printf-style format i'm developing a program which needs to find files from across multiple folders based on a pattern. previously, i've been working under the assumption that each filename consists of a prefix followed by an underscore and a number, but this is no longer the case. i need some way of allowing a user to enter a pattern (probably in printf format), and checking whether strings in a list conform to the given pattern, like test_%d.tif. any help would be much appreciated."
