"string index out of range - why is this occurring? (please keep in mind i have only been studying blank for under a month on my own)..i am trying to make a program that simply tells you the last char of the name you give the program. here is my code:..import blank.util.scanner;...public class lastcharacter {...public static void main(string[] args) {.    scanner reader = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.println(""hey"");.    string name = reader.nextline();.    lastchar(name);.}..public static char lastchar(string text) {.    char lastchar = '0';;.    int i = 0;.    for (i = 0; i &lt;= text.length(); i++) {.        lastchar = text.charat(i);..    }.    system.out.println(lastchar);.    return lastchar;.}...}..error: .exception in thread ""main"" blank.lang.stringindexoutofboundsexception: string index out of range: 4.at blank.lang.string.charat(string.blank:658).at lastcharacter.lastchar(lastcharacter.blank:19).at lastcharacter.main(lastcharacter.blank:11)...blank result: 1..i also know this can be made by subtracting the length of the string by 1, however i would like to know why this method isn't working. i don't really know how to word this but do strings and chars not get along? (pls dont make fun of me)..thanks!"
