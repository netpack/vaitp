why does system.out.print on null object work? let's consider following code:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    integer i = null;.    object o = null;..    system.out.println(i);.    system.out.println(o);..    system.out.println(i.tostring());.    system.out.println(o.tostring());.}...that's quite obvious that last two prints will cause nullpointerexception. one can't call method on null object. .the question is why first two prints work? aren't they calling tostring() as well?
