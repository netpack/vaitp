"trim all strings elements in a complex object can i write a generic method to trim all strings within an complex object (object containing other objects)? should blank reflection api be used to achieve this?thanks...i have provided a sample below. however in reality there could be multiple objects within objects. each object might contain a collection of string or collection of other objects which may contain string. is there a way to trim the strings - ones directly with the objects and ones within collection...public class school{.   private list&lt;course&gt; courses;.   private list&lt;student&gt; students;       .   // getters and setters.}..public class course{.   private string name;.   private string xxx;.   private string yyy;.   private list&lt;string&gt; zzzlist;.}..public class student{.   private map&lt;string,string&gt; xxx;.   private list&lt;course&gt; courselist;.}"
