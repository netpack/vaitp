"is it possible to recreate blank bufferedreader object, after close() i created an bufferedreader object to read a file. after completing the file operation successfully i am closing the object something like this:..bufferedreader buffer = new bufferedreader(new filereader(""filename""));.     //some file operation.buffer.close();...now i need create another bufferedreader object in the same program and so i wanted to create one anther bufferedreader object with the same name (i need to create object with the same name because i want to run the code recursively under some conditions )...when i tried, i am getting a message that the object is already present with the same name, even when i close() the object...can somebody please guide me how to implement this? is there a way to delete the object reference and not just closing it?.question can be silly but i haven't work one blank part till now and i can say i am new to it...thanks is advance!..error screenshot:....what i am doing is: ..  bufferedreader buffer = new bufferedreader(new filereader(""$propfilepath/webandservice-test.details""));.        //code to read the file and assigning values to some variables.  buffer.close();..  bufferedreader buffer = new bufferedreader(new filereader(""$propfilepath/projectdependencies-test.list""));.        //code to use those variables and perform operation on new read file..  buffer.close();...and getting error message, shown in screenshot."
