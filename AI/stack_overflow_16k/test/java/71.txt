"null objects in arrays of objects blank i am getting the error exception in thread “main” blank.lang.nullpointerexception?. on my program. what i did was create an array of objects (the array is dbase[], the object is employee). the employee object creates more objects (date, name, and address) that have setter and getter methods. i am getting this error when tryinig to access these object's getter methods when trying to use something such as dbase[0].date.getmonth. i believe this is something wrong with creating the array. i have not included the date or address classes in the interest of saving space, because are basically the same as the name class. thanks for the help...edit: the error occurred at the second line of the printing block in the main method in the for loop. it occurs at dbase[j].name.getfirst() at line 28..public class test {.public static void main (string[] args) {.    int i = input.getint (""how many employees would you like to enter?
