"how can i return the next for loop item for this method? i am working on this method where as you can see i have the for loop, but what i want to do is return the next item each time where this method is called (next name). but for the last return statement i am not sure what to put?..i have this so far:..public string getchoseninputfilenames() {..setnames();..for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.size(); i++) {..    if (i == 0) {.        return string.valueof(i);.    } else {.        return string.valueof(i + 1);.    }.}.return null;...}..basically, i want to keep returning the next arraylist item each time, where i call this method. any help would be much appreciated!"
