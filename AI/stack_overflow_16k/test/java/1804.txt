"what would the condition be? i'm trying to make a program that asks a user for two numbers. i want to determine how many times a certain value appear in the sequence of numbers. for instance, if user entered 10 and 20 the number ""1"" would appear 9 times. what i am wondering is what condition would i have to set to see how many times the number ""1"" would appear...this is what i got so far.....system.out.println(""enter a number: "");.    int no1 = scan.nextint();.    system.out.println(""enter a number: "");.    int no2 = scan.nextint();..    int i;.    int j = 0;..    for(i = no1; i &lt;= no2; i++){.        if(){                      // some condition here.            j++;.        }.    }.    system.out.println(j);.}...any other tips and tricks on how to make my code efficient would also be greatly appreciated."
