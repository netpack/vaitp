"blank sdk10: is cast explicitly required? i'm working through a blank book based on jdk 8. in the chapter about inheritance and generalisation the following example is shown:..class a {}.class b extends a {}.class c1 extends b { public void x1() {system.out.println(""c1.x1"");} }.class c2 extends b { public void x2() {system.out.println(""c2.x2"");} }...then, some object variables are declared, all of type a:..a obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4;...these variables are populated with instances of the four classes:..obj1 = new a();.obj2 = new b();.obj3 = new c1();.obj4 = new c2();...now, obj3.x1() doesn't work because obj3 is of type a, and x1() is not defined in a. in the book, now one can declare a new variable obj5 of type c1 and assign to it the value of obj3:..c1 obj5 = obj3; // then obj5.x1() should work...however on this line i get an incompatible types compile error...is this different between sdk8 and 10? or am i missing some error somewhere?..as a side note: casting such as in c1 obj5 = (c1) obj3 works."
