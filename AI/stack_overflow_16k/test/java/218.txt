"run jar file with arguments without having to use command line i am using alpn-boot to add support for http.2 requests using okhttp. in order for that to work i always have to launch my compiled jar file through the command line and specify the path of alpn-boot.jar file with a &lt;-xbootclasspath&gt; argument :..blank -jar -xbootclasspath/p:&lt;path_to_alpn-boot.jar&gt; &lt;path_to_myjar.jar&gt;..is there anyway to avoid this, and make the jar run with the -xbootclasspath argument specified by default? ..edit: i thought about using a batch file to do this, but is there no other native way?"
