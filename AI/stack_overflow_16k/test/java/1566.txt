"way to get number of digits from a long using modulos my ta told me that if i want to count the length of a long variable i can create a method using modulos. from what i understood he was saying that i need to keep using modulos until the long is 0. here's what i'm thinking right now, but i'm pretty lost. ..public static int inputsize(long cc_num).{.  int count = 0;.  while( cc_num &gt; 0) .    {.     count += 1;.     cc_num = cc_num % 10;.    }.}"
