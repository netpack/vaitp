"byte[] may expose internal representation of the returning reference - findbug i'm working in an old project with some old code and findbug is giving the following error with a byte[]. ...  findbugs: may expose internal representation by incorporating.  reference to mutable object this code stores a reference to an.  externally mutable object into the internal representation of the.  object.Â  if instances are accessed by untrusted code, and u nchecked.  changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other.  important properties, you will need to do something different. storing.  a copy of the object is better approach in many situations....i'm wondering if someone could help me to understand the proper way to handle this error?..private byte[] filecontent;..public fileupload(string filename, string fileextension, long filesize, byte[] filecontent, boolean attachedtopo, boolean programowner) {.        this.filename = filename;.        this.fileextension = fileextension;.        this.filesize = filesize;.        this.filecontent = filecontent;.        this.attachedtopo = attachedtopo;.        this.programowner = programowner;.    }..public byte[] getfilecontent() {.    return filecontent;.}..public void setfilecontent(byte[] filecontent) {.    this.filecontent = filecontent;.}...edit.i understand why the bug exist and i know how to deal with this when it comes to dates etc. i'm just a little confused with how to deal with it when it comes to byte[]."
