"best way to send ""messages"" from php to blank on the same workstation what is the best way to send ""messages"" from php script to blank program in real time. php script and blank programs are both working at the same work station with os windows. maybe some kind of client/server? the main feature is real time; that's why i don't want to use files...ps: i'm going to send logger messages (php) and display (blank) them at os system tray tooltip..pps: i'm real noob in blank; it will be my first blank program. :)..thank you."
