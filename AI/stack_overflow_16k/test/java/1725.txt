"blank cannot return my variable from inherated class to super class i have a superclass and an inherited class that's inheriting a variable called ""answer""... i modify that variable in my inherted class but when i try to display it back in my super class it does not work! tried multiple ways, now i am losing my mind! ..  class righttriangle{.  public double answer;..  public righttriangle(){} ;..  public double getanswer(){return answer;} ..  public double returnanswer(){.     this.answer = answer;.     return answer;.  }.  public string tostring(){.     return (""answer: "" + answer);.  }.. }..class sideangle extends righttriangle{.  public double nintydegree = 90;.  private double sidea;.  private double angleb;.  private double answerupdate;..  public sideangle(double sidea, double angleb){ .     this.sidea = sidea;.     this.angleb = angleb; .  }..  public void solveequation(){.     angleb = math.toradians(angleb);.     answerupdate = math.tan(angleb);.     answer = sidea * answerupdate;.     system.out.println(answer);.  }  . }...i get a 0, instead of lets say a number that prints out right in my testing statement in solve equation constructor !..also here is how i called/initialized them in my main(don't think i called wrong!)...sideangle angleside = new sideangle(firstnum, secondnum);.angleside.solveequation();.righttriangle getanswer = new righttriangle();.system.out.println(getanswer.tostring()); &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;...prints out a 0 !"
