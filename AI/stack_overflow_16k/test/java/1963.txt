"file string making directory and not file-name when i create file in blank, it creates a folder with file-name + the file-type ""extension"" for example ..string path = ""c:""+file.separator+""hello""+file.separator+""hi.txt"";.file f = new file(path);.f.mkdirs(); .f.createnewfile();...this example creates a folder or directory named ""hi.txt"" and not a file as i expected. why is this not making a file?"
