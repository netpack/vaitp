"changing the default jre a browser uses to launch applets i have blank 6 and blank 7 installed and would like all browsers to use blank 6 to launch applets, and not blank 7. i went to control panel -> blank -> view, added the blankw.exe file which is in the jre6bin folder, and checked it as ""enabled"" and un-checked jre7. but still, when i launch an applet the dll's used are from the jre7 folder."
