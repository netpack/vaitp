"how to make different instances of a class? i am making a simple programm that allows people to checkin and out a hotel (for my cs class)...what i need to be able to do is check in a person in a room. there are four rooms. how can i make it so that when someone is checked in, the next person that checks in will check in room 2...i have the following already:..class hotel {..    room room1, room2, room3, room4;..    hotel() {.        room1 = new room();.        room2 = new room();.        room3 = new room();.        room4 = new room();.    }..    static checkin() {.        scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);.        system.out.print(""naam:"");.        string invoer2 = sc.nextline();..        if (room1.guest == null) {      .            room1.guestst = invoer2;.            system.out.println(""guest "" + room1.guest + "" gets room 1"");.            return;.        } else {.            system.out.println(""no rom"");.        }..        return;                      .    }.}..class room {.    static int count;.    string guest;..    room() {.        guest = null;.        count--;.    }..    room(string newguest) {.        guest = newguest;.        count++;.    }.}..class guest {.    string name;..    guest(string newname) {.        name = newname;.    }.}"
