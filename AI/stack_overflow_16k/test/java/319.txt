"classes inside interface i was trying to develop an interface and that interface will contain static class..class c1 {..    static interface i // a static interface or class can contain static members.static members can be.    //accessed without instantiating the particular class.    {..        static class c2 {.        }.    }..    public static void main(string a[]) {.        c1.i.c2 ob1 = new c1.i.c2();.        system.out.println(""object created"");.    }.}...but my query is that can interface contain classes which are not static and if yes , then how their object would be created , please advise. thanks"
