"blank parametrized more then one class. so, i have one stupid question, but i want to know the answer)..i have a parameterized method: ..public &lt;e,t extends enum&lt;t&gt; &amp; parametrizedcloneable&lt;e&gt;&gt; e gete(class&lt;t&gt; eclass){...}...and perhaps i want to have a list or annotation with classes which i can use in this method... list&lt;? extends enum &amp; parametrizedcloneable&gt; - incorrect. list&lt;? extends enum ,parametrizedcloneable&gt; - incorrect too...what the right way?"
