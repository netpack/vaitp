"why to use static in instance variable when we use ""this"" to call another construtor? i have little confusion about the below code...class testconstructor1{.static int num,num1;.testconstructor1(int n).{.    this(num,num1);.    num=n;.    system.out.println(""one argument constructor"");.    system.out.println(""value are ""+num+"" and ""+num1);.}.testconstructor1(int l,int m).{.    num=l;.    num1=m;.    system.out.println(""two argument constructor"");.    system.out.println(""value are ""+num+"" and ""+num1);.}.public static void main(string args[]).{.    testconstructor1 ts=new testconstructor1(10);..}.};  ...the constructor is called the way it have to called i.e. it is calling two argument constructor first and then its own constructor but i am interested to know why we have to use static before the instance variable and why we cannot use instance variable without declaring as static...i am waiting for your responses.thank you..."
