"how to test whether a sequence of integers was randomly generated? so i am trying to test if a sequence of integers was randomly generated, but it doesn't work... .this is what i've got so far:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    random r = new random();.    int[] sequence = { r.nextint(), r.nextint(), r.nextint() };.    system.out.println(israndomsequence(sequence));.}..public static boolean israndomsequence(int[] sequence) {.    for (long seed = 0; seed &lt; long.max_value; ++seed) {.        random r = new random(seed);.        long tries = 0;.        for (int i = 0; tries &lt; long.max_value; ++tries) {.            if (sequence[i] == r.nextint()) {.                if (++i == sequence.length) return true;.            } else {.                i = 0;.            }.        }.    }.    return false;.}...edit: to clarify; i want to know if, for instance the sequence { 4, 5, 6 } was generated by the random number generator. for starters limiting the testing to the blank.util.random (would be nice to have a general solution though if it's possible)."
