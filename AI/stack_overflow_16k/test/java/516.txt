"how do i add int. to char and string to get ""abc"" in the output? (for blank) so i was given this formatted problem and told to fix the format in order to get the output...int x = 0;.int y = 1;.char p = 'a';.string s = ""c""...the format is.(p + x + p + y + s)..and i'm supposed to change this (as long as i use x,y,p,s) to make the output be ""abc.""..how do i do this? the farthest i've gotten is that..system.out.println(p=(char)((int)p+x));...and that makes the output ""a""...what do i do? help please! i'm a very new programmer..thanks in advance."
