"detemine if a word is an email address the professor has asked us to do this:...  your program will receive an email address in args[0]. you must determine if it could be a real email address. this means:.  .  there must be an '@' character in it..  there must be at least one character before the '@' character..  after the '@' character, there must be a '.' character..  there must be at least one character between the '@' character and the '.' character..  there must be at least one character following the '.' character.  ...i have no idea where to even start. i set up the string value of args[0]but i don't know what to do. we learned about multiple if else statements and boolean stuff in class i think he wants us to use those. like for example how would i go about saying ""the email must contain @"" like how do i code for that?"
