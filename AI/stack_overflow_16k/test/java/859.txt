"""overridden method does not throw exception""? i am writing a program that demonstrates the use of inheritance and overriding methods. i want to create an if statement that involves the use of an exception. i ave included the exception in my if statement but when i write ""throws exception"" a the beginning of the method, i m getting n error message that says """"overridden method does not throw exception"". here is the code:..sub class..public class carnivore extends animal.{.   public food eat(food x) throws exception.    {.        if (x.equals(""plants"")) {.                throw new exception(""carnivores only eat meat!"");.            } else {.                return x;.            }..    }.    public void makenoise()  .    {.        noise = null;.    }.    public string getnoise()  .    {.        return noise;.    }   .}...super class..abstract public class animal {..string name;.int age;  .string noise;..abstract public void makenoise();..public string getname() {.        return name;.    }..    public void setname(string newname) {.        name = newname;.    }..abstract public food eat(food x);..}...any help on how to re-write this so that the exception is thrown properly is appreciated, thanks."
