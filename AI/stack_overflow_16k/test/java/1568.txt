"blank beginner: classes and methods i'm a noob and blank is my first programming language..i've this problem that i'm trying to solve:...  define a class to represent a sugar bowl sugar characterized by three.  things: total capacity (in grams), available quantity and quantity of.  the spoon (how many grams of sugar takes the spoon associated with.  it). set in this class:.  .  .  a constructor method to create a sugar bowl..  a method that allows to know the amount of sugar in the sugar bowl..  a method that allows to know how much it takes a spoonful of sugar..  a method which, given a number of scoops, removes the corresponding amount of sugar, returning this value..  a method to add sugar. if the supplied value exceeds the available space, the sugar bowl should be full, and the remaining amount.  returned. in other cases, should return zero..  .  .  set the class runsugarbowl as main and play around..  ...public class sugarbowl {..    private int totalcapacity;.    private int availablespace;.    private int spoonsize;.    private int occupiedspace = totalcapacity-availablespace;//is the same as amount of sugar in the bowl...    sugarbowl (int totalcapacity){.        availablespace=totalcapacity;.        spoonsize = totalcapacity/20;//arbitrary size.    }..    public int spoon(){.        return spoonsize;.    }..    public int occupied(){.        return occupiedspace;.    }..    public void scoops (int numberofscoops){.        int amounttaken = numberofscoops * spoonsize;.        if (amounttaken&lt;=occupiedspace){.            occupiedspace=occupiedspace-amounttaken;.            system.out.println(amounttaken);}.        else{.            system.out.println(""there's not that amount of sugar in the sugar bowl. try less."");}       .    }.    public int addsugar (int addedamount){.        if (addedamount&gt;availablespace){.            int remainingamount=addedamount-availablespace;.            availablespace=0;.            occupiedspace = totalcapacity-availablespace;.            return remainingamount;}.        else{.             availablespace = availablespace - addedamount;.             occupiedspace = totalcapacity-availablespace;.                return 0;}.    }.}...my problem now is that my one.occupied method returns 0 instead off the 200 in:....public class runsugarbowl {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        sugarbowl one = new sugarbowl(200);.        one.addsugar(300);.        system.out.println(""occupied size is : ""+ one.occupied());.    }.}"
