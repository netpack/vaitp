"need help finding the intersection of two equations in blank i saw someone else posted this problem but didn't word it properly so he didn't end up receiving any help, so i figured i would try and be more direct...here is the problem proposed to us :..// write and submit your code in a file called intersect.blank. use the io module to read inputs. use system.out.println() to print your answer...write a program that calculates the intersection between 2 equations:..a degree-2 (quadratic) polynomial i.e.  ..y = dx^2 + fx + g..where d, f, and g are constants..and a degree-1 (linear) equation i.e...y = mx + b..where m is the slope and b is a constant..the above is just text, not code that could appear in a blank program...ask the user for the constant values in each equation. output the intersection(s) as ordered pair(s) (x,y), or ""none"" if none exists. below is an example run...blank intersect..enter the constant d:.5.enter the constant f:.-3.enter the constant g:.2.enter the constant m:.1.enter the constant b:.3..the intersection(s) is/are:.(1,4).(-0.20,2.8).//..the main problem is essentially asking us to write a code that asks the user to imput the individual constants and the slope of the two equations, one being a quadratic polynomial and the other being a linear equation in point-slope...i understand that we have to use the quadratic equation in the code, however i have no idea how to actually code this in...once we have had the user imput the constants, in this case 5 (d,f,g,m,b; with m being slope)  we need to have the code run the calculations to imput those constants into the above example ( y = dx^2 + fx + g  |  y = mx + b)  and return either ""none"" if there is no intersection, or if it does intersect, the ordered pair at which it does intersect (x,y).  ..i know already that if 0 is entered as the constants it returns (nan,nan) which i also know needs to be re-written to none...so far i only have the following:..public class intersect {.    public static void main(string[] args) {..    system.out.println(""enter the constant d:"");.    int d = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant f:"");.    int f = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant g:"");.    int g = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant m:"");.    int m = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant b:"");.    int b = io.readint();...if anyone can shed some light on this that would be fantastic, thanks!..edit1 :..so far i've changed the code to the following, however, i still don't know how to get it to return to me an answer:..public class intersect {.    public static void main(string[] args) {..    system.out.println(""enter the constant d:"");.    int d = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant f:"");.    int f = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant g:"");.    int g = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant m:"");.    int m = io.readint();..    system.out.println(""enter the constant b:"");.    int b = io.readint();...    //y = dx^2 + fx + g.    //y = mx + b..    //mx + b = dx^2 + fx + g..    //x^2 * (d)  +   x * ( f - m )  +  ( g - b )..    int a = d;.    int b =  f - m;.    int c =  g - b;...    double x1 = - b + math.sqrt(  b^2  -  4 * a * c ) / (2 * a);.    double x2 = - b - math.sqrt(  b^2  -  4 * a * c ) / (2 * a);...    double y1 = m * x1 + b;.    double y2 = m * x1 + b; ...}..also, eclipse is telling me that x2,y1, and y2 aren't used at all..i know i need to use system.out.println()  however i don't understand what i can put there to make the answer an ordered pair.  also, i tried setting an if statement to have the answer return none instead of nan however it instead returns, nan none."
