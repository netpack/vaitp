"what does ""the type arraylist is not generic"" mean? i am new to blank and trying to learn the various collections that programmers can use. i imported ""blank.util"" into a scrapbook in eclipse and inspected the following code...arraylist&lt;string&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();.list.add(""test1"");.list.add(""test2"");...i receive this output...the type arraylist is not generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments &lt;string&gt;.syntax error, parameterized types are only available if source level is 5.0.the type arraylist is not generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments &lt;string&gt;.syntax error, parameterized types are only available if source level is 5.0...what does this error mean? i did not make a generic array list; i made an array list of strings. furthermore, what is ""source level""?"
