"blank arrayblockingqueue for implementing muliple producers and multiple consumer say in my system i have multiple producer threads and multiple consumer threads and i am planning to use the arrayblockingqueue as the shared resources. now what i see from the implementation of arrayblockingqueue is when it does insert() it does call notempty.signal instead of notempty.signalall. therefore, what i wonder about is will it wake up all consumer threads who are waiting for the elements, or will it only wake up one consumer thread? if it wakes up only one consumer thread, what i can use to implement multiple consumer thread in my app?"
