"how would one find the product of given numbers with a while loop? i am asked to do the follow question - ..write a blank program that uses a while statement to prompt the user to enter 6 integer numbers..your program should print the product of the numbers entered when the loop ends...   example output.   product of four numbers.   enter a number: 2.   enter a number: 2.   enter a number: 2.   enter a number: 2.   product equals 16...i've attempted the question with the following code: `..    //declaring variables.    int num1, num2, num3, num4, num5, num6, result;..    //prompting user.    scanner scanner = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.print(""enter a number: "");.    num1 = scanner.nextint();..    system.out.print(""enter a number: "");.    num2 = scanner.nextint();..    system.out.print(""enter a number: "");.    num3 = scanner.nextint();..    system.out.print(""enter a number: "");.    num4 = scanner.nextint();..    system.out.print(""enter a number: "");.    num5 = scanner.nextint();..    system.out.print(""enter a number: "");.    num6 = scanner.nextint();..    //calculations.    result = num1*num2*num3*num4*num5*num6;..    //output.    system.out.println(""the product of your numbers entered are: "" + result);..}...}`..however i must use a while loop, how would i incorporate that?"
