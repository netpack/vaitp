"issue with program executing infinately, blank the little method im working on is supposed to simulate a position starting at 0, then randomly steping back or going forward until either position 3 or position negative 3 is reached, while recording the highest position reached incase negative 3 is reached. ..the method i have written here isnt working because its not properly stopping at -3 or 3. ..public void randomwalk(){..    random ran = new random();.    int position = 0; .    int max = 0; .    int steps = 0; .    while(position != 3 || position != -3){.        int r = ran.nextint(2);..        if(position &gt; max){.            max = position;.        } else if(r == 0){.           position += 1;.        }else{.            position -= 1 ; .        }.        system.out.println(""position = "" + position);.    }.    system.out.println(""max position = "" + max);..}...i hope this is an acceptable question format. ..any help will be appreciated, thanks"
