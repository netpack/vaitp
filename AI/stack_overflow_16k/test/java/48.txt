"value of an array is changing without assignment i am using just this code to flip a row in a 2 dimensional matrix in blank. it seems like such a simple code but for some reason, it is not working. the rown of a matrix was originally ..112 42 83 119...became..119 83 83 119...i debugged the code and found out that the tempmatrix2 is also being changed. i can't understand why. it changes in the for loop in the same line in which i am assigning value to matrix[rown][i]..any help is appreciated...static int[][] fliprow(int[][] matrix, int rown, int n) {.    int[] tempmatrix2 = matrix[rown];..    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {.        matrix[rown][i] = tempmatrix2[n-i-1];.    }..    return matrix;.}"
