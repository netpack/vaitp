"blank printing a triangle using recursion assume  the availability of a method  named  makeline that can be passed a non-negative integer  n and a character  c and return a string  consisting of n identical characters  that are all equal  to c. ..write a method  named  printtriangle that receives two integer  parameters  n and k. if n is negative the method  does nothing. if n happens to be an even number, its value  is raised to the next odd number (e.g. 4-->5). then, when k has the value  zero, the method  prints a symmetric triangle of o's (the capital letter o) as follows: first a line of n o, followed by a line of n-2 o's (indented by one space), and then a line of n-4 o's (indented by two spaces), and so on. for example, if the method  received 5,0 (or 4,0) it would print:..ooooo. ooo.  o ...note: in the above output, the first line contains 0 spaces before the first o, the next line 1 space, and so on. ..note: these instructions state what the method  does when k is zero, but it is up to you, the programmer, to determine what it does when k is not zero and use it for your advantage. ..the method  must not use a loop of any kind (for, while, do-while) to accomplish its job. the method  should invoke makeline to accomplish the task of creating strings  of varying lengths. ..here is my code:..public void printtriangle(int n, int k) {.if (n &lt;= 0).    return;..if(n%2 == 0).   n++;..  system.out.println(makeline(k, ' ')+ makeline(n, 'o') +makeline(k, ' '));.  printtriangle(n-2,k++);..}...i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong, can someone help?"
