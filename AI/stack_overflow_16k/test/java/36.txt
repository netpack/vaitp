"blank: waiting for a mouseclickedevent i am writing a program where users answer questions by clicking on jtable cells. if the question is answered correctly/incorrectly, the mouselistener    changes the value of answeredresult. the program will keep running until there are no available questions (the available array list contains a list of items, which is a class i created that contains strings event, year, and description, called by getevent(), getyear(), and getdescription() methods respectively). however, for each question, i want to wait until a mouseclickedevent is detected before executing the proceeding code (see below).     ..i know that adding another while loop for waiting is really bad. i've also seen .some answers suggesting to put whatever i want to do in the mouseclicked method, but i don't know how in my case, since i want to repeat it multiple times.  ..i think another problem is that the program is stuck in the while(available.size()!=0) loop. so it cant detect the mouse click.  ..any suggestions on how to make this work?..arraylist&lt;item&gt; available = new arraylist&lt;item&gt;();.for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++){.    available.add(new item(""event "" + i, ""year "" + i, ""description "" + i));.}..jtable table = new jtable(model);.table.addmouselistener(new blank.awt.event.mouseadapter() {.    @override.    public void mouseclicked(blank.awt.event.mouseevent evt) {.        int row = table.rowatpoint(evt.getpoint());.        int col = table.columnatpoint(evt.getpoint());    .        if (row &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; col == 2 &amp;&amp; canplay) {.            clickedyear = (string)data[row][col];.            if(clickedyear.equals(answeryear)){ .                answeredresult = 1;                        .            }else{.                answeredresult = -1;.            }.        }.     }.});..while(available.size()!=0){.    promptpanel.removeall();.    answeredresult = 0; //0-unanswered 1-correct 2-incorrect..    int random = (int)(math.random()*(available.size()-1));.    jlabel label = new jlabel(available.get(random).getevent()+""n"");.    promptpanel.add(label);    .    canplay = true;    ..    //wait for mouse clicked before proceeding to the next code..    if(answeredresult == 1){.        jlabel correct = new jlabel(""correct!"");.        promptpanel.add(correct);.    }else if(answeredresult == -1){.        jlabel wrong = new jlabel(""wrong."");.        promptpanel.add(wrong);.    }..    revalidate();.    repaint();           .    available.remove(random);.}"
