"how to map two lists of objects by id efficiently i have a list of objects (list 1) that i'm looping through. each object has an id string associated with it. i have another list (list 2) containing a different type of object. i want to map the objects in list 2 to my list 1 objects. list 1 has a getid() function and list 2 has a getlist1id() function, that gives the id of the object its supposed to map to in list 1. how do i do this in the most efficient way possible?"
