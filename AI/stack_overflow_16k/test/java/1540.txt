"getting relativepath and then diving deeper i have a package structure like ..a.|_b.|_c.  |_d.    |_""myfile.txt"".mymain.blank...in my main i want to do something like..path currentrelativepath = paths.get("""");...which gives me the current relative path to where my main() is located. something along the lines of /home/myprojects/project1/src/ how do i amend the above to get me the relative path all the way down to the level of myfile.txt?..i have tried things like:.. path currentrelativepath = paths.get("""" + ""/b/c/d/"");...and.. path currentrelativepath = paths.get("""",""b/c/d/"");...and.. path currentrelativepath = paths.get("""");. path finalpath = paths.get(currentrelativepath.tostring(),""/b/c/d/"");...but in each case it only gets the ""/b/c/d/"" portion and not the beginning of the path."
