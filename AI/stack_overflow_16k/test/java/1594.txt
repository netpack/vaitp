"saving data for a basic leaderboard? i know how to save data pretty easily with the printwriter to a txt file etc...i have a minesweeper game that saves the name, boardsize, time taken for completion and how many mines were used; the file looks like this:..name..10x10..00:00:01..20..gap..repeat..but trying to get this to be sorted is going to be a very difficult ordeal as none of this data when saved in a file is technically ""related...are there any ways of saving this data so they are some what related...i was thinking of saving it in one big long string with break character at the end and between such as.. name + ""!!"" + boardsize + ""!!"" + time + ""!!"" + mines + ""!?"" &lt; as the end break...any help would be great, thanks."
