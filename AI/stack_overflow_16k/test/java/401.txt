"sufficient method for testing equality i want to implement a custom equals() method for a class i have, board. the method compares the arrays of each board, defined as private int[] board, returning true if the arrays are equal and false if they are not. i know there are some ""gotchas"" in testing equality, so i was wondering if the following code was optimal and sufficient for truly testing the equality: ..public boolean equals(object y) {.    if (this.getclass() != y.getclass()) return false; //must be same class -- duh.    board that = (board) y; //y cast as board.    int[] thisboardcopy = this.getboard(); //copy of current board.    int[] thatboardcopy = that.getboard(); //copy of y's board.    return arrays.equals(thisboardcopy, thatboardcopy);.}"
