"find serialversionuid (bash: serialver: command not found) i am trying to find out the serialversionuid for a class which is on a tomee server using serialver command but when i try to run it, it says:..bash: serialver: command not found..i noticed that i have jre 1.7.0_51-b13 installed but don't have jdk installed. so, i might not be able to use serialver. is there any other way i could find the serialversionid just having the class file? ..everything is setup on a suse 11.0 server...can anyone please help?"
