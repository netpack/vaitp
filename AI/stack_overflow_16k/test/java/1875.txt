"blank performance - good practices (using references) this is the basic structure of code on a project i am contributing to:..protected modelandview showform(actioncontext ctx) throws exception {.    command cmd = ctx.getcommand();.    subcommand subcmd = cmd.getsubcommand();.    dosmth(cmd, subcmd);.    dosmthelse(ctx);.    dosmthelse2(ctx);.}...and every dosmthelse(ctx) begins with ..command cmd = ctx.getcommand();.subcommand subcmd = cmd.getsubcommand();...for me it is not clear why it looks like this and it should be changed towards the way it looks in dosmth. please correct me if i'm wrong, but i think it also works slower as it is now."
