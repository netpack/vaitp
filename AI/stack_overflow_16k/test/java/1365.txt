blank audio file read and creating echo effect i have just started learning blank and i have to deliver a assignment in which i have to read an audio (.wav) file and create echo effect of the audio file and save it without using any external library. kindly guide me from where exactly to start. although i have a basic knowledge about c++ upto functions and a little about classes &amp; objects. looking forward for the right direction as i am short of time! .thanks.
