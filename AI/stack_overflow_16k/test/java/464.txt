"resolving method name from inner class public class x {..    public void close() {.      // ....    }..    public class xinputstream extends inputstream {..        public void f() {.           close(); // are we calling close() on inputstream or x??.        }.    }.}....the compiler is fine with this sort of thing, so obviously it knows which method to call. what exactly is the rule in the language spec for resolving this?.other than renaming my close() method, are there any steps i could take to make this code more readable?"
