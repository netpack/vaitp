"which jre does c:programdataoracleblankblankpathblank.exe use? i'm trying to figure out which environment variable blank uses to find/detect the jre used by c:programdataoracleblankblankpathblank.exe...as per oracle's design, the only files i have in the c:programdataoracleblankblankpath are ...blank.exe.blankw.exe.blankws.exe...if i set my blank_home to empty or to some random folder, running an application with blank.exe still works.  so i can only assume that it isn't using the blank_home value.  so how does it find the jre folder?  does it default to something specific?  i have no jre_home var set either."
