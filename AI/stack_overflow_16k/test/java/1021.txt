"how to get jspinner to multiply radio button value so i have this pizza program and for one of the pages, it asks for the sides the user will want...in this program, i have 3 sections, 1 for drinks which will be priced at 1.50, snacks which will be priced at 1.00 and appetizers which will be priced at 5.00...what i want to do is on my blank gui is when i click one of the radio buttons i want the price of the item to be displayed on a label i made, then the user has a choice to select the quantity of that item and so when he does it multiples that price and puts that price on the label...for example, let's say i have a coke radio button. the user selects that and on my label, it displays the price 1.50. then the user let's say selects the quantity of 4 the price should display $6.00 on the label. ..then the user clicks on one of the appetizers let's say chicken wings which are 5.00 and wants 2 of them now the price should display $16...i really have no clue on how to do this, since whenever i try adding radio button value it always messes me up. if someone can please try and help i'll be very grateful...i don't have a code to you now since i'm having trouble on how to this."
