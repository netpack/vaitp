"execute a method in blank with restricted permissions is there any way i can use accesscontroller.doprivileged with a new accesscontrolcontext to restrict access to classes/methods?  i'd like to have a subroutine that can call untrusted code without access to touch the file system or open sockets.  ..the specific use case is, allowing end users to provide fragments of code or scripts (for example, blankscript or groovy) that can execute with limited permissions...what i'm looking for is something like a normal security policy file, scoped to the user-provided code rather than the whole jvm."
