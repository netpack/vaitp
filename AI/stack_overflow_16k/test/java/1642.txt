what is the use of getter and setter suppose we want to set a value of int y to 5 we generally do y=5;..int y=0;.y=5;...but if we use getter and setter than we do in following way..public class x {.private int y;.    public int gety() {.    return y;.}.public void sety(int y) {.    this.y = y;.}...and after that we create object of x and call its method..x x1=new x();.x1.sety(5);...my question is if we can directly set y=5 then why the use getter and setter methods
