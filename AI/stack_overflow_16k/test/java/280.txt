"which is the best way to represent the business opening hours in a blank object? i need to represent opening hours, and a method which returns true/false for a certain day and time..is there any package which has this functionality already?..edit: basically i would need to construct an object with data out of db or a file, then perform a basic check against the object, like if it's closed at a certain moment...the problem was that some businesses will have working hours after 00:00 so it overlaps the next day..in this case i figure out that the object should be able to support multiple time frames per day, also to cover lunch brakes."
