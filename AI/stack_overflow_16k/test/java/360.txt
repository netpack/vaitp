"blank code issue: dividing two variables i'm trying to create a short program for my blank class that requires me to calculate the batting average of a player. for some reason when i go to divide the two variables i get 0.0 even though the user enters in data. i added print statements to try and debug my code but the numbers are appearing after the user enters them but they aren't dividing when i pass them to battingavg. can anyone else spot my error?..import blank.util.scanner;..public class problem42 {..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        //keyboard input for hits &amp; number of at-bats.        scanner numberofhits = new scanner( system.in);.        system.out.print(""how many hits does the batter have?"");.        int hits = numberofhits.nextint();..        system.out.println(hits);..        scanner numberofbats = new scanner( system.in);.        system.out.print(""what is the batters number of at-bats?"");.        int atbats = numberofbats.nextint();..        // calculating the batting average.        double battingavg = (hits) / (atbats);..        system.out.println(battingavg);.        //eligibility for the all stars game.        if (battingavg &gt; .300) {.            system.out.println(""player is eligible for all stars game."");.        } else { .            system.out.println(""player is ineligible for all stars game."");.        }..        numberofhits.close();.        numberofbats.close();.    }..}"
