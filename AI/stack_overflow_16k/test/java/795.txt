dynamically load and run blank code from within blank application i am thinking about writing a blank application where the user can write some modules in blank and add them to a library in this application. the modules will be some calculations that use data from the main app. maybe a bit like vba in office..i would appreciate if someone would give me some hints where to start as i couldn't find something useful on the net..thanks in advance!
