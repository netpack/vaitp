"generate setters only in the class constructor or generate outside builder in classes in blank, it is common (at least in college only see so) create private attributes and generate getters and setters for these attributes...but, i read that you can do something a little different: only generate the getters and leave setters in the constructor..in my head, leaving the setters in the constructor, i think the code will be easier to understand and easier to give maintenance ....do according to this second option, leave the setters in the constructor, it is good practice (or even is the best practice) to be applied in the construction of classes? or create gets and sets for all attributes is most recommended?"
