"how to find a specific word in html using blank? i am having a bit of some trouble with this. i tried using regex but regex does not give me the exact number of matches i need. i know how many matches i am suppose to have...i am trying to find all occurrences of a specific word on a .txt file that is just an html page in text. ..the problem is, the word i am searching for can be an id, class, or just in text on the website so i need to scrape the entire website for the word...also, with regex, if the word was 'car' regex was matching it with 'racecar', for example...i looked into https://jsoup.org/ and is that the best way to go...just so i am clear, i watch my method to find, in this example, 'dog', twice in this piece of html..&lt;p id=""dog""&gt;the dog went for a walk today.&lt;/p&gt;...i hope i am clear - this might even be able to be done with regex but i could have doing it incorrectly. i was using pattern and using my pattern as \bwordtobesearchedfor\b"
