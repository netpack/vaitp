"how to save a value of a string variable and use it later when i wish even every time i run the code? i have a requirement that i have some string values and i have to save the values somewhere say in a list.and the values once i inserted into the list should remain there.so that if i want to use that values later i should not put  those values in the list again.i am giving a simple piece of code to illustrate my problem.....public class chkrecords {..public static void main(string a[]){..    list&lt;string&gt; inti=new arraylist&lt;&gt;();....    string arr[]={""a"",""b"",""c"",""d""};..//      for(int i=0;i&lt;arr.length;i++){.//          .//          inti.add(string.valueof(arr[i]));.//      }.     system.out.println(inti);..}.}...this is the piece of code i am trying to implement ... the for loop is going to insert the values for the first time.and from then i don't want to use that loop again,but i want the values be in the list..can anyone help me...."
