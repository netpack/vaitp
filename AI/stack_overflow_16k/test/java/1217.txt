"how can i use field inside method? to begin with, this is my first question in here. ..i want to use double mebleg inside transfer method, and i has equaled mebleg to balance in constructor, but unfortunately, the amount of parameter of balance doesn't go with mebleg into transfer method. how can i solve this problem?..i am new at programming. that's why if my question was answered, could you suggest that links of answers?..class acount {..    static double mebleg;..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        acount a = new acount(100);.        acount b = new acount(0.0);.        acount c = new acount(0.0);.        acount.transfer(a, b, 50);.        acount.transfer(b, c, 25);..    }..    public acount(double balance) {.        mebleg = balance;.    }..    public static void transfer(acount from, acount to, double howmuch) {.        system.out.println(acount.mebleg - howmuch);..    }..}"
