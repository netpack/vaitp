"blank reserved words as identifiers this is my first post here. i'm taking my first class in blank and i have come across a question which i believe is a trick question. i know that reserved words can't be used as identifiers and identifiers are only supposed to use upper/lowercase letters, 0-9, $, and _. long is a reserved word, but would using long be ok since blank is case sensitive? i have looked all over google for the answer for this. i could not find an answer on stack overflow so sorry if this is answered elsewhere on the forum!..thanks!"
