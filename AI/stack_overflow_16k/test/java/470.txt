"bit operations converting to an integer i have some binary operations that are not working like i expect..i have byte array with the first 2 bytes having these values : 0x5, and 0xe0..i want to combine them into an integer value that should be 0x5e0..i tried doing : ..int val = (b[i]) &lt;&lt; 8 | b[i+1];...but the value is coming out 0xffffffee0 and the first byte 0x5 is getting lost..i thought this would be easy? what am i doing wrong?"
