"blank exception hierarchy problem i have a curious issue here..in my  ejbcreate() method from where i  insert the front-end populated field vales into the database , there is null checking done, so the nullable fields are converted to """"(empty space) fields and the row is inserted properly into the database...now my ejbstore() method doesnt have the same null checking so it always used to throw a ""blank.sql.sqlexception"" but the following .catch (blank.sql.sqlexception e) used to catch it and the application was running fine...now there is a new patch added to the unix box(my os), now the same exception is not been caught in the ""catch (blank.sql.sqlexception e) block"", instead its falling under generic ""exception block"", so my code is throwing a ""corba related nullpointerexception"" and the application crashes...can anybody let know how does a  os patch can change the blank exception type hierarchy.??"
