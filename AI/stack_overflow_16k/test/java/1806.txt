"check that scanner input is only an integer i am attempting to create a simple program to validate that a user's input is a positive integer. however i am running into an issue when i use the scanner.hasnextint() method. if input contains an integer such as ""five 6"" my program will read the 6 in as an integer. however, i want such a statement to be invalid and prompt the user to need to enter only an integer value. and therefore the program would output ""please enter an integer value: ""...this is what my program looks like:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class inputvalidation {.    public static void main(string args[]) {.        scanner in = new scanner(system.in);..        // input validation for integers and positive numbers.        int input = 0;.        boolean validationsuccessful = false;..        system.out.print(""please enter the input: "");.        do {..            // validate that the input is an integer.            if (in.hasnextint() == true) {.                input = in.nextint();.            } else {.                system.out.print(""please enter an integer value: "");.                in.next();.                continue;.            }..            // validate that the input is positive.            if (input &lt; 0) {.                system.out.print(""please print a positive integer: "");.                continue;.            } else {.                validationsuccessful = true;.            }.            system.out.println(""the input is: "" + input);.        } while (validationsuccessful == false);..    }.}...edit:.i understand the difference between next() vs. nextline(). however, my issue is the validation aspect of the line actually only being an integer vs. the line containing an integer."
