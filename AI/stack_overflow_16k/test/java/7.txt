"thread restart after computer standby i have an application running in the windows system tray and it seem like after i put the computer in stand-by (not shutdown!) when i turn the system back on, a thread i have running in the application does not continue running. how would i either a) keep the thread running, or b) determine the system has come back from stand-by and restart the thread?"
