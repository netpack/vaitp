"console calculator error blank so everything is working fine for this calculator besides for the askcalcchoice1. since askcalcchoice1 is a string, i am calling it wrong (obviously). the error says it cannot convert string to int, as well as convert int to boolean. however, when i make the inputoperation as a string, it breaks the other 2 calls below askcalcchoice1. (it breaks displayredults and asktwovalues because those are not strings). i do not know how to format askcalcchoice in order to call for this method that is written in another class wihtout breaking anything. askcalcchoice is written as a string which i pasted below the oopcalculator code. is there any way and can someone please show me how to write that portion of that code in oopcalculator?..    int inputoperation; // user to choose the function.    askcalcchoice1 myaskcalcchoice1 = new askcalcchoice1(); ..    //menu becomes a complete string below.    string menu = ""welcome to hilda wu's calculatortt"".            + ""n1. additionn"".            + ""2. subtractionn"".            + ""3. multiplicationn"".            + ""4. divisionn"".            + ""5. exitnn"";.    calculatorcommands.picknewsymbol(menu); //complete menu will be picked up as a string and display.    calculatorcommands.putdownsymbol();..    while (inputoperation = myaskcalcchoice1.calcchoice()) { //this will call for myaskcalcchoice1 class.        calculatorcommands.picknewsymbol(""n""); //pick up the class .        calculatorcommands.putdownsymbol(); //display the class..        asktwovalues myasktwovalues = new asktwovalues();           .        float[] myfloats = myasktwovalues.inputfloats(inputoperation);...        displayresults mydisplayresults = new displayresults();.        float result = mydisplayresults.showresults(inputoperation, myfloats);..        string strformat = ""the answer is:  "" + result + ""nn""; //print out the answer is as a string.        calculatorcommands.picknewsymbol(strformat); //pick up string from above.        calculatorcommands.putdownsymbol(); //display string.        calculatorcommands.picknewsymbol(menu); // pick up menu from the beginning of code, loop to calculator menu.        calculatorcommands.putdownsymbol(); //display menu as loop.    }.    calculatorcommands.picknewsymbol(""nthank you for using hilda wu's calculatorn""); //when user choose to exit calculator.    calculatorcommands.putdownsymbol();.}.......string calcchoice() {.    string input;.    do { //do loop will continue to run until user enters correct response.        system.out.print(""please enter a number between 1 and 5, a for addition, s for subtraction, m for multiplication, or d for division, or x for exit: "");.        try { .            input = readinput.nextline(); //user will enter a response.            if (input.equals(""a"") || input.equals(""s"") || input.equals(""m"") || input.equals(""d"") || input.equals(""x"")) {.                system.out.println(""thank you"");.                break; //user entered a character of a, s, m, or d.            } else if (integer.parseint(input) &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; integer.parseint(input) &lt;= 5) { .                system.out.println(""thank you"");.                break; //user entered a number between 1 and 5.            } else {.                system.out.println(""sorry, you have entered an invalid choice, please try again."");.            }.            continue;.        }.        catch (final numberformatexception e) {.            system.out.println(""you have entered an invalid choice. try again."");.            continue; // loop will continue until correct answer is found.        }.    } while (true);.    return input;.}...}"
