"is there a way to access a subclass element from a super class? i need a method in a class that is going to be used in subclasses, although this method uses a property that is changed in subclasses. is there a way to access the property of the subclass without having to override the method?..i've tried using a getter for the property, but got the same result...public class superclass {.    private static final string a = ""super"";..    public void supermethod(){.        system.out.println(""supermethod: "" + a);.    }..}..public class childclass extends superclass {..    private static final string a = ""child"";..}..public class main {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        superclass s = new superclass();.        childclass c = new childclass();.        s.supermethod();.        c.supermethod();.    }.}...the console shows:..supermethod: super..supermethod: super..the expected result is:..supermethod: super..supermethod: child"
