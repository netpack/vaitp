"classnotfoundexception at asm.objectwriter.getcommonsuperclass i'm trying to instrument the apache commons math with the asm library and for some classes a classnotfoundexception is thrown when i try to write it to a file using a classwriter...one class that throws the error is org/apache/commons/math3/linear/realvector.class..the stacktrace is:..blank.lang.runtimeexception: blank.lang.classnotfoundexception: org.apache.commons.math3.linear.array2drowrealmatrix.at org.objectweb.asm.classwriter.getcommonsuperclass(unknown source).at org.objectweb.asm.classwriter.a(unknown source).at org.objectweb.asm.frame.a(unknown source).at org.objectweb.asm.frame.a(unknown source).at org.objectweb.asm.methodwriter.visitmaxs(unknown source).at org.objectweb.asm.tree.methodnode.accept(unknown source).at org.objectweb.asm.tree.methodnode.accept(unknown source).at org.objectweb.asm.tree.classnode.accept(unknown source)...i googled for the exception and all i could find was related to some cobertura problems, or other unrelated libraries that weren't helpful...this even happens if i don't perform any instrumentation at all. i also tried to explicitly adding the missing class to the classpath, but this didn't work either...any ideas?"
