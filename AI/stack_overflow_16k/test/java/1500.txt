"blank code to generate random string based on regex blank code to generate random string based on regex. i tried generex library , but it's not giving exact output. for example:..       generex generex = new generex(""^[6-9]\d{9}$"");.       system.out.println(generex.random());...output is : ^8677547981$ .while i was expecting output to be 8677547981.it seems generex is not able to handle special characters like ""^"" , ""$"" etc...can someone pls help?"
