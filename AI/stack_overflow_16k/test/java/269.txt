"what is a better way to save the items of the playlist? in my music player if you add songs to the playlist , program first creates a directory by the name of playlist and then a .txt file. in this file , it adds the path or name of the song added in the playlist.each entry is on a new line.so if i create a playlist named ""ghazals"" and add 100 songs into that playlist 100 new lines are inserted in the txt file under the folder named ""ghazals""...if there are 50 playlists there will be 50 folders and in each folder there will be txt files that has the list of songs. ..for sure,this is not the right way . what should i do to avoid this (the cluster) ? for example how do players like ""window media player"" save their playlists ?"
