"blank - file -->bytearray-->blob and vice-versa i am trying to convert file to byte array and then to blob to store in database...and then while retrieving from database i am converting blob to byte array and then byte array to file.i am using blank1.6..below is the code i am trying to use :-..// for converting file to bytearray and then to blob.byte[] img = new byte [(int) file.length()];..blob.setbytes(1l,img);..// for converting back to byte array.blob blob = rs.getblob(file_contents);.byte[] blobasbytes = blob.getbytes(1,(int)blob.length());...i debugged and found out that, the byte array is not the same in both the cases, because of which i am not able to open the image. can anybody please suggest what i am doing wrong here...thanks .sj"
