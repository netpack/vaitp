"variable might not have been initialized, don't understand why so i'm in an intro blank course, making a grade calculator with the added task of adjusting grades on this set of conditions:..if the student has done the bonus work:...the exam 1 grade is either:..80% of exam 2’s grade if it is higher than the original exam 1 grade, or.the original exam 1 grade...the exam 2 grade is either:..80% of exam 3’s grade if it is higher than the original exam 2 grade, or.the original exam 2 grade.....the modification is always made for exam 1 first...i've tried this first with the exam 1 grade, attempting to assign g1n the value g2 * 0.8 if (g2 * 0.8) &gt; g1, and giving it the value of g1 otherwise. i'm having trouble seeing how g1n isn't being initialized since it seems to me like the conditions i've just listed are exhaustive...below is the relevant part of my code. what gives?..// declare variables.int g1;.int g2;.int g3;.char grade;.double g1n;.double g2n;.double avg;.string bonus;..// get input.system.out.println(""***************  grade computer *************"");.system.out.println(""enter the student's first name: "");.string first = input.next();.system.out.println(""enter the student's middle initial: "");.string mid = input.next();.system.out.println(""enter the student's last name: "");.string last = input.next();.system.out.println(""enter exam 1 grade: "");.g1 = input.nextint();.system.out.println(""enter exam 2 grade: "");.g2 = input.nextint();.system.out.println(""enter exam 3 grade: "");.g3 = input.nextint();.system.out.println(""was bonus work done? [yes/no]: "");.bonus = input.next();.system.out.println(g1 + "" "" + g2 + "" "" + g3 + "" "" + bonus);..// adjust exam scores if necesssary.if (bonus.equals(""yes"")) {.    if (((double)g2 * 0.8) &gt; g1) {.        g1n = ((double)g2 * 0.8);.    } else {.        g1n = (double)g1;.    }.}...edit:..i changed it to this and am still getting the same message.....if (bonus.equals(""yes"")) {.    if (((double)g2 * 0.8) &gt; g1) {.        g1n = ((double)g2 * 0.8);.    }.    if (((double)g3 * 0.8) &gt; g2) {.        g2n = ((double)g3 * 0.8);.    }.} else {.    g1n = (double)g1;.    g2n = (double)g2;.}..// compute average.avg = (g1n + (double)g2 + (double)g3) / 3;"
