"scanner cannot be converted to int for some reason i get an error that scanner cannot be converted to int, even though i'm using  nextint . why is that? complete noob here...system.out.println(""how many numbers does your array contains?"") ;.scanner num= new scanner(system.in);.scanner mis=new scanner(system.in);.system.out.println(num.nextint());.int maara[]=new int[num]; .for(int counter=0; counter&lt;maara.length; counter++){.    system.out.println(""enter num"");.    system.out.println(mis.nextint());.    maara[counter]=mis ;...i've searched a lot but the problem was always people using nextline, here i'm stating that the input will be an integer and it's still won't run..this is just part of the code, but i encounter this error alot. i've imported the scanner. .thank you very much in advance!..p.s. - i'm using netbeans on ubuntu 17.10. have no idea if that matters."
