"can i call new multiple times on static reference to a class? class a {}..class b {.    static a somereference = null;..    void foo () {.        // does calling this function many times create new objects, or all objects will point to one memory..        somereference = new a; .    }.}...isn't making a reference static mean that it will not be able to point to new memory location.?.thank you."
