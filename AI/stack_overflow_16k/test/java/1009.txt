"calling out the constructor and assigning values to it from a scanner method i was trying to make a program that asks the user to create a person or a group of persons and assign names and age to them. so i made a constructor ""try"" and a method ""askuser"".in askuser() i use a do/while loop where user is asked to input a name, an age and if he likes to create another person. now how do i take the input data each time the loop runs, and send it to constructor to create new objects with it? and how these new objects will be called? ..import blank.util.scanner;.public class try{.    static string name;.    static int age;.    static scanner a = new scanner(system.in);.    static scanner b = new scanner(system.in);.    static scanner c = new scanner(system.in);.    public try(string name, int age){.        this.name=name;.        this.age= age;.        system.out.println(""this is ""+name+"", and he is ""+age+"" old."");.    }.    public static void askuser(){.        int x=0;.        do {system.out.print(""what's the name of the person ?"");.            name= a.nextline();.            system.out.print(""how old is he? "");.            age= b.nextint();.            system.out.print(""would u like to creat another person "");.            string yes = c.nextline();.            if(!(yes.equals(""yes""))){x++;}.        } while(x==0);.    }.    public static void main (string[] args){.        askuser();.        system.out.print(age+ "" ""+ name);   .    }.}"
