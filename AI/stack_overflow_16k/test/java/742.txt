"where can i implement polymorphism? sorry to ask this silly question, i'm new to blank..i have a super class called sales manager, and its subclass are itementry, supplierentry, purchaserequisition and so on. can anyone suggest me where to implement the overloading and overriding concept? i mean ya although they are inherited, but sales manager and itementry are completely different things isn't?..unlike the superclass car, subclass ford, volkswagen, this only make sense...appreciate for you help."
