"how to get each letter and add them as points with a substring method i've been trying to create an algorithm where each letter adds points. i don't want to use charat, i'd like to use the substring method...my problem is that string letter does not seem to get each letter and the result is always 0...is there a way to get each letter and convert it to points?..public class wdlpoints{.    public static void main(string[] args){.        string word = ""ldwwl"";.        system.out.println(getmatchpoints(word));.    }.    public static int getmatchpoints(string word) {.        int points = 0;.        string letter = word.substring(5);.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; word.length(); i++) {.        if (letter.equals(""w"")) {.            points+=3;.        }.        else if (letter.equals(""d"")) {.            points+=1;.        }.        else {.            points = 0;.        }.        }.        return points;.    }.}"
