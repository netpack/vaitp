"initializing a hashmap with default values? i'm implementing the a* search algorithm given here, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a*_search_algorithm..this line indicates we need to initiliaze a map with the default values of infinity, ..gscore := map with default value of infinity...so i tried that here, ..map&lt;state, double&gt; gscore = new hashmap&lt;state, double&gt;(double.positive_infinity);...this does not work however the following does;..map&lt;state, double&gt; gscore = new hashmap&lt;state, double&gt;((int) double.positive_infinity);...i'm wondering why, and what impact (if any) it will have on my implementation."
