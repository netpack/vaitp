"i want to know is there any way represent a negative entity as a positive entity while we print on console in blank? usually i would use a statement as follows to make a negative entity positive while printing, ex lets juts say selling_price =4400 and cost_price = 4500, so following statement prints $100 loss instead of $-100:..system.out.println(""seller made rs""+-1*pr+"" of loss"")...is there any function that can do this or is there any other variation to this i can perform?"
