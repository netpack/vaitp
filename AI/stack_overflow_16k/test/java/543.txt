"creating an object to record a users score i am creating a quiz type console application which records the score of the user depending on the answer is correct or incorrect. i am wondering (because of multiple categories) would it be a better idea to create a score class instead of having it in the methods individually. if so, what would be the best way of implementing this. external resources also greatly welcomed..current the code is as follows..import blank.util.scanner;..public class dummyquiz {.    static scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.    static int score = 0;..    public static void category1().    {.        int answer1;.        system.out.println(""question 1"");.        system.out.println(""1) answer 1"");.        system.out.println(""2) answer 2"");.        answer1 = input.nextint();..        if(answer1 == 1).        {.            system.out.println(""correct!n"");.            score++;.        }.        else.        {.            system.out.println(""incorrectn"");.        }                     .    }//category1..    public static void main(string []args){..        category1();.        // output final score here..    }.}"
