"additional handling on blank set duplicate failure on add i'm accumulating unique objects in a hashset from multiple calls to a service method outside my control which returns a list&lt;record&gt;...an additional requirement is if any duplicates are found in this process, i need to generate an email. i could check for duplicates myself and keep a list&lt;record&gt; which inserts or skips, but then i wouldn't be using a set which does this automatically, from an external list. obviously there's no try/catch on set add failure, but is there a better way to do this?..hashset&lt;record&gt; set = new hashset&lt;record&gt;();.for (string org: orgs) {            .   // external service call.   list&lt;record&gt; result = service.getrecords(org); .   // add all to set (also need to detect duplicates with resulting logic).   set.addall(result);.}"
