"if option works but else if does not i have a method i am working on, its part of a larger program but i think the code i posted will be enough...when i select option 1 in my menu, it works as it should, but when i select option 2 , it just ends the program. can anybody spot the issue?..resolved : the choice == 1 should be 2...can i also add to this question, would it be best to put the in putted data into an array, if so, should i declare the array in the main class,superclass or the sub class..static void addbook(){.            string title,author;.            int choice;.            boolean onloan;.            loanbook book1; // testing only.            system.out.print(""press 1 for fiction or 2 for non fiction: "");  // sub menu for fiction and non fiction.            choice = keyboard.nextint();.            if (choice == 1){..                system.out.println(""please enter book title: "");.                title = keyboard.nextline();.                title = keyboard.nextline();.                system.out.println(""please enter book author: "");.                author = keyboard.nextline();.                onloan = false; // not used yet.                book1 = new fiction(title,author);.                system.out.println(book1.tostring());.        }.            else if (choice == 1) {.                system.out.println(""please enter book title: "");.                title = keyboard.nextline();.                title = keyboard.nextline();                ;.                system.out.println(""please enter book author: "");.                author = keyboard.nextline();.                onloan = false; // not used yet.                book1 = new nonfiction(title,author);.                system.out.println(book1.tostring());.            }..        }"
