unzipping the content of a file i have an application where service a will provide a zipped data to service b. and service b needs to unzip it...service a has an exposes method getstream and it gives bytearrayinputstream as output and the data init is zipped data. ..however passing that to gzipinputstream gives not in gzip format exception...inputstream ins = method.getinputstream();.gzipinputstream gis = new gzipinputstream(ins);...this gives an exception. when the file is dumped in service a the data is zipped. so getinputstream gives the zipped data...how to process it ans pass it to the gzipinputstream?..regards.dheeraj joshi
