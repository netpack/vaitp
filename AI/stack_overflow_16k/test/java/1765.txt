"my code is not printing out but working public class mythread{..    public mythread(int m) {.        super();.    }..    public void run() {.        for (int x = 0; x &lt; 201; x++) { .            system.out.println(""thread running"" + x );       .        } .    }..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        mythread mt = new mythread(200);.    }.}...the code runs, but it is not printing out. it is probably the constructor but the teacher told me to only make a public void run and a main method to allow the code to work. ..also let me know if i'm asking the wrong type of question, i tried looking at the 'how to ask questions' for better question asking."
