"timetable implementation in blank? i need a timetable class that would work like (a rough example to explain the idea):..timetable timetable = new timetable(""mon-fri 8:00-17:00"");.date eta = timetable.increment(new date(), 3, calendar.hours);...eta should be the point in time, which is exactly 3 hours ahead of current time, but only the time between 8:00 and 17:00 is taken into account. this may sound like an interview question, but i need such a class for a business purpose and i suspect that some open source implementation exists already."
