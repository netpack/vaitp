"jframe is loaded late my code is:..    solvedb_userfileinconsistency solve = new solvedb_userfileinconsistency();.    solve.setvisible(true);..    try {.        solve.solveit();.    } catch (instantiationexception e) {.        // todo auto-generated catch block.        e.printstacktrace();.    } catch (illegalaccessexception e) {.        // todo auto-generated catch block.        e.printstacktrace();.    } catch (classnotfoundexception e) {.        // todo auto-generated catch block.        e.printstacktrace();.    } catch (sqlexception e) {.        // todo auto-generated catch block.        e.printstacktrace();.    }...""solveit"" method returns after 30 seconds and until it returns, frame isn't installed properly but after solveit method returns, the frame gets installed properly but what i want is that before going into solveit method, the frame should be properly on the screen. is there any method that can wait the frame's installation and then calls that solveit method?"
