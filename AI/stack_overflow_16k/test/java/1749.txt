"change tls without changing the application server properties just like the title suggests, i am currently working on a sub-project of an enterprise application needing to change the tls version in my project. remember that my project is one of many projects running on the application server, so changing the system properties would change the property for all the projects running on that application server. so i would be appreciated if you could show me the way to change tls version without changing the system..thanks in advance"
