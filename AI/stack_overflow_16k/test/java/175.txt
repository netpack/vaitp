"convert string to byte array without encoding? so i have a string with binary data like this:..string lob = ""ÿøÿà..."";...i really have no control over this so i have to take it as it is.  so i need to convert this as an inputstream without changing it, if i just do:..getbytes()...it will use the default encoding, how do i do this without any encoding or modification?..edit:..i can't fix this from the source.   i do know the original data is a image loaded from html get, but i don't know how it was encoded during transfer .  all i have right now is a really long string and i need to convert it back and save it into a database."
