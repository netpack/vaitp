"collection implementation that mostly delegates to a class member i want to implement a collection that represents a sorted collection of items. the main reason i need a special collection instead of just calling sort() on a list is that i need specific behavior for the add() method to improve performance. the rest of the collection will mostly just delegate to a class member, probably an arraylist...is there a way to delegate part of the collection interface to my class member instead of having to write all the delegation by hand like this?..public void clear() {.    mylist.clear();.}..public int hashcode() {.    return mylist.hashcode().}....."
