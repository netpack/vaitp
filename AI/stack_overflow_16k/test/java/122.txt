"why is my code returning incorrect keys at a few stages? why am i getting discrepencies in the data returned like. it works fine till 3, then boom, it messes up until the end. what i am doing is simple. i am taking values from a txt file with id,name and matching the ids with another txt file that has name,name to make it appear like id, id, as you can see below. however, it doesn't work as you'd expect. the matching is being done fine till a point it messes up. ..0,1.1,3.0,2.0.3,0,4.2.3,0.4,2.4,1.2,.....while ((output2 = br2.readline()) != null) {..    string[] vv = output2.split("","");.    string value1 = vv[0];.    string value2 = vv[1];..    for (map.entry&lt;integer, string&gt; entry : map.entryset()) {.        int key = entry.getkey();.        string value = entry.getvalue();.                                    //system.out.println(key+"",""+value);..        if ((value1.equals(value))) {.            system.out.print(key + "","");..        }..        if ((value2.equals(value))) {.            system.out.print(key + ""n"");.        }..    }..}...data..ids.txt..0,triple h.1,john cena.2,megan fox.3,the undertaker.4,pamela anderson.5,the rock...text.txt..triple h,john cena.john cena,the undertaker,.triple h,megan fox.the undertaker,triple h"
