"subtracting the character before when it finds a specific letter          string secondline = ""...e......e..e.e"";...the secondline is in a txt file and therefore the e can be anywhere just after a dot depending on the number failed...in total there is meant to be just 12 of these but blank adds an e after the dot before to indicate that test was failed. i am a novice programmer and would like a loop that would go through that string to take off the dot before every e so i can integrate into my main application. the resulting output should look like this ..e.....e.ee  thank you in advance"
