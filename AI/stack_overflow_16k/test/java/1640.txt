"how can i output a new text file every time my program runs? i would like to know how i can make the program output a new text file every time it runs. for example first run machineslot(1).txt, second run machineslot(2).txt, and so forth. or, make the output file contain when the file was made...file file = new file(""machineslot.txt""); ..    try(printwriter out = new printwriter(new filewriter(file));) {..        for (int i = 0; i &lt; windata.length; i++){ ..            if (windata[i][0] != 0.0) {..            out.printf(""you won machine %.0f. you won $%.2f. you have %.0f quarters which equals $%.2f %n"", windata[i][0], windata[i][1], windata[i][2], windata[i][3]);..            }.        }..        for (int k = 0; k &lt; plays.length; k++).            out.println(""you were able to play machine "" + (k + 1) +"" a total of ""+ plays[k] + "" times."");.    }//end of try.      ..    catch(ioexception error){.        system.out.println(""could not use the io file"");.    }//end catch"
