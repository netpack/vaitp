"scan.nextline does not work i used blank and i tried to write program that reads a number of patients and then let the employee enter their names and ages...and i want the program reads full name such as (maha saeed) so i wrote the code like this but i don't know why it does not work ..name = scan.nextline();...and this is the full code..import blank.util.*;..public class answer1.{.static scanner scan = new scanner (system.in);.public static void main (string[] args).{..int age ; .int patientnumber ;.int patientno;.string name ;...system.out.print(""enter number of patients :"");..patientnumber =  scan.nextint();.patientno = 1;..while ( patientno &lt;= patientnumber).{.system.out.println(""patient #"" +patientno);.system.out.print(""enter patient's name: "");.name = scan.nextline(); //&lt;- here is the problem if i write scan.next it works but it reads only the first name..system.out.print(""enter patient's age: "");.age= scan.nextint();.patientno = patientno + 1;.}..}.}...thanks all"
