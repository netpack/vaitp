"static string in new object vs non static string does this makes a difference in memory consumption/performance?..private static final string name = ""text"";..    // new string is created and passed in new test-object.public test create1(){.    return new test(""text"");.}..    // static final string passed (as reference?) in new test-object.public test create2(){.    return new test(name);.}...imagine having 100000 objects, then for create1, a string is created every time. create2 does not create a new string every time. am i right?"
