"how to avoid ""duplicate class"" in blank suppose i have have a blank project myproject and am using an external library jar (somejar.jar), which has a class com.somepackage.class1.class...now i find an updated version of class1.blank which fixes a bug in the original jar...i include the new class1.blank in my source code under package com.somepackage..when i build the project (e.g., using netbeans), there is a distmyproject.jar which contains the classcom.somepackage.class1.class and a distlibsomejar.jar which also contains a class with the same name...when i run the file (e.g, using blank -jar distmyproject.jar), the new version of class1.class is used (as i want). ...how does blank decide which class file to run in case of such duplicates? is there any way i can specify precedence ?.is there any 'right' way to avoid such clashes? .in proguard, when i try to compress my code, i get a duplicate class error. how do i eliminate this?"
