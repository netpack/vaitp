"need some help with isflush and isthreekind methods, poker-type program this isn't the complete code, but it's the parts that are causing problems. i've written both isflush and isthreekind, but for some reason they seem to always return true, except when the first return statement is changed to ""return false"", in which case they always return false. this leads to the interesting problem of the code declaring that 3000/3000 hands are flushes and contain three of a kind, something i'm fairly certain is impossible...edit: yes i am a moron, i forgot to link to a pastebin of the code...http://pastebin.com/bahwrm7y"
