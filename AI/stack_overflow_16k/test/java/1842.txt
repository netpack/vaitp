"delete a folder in blank the folder i need to delete is one that is created from my program. the directory is not the same on every pc so the folder code i am using is ..userprofile+""\downloads\software_tokens""...there will be files in, so i guess i need to recursively delete it. i looked at some samples for that here but it never accepts my path. the path works fine in the code as an environmental variable, because i added code for it ..static string userprofile = system.getenv(""userprofile""); ..so can someone just show me the code with my path plugged please?"
