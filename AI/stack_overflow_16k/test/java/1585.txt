"getting a nullpointerexception on pop method i am beginning in linked stacks and i was wondering why is this part of the code giving me a nullpointerexception. the one thing i want to do in the main driver is to keep adding books until i enter stop when prompted. the push method seems to be working since on the top of the list in the output you can see that the book - 2 is on top. i've tried to approach it in other ways but it keeps giving me that exact error. note i have read the similar questions that appear when i wrote this one but i can't seem to find the problem...here's the code for both push and pop:..@override. public void push(t data). {. node&lt;t&gt; current = new node&lt;&gt;(data, top);. if(count == top.length). {.  expandcapacity();   . }. current.setnext(top);. top[count++] = current;.. }...heres where i am getting the problem pop method..@override.. public t pop(). {. t result;.. if(count == 0 || top == null ). {.     system.out.println(""list is empty"");. }.. result = top[count].getdata();. top =  top[count - 1].getnext();.. return result;. }...here's linkedstack's declarations and constructor..public class linkedstack&lt;t&gt; implements linkedinterface&lt;t&gt; {.. private int count;. private node&lt;t&gt; []top;. private static final int size = 5;... public linkedstack(). {.     top = (node&lt;t&gt;[]) (new node [size]);.     count = 0;.. }...here's the code of the node class..public class node&lt;t&gt; .{..private t data; .private node []next;..public node(t _data).{.data = _data;.}.public node(t _data, node []_next).{.data = _data;.next = _next;.}..public t getdata().{.return data;    .}..public void setdata(t _data).{.data = _data;    .}..public node[] getnext().{..return next;    ..}..public void setnext(node []_next).{. next = _next;   .}..}...output..note to stop adding books enter: 'stop' when prompted..book-1.enter title:.title1.author1.isbn1.10..do you wish stop adding books? n || stop.n.book-2.enter title:.title2.author2.isbn2.20..do you wish stop adding books? n || stop.stop.the books in list are:..title:title2.author/s: author2.isbn: isbn2.exception in thread ""main"" blank.lang.nullpointerexception.copies in stock: 20..    at node.linkedstack.pop(linkedstack.blank:133).    at node.bookdriver.main(bookdriver.blank:85).blank result: 1.build successful (total time: 36 seconds)"
