"unable to understand the logic behind this public class myclass.{.    public static void main(string args[]).    {.        boolean b=false;.        if(b=true).        {.            system.out.println(""true"");.        }.        if(b=false){.            system.out.println(""false"");.        }.    }.}...although it might seem to be a very simple problem for the most of you, but i am unable to understand that when i run this code the output is true...since = is an assignment operator so therefore in both the cases it should come out to be true, since the values are assigned i.e. if(b=true) = true (valid) and if(b=false) = true (valid). and since there is no else condition in this therefore it should give both true and false as the outputs."
