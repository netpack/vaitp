"how to make sure my ""database"" doesn't break if i add functionality in the future in my app, i store data to a file using serializable. the file contains a map of dictionaryentry objects, a class i made myself. i noticed that when i added fields to that class, it broke my existing file in the sense that it would read it. the compiler threw an error ( i can't remember which one). the fields of dictionaryentry contains some important fields that i absolutely cannot lose, so how would i go about adding more fields and methods to my dictionaryentry class in the future without all my data being deleted? ..edit: here is the error i got when i added a new field ..blank.io.invalidclassexception: logic.dictionaryentry; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialversionuid = -637986868145725934, local class serialversionuid = 1552091926235600295"
