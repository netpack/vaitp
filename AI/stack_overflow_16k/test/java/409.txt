"printing with blank, how to mix ""%.2f"", variables, and regular strings on same print line? what is a better way to get the same output as the following code, but without all the system.out repeats?..whenever i try to combine it all one one line, the printf or println wants something else and i get an error with netbeans...    system.out.print(""thank you."" + ""n"" + ""the resulting tip is "");.    system.out.printf(""%.2f"", tip);.    system.out.print("" and the total is "");.    system.out.printf(""%.2f"", total);.    system.out.println(""."");...i'm trying to use the following on one line, how to include it on a single print attempt?..(""thank you."" + ""n"" + ""the resulting tip is "" + ""%.2f"", tip + ""and the total is "" %.2f"", total + ""."");...the program is a tip calculator, and i want to get the decimals rounded to two (ie xx.yy)."
