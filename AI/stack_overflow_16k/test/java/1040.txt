"how do i get started using blank for web development? ok, here's the easiest question for the day for those of you who have ever done this. i'm learning blank and i heard that blank can be used to build websites. i am coming from a php background, so i would really appreciate using a strongly-typed well-designed language like blank for web development. however, either i can't get my search keywords right, or there's not a single guide out there that will explain what i actually need to do to build websites in blank...for php, i would need to install apache and php, or a nice package like wamp, and start putting php files in the web root. ..what is blank's equivalent?"
