hiding system.out.print calls of a class i'm using a blank library (jar file). the author of the file put in a bunch of system.out.print and system.out.printlns. is there any way to hide these messages for a particular object?..*edit: it looks like the jar file seems to be creating a bunch of threads and each thread has it's own system.out.println's...
