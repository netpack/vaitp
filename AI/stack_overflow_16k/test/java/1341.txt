"trying to read text line by line and write into output file each line in blank i am trying to read data from a text file (line by line) and i want to write into output file the lines i read from the flies...here is how i programmed my code:..import blank.io.bufferedreader;.import blank.io.bufferedwriter;.import blank.io.filenotfoundexception;.import blank.io.filereader;.import blank.io.filewriter;.import blank.io.ioexception;...public class read {..    public static void main(string args[]).    {.        string input = null;.        input = readfile();.        writefile(input);..    }.    public static void writefile(string in).    {.        string filename = ""output.txt"";.    //string payload = null;.     try {.        filewriter fw = new filewriter(filename);.        bufferedwriter bw =new bufferedwriter(fw);  .        bw.write(in);                       .        system.out.println(""received ""+in.length()+"" bytes: "");  .        bw.close();.     }.     catch(ioexception ex) {.        system.out.println(""error writing to file '""+ filename + ""'"");.     }..    }...    public static string readfile().    {.        string filename = ""temp.txt"";.        string line = null;.        string sentence = null;.        try {            .        filereader fr = new filereader(filename);.        bufferedreader br = new bufferedreader(fr);.        while((line = br.readline()) != null) {.            //sentence += line+'n';.            sentence = line +'n';.        }.        br.close();.        system.out.println(""sending file ""+filename);.        return sentence;.        }.        catch(filenotfoundexception ex) {.            system.out.println(.
