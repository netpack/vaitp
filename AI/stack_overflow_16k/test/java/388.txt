"external method call help so what im trying to do is to call an external method upon an object, its a bit trickier than i expected and am having problems properly implementing it..the method is:..attack(player victim)..the method needs to call a hit() method on an object; then if the hit() method was successful (test this through a boolean?):...use an if statement to call a damage() method upon the object to determine the damage.call takedamage() upon (playervictim) to inflict the damage....here's the player class that ive coded so far; the attack() method is at the bottom..my main question is how to use an external method(s) damage() on the currentweapon  and takedamage() on player victim..public class player.{.   private string myplayername;.   private weapon myweapon;.   private int mycurrenthealth;.   private int mymaxhealth;.   private int mynumpotions;...    /**.     * constructor initializing class player.     * parameters of the player should be:.     * player name, players initial health, the players weapon..     */.    public player(string myplayer, int initialhealth, weapon currentweapon) {.        myplayername = myplayer;.        this.myweapon = currentweapon;.        mymaxhealth = 30; .        mycurrenthealth = initialhealth;.        mynumpotions = 0;       .    }..    /**.     * attack method which attacks opposing player.     * with current equipped weapon..     */.    public void attack(player victim) {.        currentweapon.hit();.        if (boolean currentweapon.hit() = true) {.            currentweapon.damage(int dam);.            return dam;..        }.        player victim.takedamage(int damage);..    }...}...and the weapon class:..import blank.util.random;.public class weapon.{.    private int myhitprob;.    private int mymaxdamage;.    private random myrng;..    /**.     * create a new weapon with a hit probability and damage.     */.    public weapon(int hitprob, int damage) {.        myhitprob = hitprob;.        mymaxdamage = damage;.        myrng = new random();.    }..    public boolean hit() {..        int r = myrng.nextint(100);..        if (r &lt; myhitprob) {.            return true;.        }.        else {.            return false;.        }.    }..    public int damage() {.        int dam = myrng.nextint(mymaxdamage) + 1;        .        return dam;.    }.}"
