"throwing exception instead of returning value i came across a code i needed to return a boolean for checking the term of case, i'll show an example:..let's say i have a carchecker class that has public boolean checkcompability(car car) but i want to return the reason the reason the car wasn't compatible.  ..first solution introduced was creating   ..public class compabilityresult {.    private boolean iscompatible;.    private string reason;.}...and then reformat the function to:  ..public compabilityresult checkcompabilty(car car)...second solution was reformat the function to :   ..public void checkcompability(car car) throws incompatibleexception...and in case of incompatible car we would use the exception message...i know there isn't a ""better"" solution here, since both achiveing the same result.    ..i really wanted to know what would be the best use cases and best practices when throwing exceptions from my own code, since functions like the one above seems more straight-forward to me when they are returning a value...thanks!"
