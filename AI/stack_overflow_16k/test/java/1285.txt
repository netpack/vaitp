"cannot find symbol length (blank) given an array of numbers, i have to return the number of times that 9 appears in the array. i created a new array, where i added all the 9s from the original array. but at the end when i want to return the length of the new array, i get an error ""cannot find symbol length""..i know that in this case, length is an attribute, not a method, so that's not the problem. i even used the length attribute in the for loop and it doesn't seem to be a problem (because the error occurs at line 8). this is starting to become frustrating. if anyone knows what the reason for this is, please let me know...public int arraycount9(int[] nums) {.    arraylist&lt;integer&gt; array = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();.    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++){.        if (nums[i] == 9){.            array.add(nums[i]);.        }.    }.    int len = array.length;.    return len;.}"
