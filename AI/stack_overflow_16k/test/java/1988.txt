"imports vs. class hierarchy in blank hi i am a beginner in blank..i just read about class hierarchy-..blank.lang.object.   blank.awt.component.       blank.awt.container.           blankx.swing.jcomponent..also, class object is the root of the class hierarchy. every class has object as a superclass...if object class is the superclass then why we import every class seperately in blank ?.wouldn't be it sufficient to import just blank.lang.object ?"
