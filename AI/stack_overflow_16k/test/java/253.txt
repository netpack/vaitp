"blank counting method? i need to write some code that will count the amount of times someone has borrowed a cd. i tried doing some but just failed and don't have a clue any more...like i said, stuck again on something that is probably simple to do:..  public void borrower(string nameofborrower)./**. * . */.{.   borrower = nameofborrower;.   borrowed = true;.   instock = false;.}..public void returned()./**. * . */.{.   borrower = """";.   borrowed = false;.   instock = true;.}..public boolean isborrowed()./**. * . */.{.   return borrowed;.}..public void reportinstock()./**. * . */.{.    if(instock == false).    {.        system.out.println(""this cd has been borrowed;"" + personname);.    }.    else.    {.        system.out.println(""this cd is available"");.    }.}"
