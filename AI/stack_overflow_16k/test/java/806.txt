"what does ""zero-extend"" mean? i was looking at the blankdoc for the charsequence interface, implemented by string, stringbuferand a few others, more specifically at the chars() method, and the blankdoc says...  returns a stream of int zero-extending the char values from this.  sequence....now, i know that it returns int values, and that int that can be cast to char. but what does ""zero-extending"" mean?"
