"printing out objects i want to print out the individual values of my objects.say i just want to print firstname of one the objects, not of all of them, how would i do this?. you will see in the code i never gave my objects individual names so how would i refer to them?..i have already added the string override method thing. ..i am not sure what the names of my objects would be so i can't refer to them individually. ..i have a seperate class with the student object, and the readfile method is reading a text file and creating a new object...so how would i refer to this objects using system.out.println?..public static boolean readfile(string filename) .{ .    file file = new file(filename);..    try.    {.          list&lt;student&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;&gt;();   .          scanner scanner = new scanner(file);.          while(scanner.hasnextline()).        {.              string[] words = scanner.nextline().split("","");.              list.add(new student(words[0],words[1],words[2], new string[ {words[3],words[4],words[5],words[6],words[7]} ]);.        }.    } .    catch (filenotfoundexception e)   .    { .        system.out.println(""failed to read file"");.      }.      return true;..}..    public static void main(string[] args) . {.        readfile(""c:\temp\studentdata.txt"");.        displaymenu();      .    }..    private static void displayreportbymarks() .   {.          system.out.println(student.id);.     }...cannot make static reference to non static field."
