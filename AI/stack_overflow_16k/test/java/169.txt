"blank calculator (need assistance for my first project) this is my first try on blank. the project is a calculator that takes a number, an operator signal (+,-,*,/), and another number to create an equation and give the final value of it, asking after that if the user wants to restart the program for another equation or not. i would like to know if there is anything that i can do to improve my code..thanks!../*.name: felipe de araujo.project #: 1.*/..import blank.util.scanner; //importing api...public class calculator {.public static void main(string[] args){.    int a = 1; //creating variable for the first while loop..    system.out.println(""welcome to the calculator!""); //program introduction...    while (a == 1){.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in); //creating the input...        double firstnumber, secondnumber, result; char operator; //creating all variables...        //program asking for the first number..        system.out.print(""first number: "");.        firstnumber = input.nextdouble();..        //program asking for the operator.        system.out.print(firstnumber + "" (+,-,*,/): "");.        operator = input.next(""."").charat(0);..        int repeat = 1; //creating variable for the next while loop...        //evaluating the operator to determine if it is inside the criteria (+,-,*,/)..        if (operator == '+' || operator == '-' || operator == '*' || operator == '/'){.            system.out.print(firstnumber + "" "" + operator + "" second number: ""); //if the operator is inside the criteria than start.                                                                                 //asking for the second number..        }.        else { //if the operator is not inside the criteria run the loop until the user type something that is..            while (repeat == 1){.                system.out.print(operator + "" not recognized, please select between (+,-,*,/): "");.                operator = input.next(""."").charat(0);.                if (operator == '+' || operator == '-' || operator == '*' || operator == '/') {.                    system.out.print(firstnumber + "" "" + operator + "" second number: "");..                    repeat++;.                }.            }.        }..        secondnumber = input.nextdouble(); //initialize the secondnumber variable to the number typed...        //equalling the variable result to the return given by the method calculatormethod, with the variables given..        result = calculatormethod(firstnumber, secondnumber, operator);.        system.out.println(firstnumber + "" "" + operator + "" "" + secondnumber + "" = "" + result);//printing the equation..        system.out.println("" "");..        // asking the user to continue the program for another operation..        char out;//creating the variable out..        system.out.print(""[y/y] - continue | [n/n] or any other to end program: "");.        out = input.next(""."").charat(0);//initializing the variable out to what was typed...        //verifying if the user wants to continue the program..        if (out == 'y' || out == 'y'){.            system.out.println("" "");.        }.        else {//if the users type anything besides y/y the program will exit the main loop, ending the program..            system.out.println(""bye!"");.            a++;.        }.    }.}..//declaring the calculatormethod and all its behaviors..private static double calculatormethod(double a, double b, char c){..    if (c == '+'){.        return a + b;.    }.    else if (c == '-'){.        return  a - b;.    }.    else if (c == '*'){.        return a * b;.    }.    else {.        return a / b;.    }.}...}"
