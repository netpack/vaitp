"bank account program i am working on making a program to simulate bank transactions. i have to ask the user if they want to deposit, withdrawal, or transfer...when i deposit a certain amount (for example 1000), it says my balance is 1000. then i ask to withdrawal a number like 400 it says my balance is -400. after all that i thought maybe i have to check my balance and then it will give me the correct balance of what should be 600, but it says 0.  for instance, see this transcript:....i was thinking because in my code (shown below) i made the balance = 0 but if i take the = 0 away and try to run the program it says it needs to be initialized...i am stuck and i want to figure it out. please don't post the entire code corrected. i want to fix it myself and learn!..import blank.util.scanner;..public class banktransactions {...    public static void main(string[] args) {..        scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.        int num;..        do {..            double balance = 0;.            double amount;..            system.out.println(""type number"");.            system.out.println(""1. deposit"");.            system.out.println(""2. withdrawal"");.            system.out.println(""3. balance"");.            system.out.println(""4. exit"");.            num = scan.nextint();..            if (num == 1) {.                system.out.println(""enter amount to deposit: "");.                amount = scan.nextdouble();..                // add the amount to the balance.                balance += amount;.                system.out.println(""your balance is"");.                system.out.println(balance);...            } else if (num == 2) {..                system.out.println(""enter amount to withdrawal: "");.                amount = scan.nextdouble();..                // remove the amount from the balance.                balance -= amount;.                system.out.println(""your balance is"");.                system.out.println(balance);..            } else if (num == 3) {...                system.out.println(""your balance"");.                system.out.println(balance);..            }....        } while (num != 4);..        system.out.println(""good bye!"");..    }.}"
