"variable being calculated in one method isn't going to another i'm taking a blank class and i've been working on this program that is to calculate credit card balance based on information input through a gui. in my output finance charge, new balance, and new payment due are all coming out as 0. i've tried adding 5 to pinpoint where i messed up and it seems that ""balance"" isn't being referenced correctly when calculating newbalance. i assume that finance charge also has the same issue but fixing balance will help me fix that as well...//calculates balance.        public float calculatebalance().        {.            balance = previousbalance + currentpurchases - payments - creditsreturns + latefees+ 5;..            return balance;.        }..        //sets finance charge.        public void setfinancecharge(float financecharge).        {.            double periodicrate;.            periodicrate = .12/12;.            float d = (float)periodicrate;.            financecharge = balance * d;.        }..        //gets finance charge.        public float getfinancecharge().        {.            return financecharge;.        }..    //method to calculate new balance.    public float calculatenewbalance().    {.        //calculate the new balance.        newbalance = balance+financecharge+5;..        return newbalance;.    }..    //setes new payment due.    public void setpaymentdue(double newpayment).    {.        newpayment = newbalance * .10;.        this.paymentdue = (float)newpayment;            .    }..    //gets new payment due.    public float getpaymentdue().    {.        return paymentdue;.    }..    //method to display results.    public void displayoutput().    {.        if (overcreditlimit == 0).        {.        joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null,.
