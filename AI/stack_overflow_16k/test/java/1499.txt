"do while loop with condition in header and footer my compiler eats this:..    do while (condition1) {.        // do something.    } while (condition2);...oracle does not explicitly say it is possible http://docs.oracle.com/blankse/tutorial/blank/nutsandbolts/while.html, but my compiler accepts the two conditions. does this actually work or is there a reason why i cannot do this?..the construct makes perfect sense as often we have two conditions, like a counter and an object, where only one of these conditions needs to be checked right away when entering the loop...i know that i could use an if statement and break; - i just wanted to learn if there is a reason why i should not use the two criteria."
