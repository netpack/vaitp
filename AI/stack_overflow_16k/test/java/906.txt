"blank util linked list - how to find next? when using blank linkedlist how do you find out the element's next or previous relationships?..i mean, in a regular linked list i would do something like this:..node node1 = new node();.node node2 = new node();.linkedlist list = new linkedlist();.list.add(node1);.list.add(node2);..//then my node1 will know who it's next is:.assertequals(node2, node1.next());...where node is my own container for data/object...but in blank's linkedlist, the data does not seem to be modified. so how do i actually find out who the ""next"" (or ""previous"" in the case of doubly-linked lists) element is?"
