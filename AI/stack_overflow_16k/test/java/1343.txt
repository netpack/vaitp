"blank garbage collection eligibility i am preparing for ocjp exam. i am giving a mock test. here is a code snippet...public class gc {.    private object o;..    private void dosomethingelse(object obj) {.        o = obj;.    }..    public void dosomething() {.        object obj = new object(); // line 5.        dosomethingelse(obj);      // line 6.        obj = new object();        // line 7.        dosomethingelse(null);     // line 8.        obj = null;                // line 9.    }.}...when the dosomething method is called, after which line does the object obj become available for garbage collection?..i know the answer is line 9 , however according to  the exam simulator it is line 8 ?  i am not sure who is right ?"
