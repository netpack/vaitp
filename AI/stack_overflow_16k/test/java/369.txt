"how to deal with scanner exception basically i am taking a string input that represents a file.  that file can contain integers, doubles or random strings.  i am trying to iterate through the file adding all the integers and then taking the average of all of them.  the issue i'm stuck on is when i get something other than an integer.  i don't know how i am supposed to catch and deal with the error and then iterate onto the next part of the file.  i can't use if statements and i'm thoroughly stuck.  .. string storevariables = null;.  filereader filereader;.  bufferedreader bufferedreader;.  scanner scanner = null;.  int total = 0;.  int itterate = 0;...  try{.      filereader = new filereader(filename);.      bufferedreader = new bufferedreader(filereader);.      scanner = new scanner(bufferedreader);..      while(scanner.hasnextint()){.          total += scanner.nextint();..          itterate++;.      }..  }. catch(exception e){... }       ..  return total/itterate;...}"
