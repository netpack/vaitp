"merging treemaps with common key i have 5 treemaps. in which the key value is same for all treemaps in the range from 0-20 seconds. the value in the treemap differs. i jus want to add the values(values are string, not integer addition)...how is this possible? ..for example..treemap1 :..time(key) , co-ordinate(value).1,(1,1).2,(2,4).....20 (8,5)...treemap2 :..time(key) , co-ordinate(value).1,(1,5).2,(9,4).....20 (5,6).......treemap5 :..time(key) , co-ordinate(value).1,(4,4).2,(8,1).....20 (7,4)....output:..treemap :..time(key) , co-ordinate(value).1,(1,1)+(1,5)+(4,4).2,(2,4)+(9,4) +(8,1).....20 (8,5)+(5,6)+(7,4)...i know, i dont have the code, but i want an idea, how i should write a code for this, so i have asked. please dont mark it negative due to absence of code."
