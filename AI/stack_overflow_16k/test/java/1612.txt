"how to use a previously initialised object in a different class? i have a class (checkhotel) holding an object (hotel) which contains a set of objects nested within (room within hotel, bed within room). they all already have values set and i'd like to use these objects with these values in a different class, but i've been unable to find a way to do it. ..my object:..static class hotel {.    [...].    class room {.        [...].        class bed {.            [...].        }.    }.}...the method of the other class (buildreport) that i'm trying to pass it to:..public static void createreport(hotel hotel) {.    [...].}...and the line i'm trying to use to call that method (in checkhotel):..buildreport.createreport(hoteln);...hoteln being the name of the object of hotel that i want to move across. doing that pulled up the error:..'the method createreport(hotel) from the type buildreport refers to the missing type hotel'...in the main class, and ..'hotel cannot be resolved as a type' ...in the parameters of the method i'm trying to call...i'm using eclipse, which recommended adding:..import checkhotel.hotel;...to buildreport, but that just created the following error:..'the import checkhotel cannot be resolved'...does anybody have any idea how to fix this? the only solutions online that i've been able to find were for just creating a brand new instance of the object in the new class, but i need to use the object with the same values that i already have."
