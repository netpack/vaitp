"swapping object references in the method in blank you can't do that without either wrapping into other objects or using arrays. this doesn't work...a; // object@12345.b; // object@56789.swap(a, b);.a; // object@12345.b; // object@56789..void swap(object a, object b) {.     object temp = a;.     a = b;.     b = temp;.}...but is there really no way to change the reference? or can it be achieved using some unsafe workaround?"
