"recursion cannot get this right we have triangle made of blocks. the topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) the total number of blocks in such a triangle with the given number of rows. ..triangle(0) → 0.triangle(1) → 1.triangle(2) → 3...this is my code:..public int triangle(int rows) {.  int n = 0;..  if (rows == 0) {.    return n;.  } else {.    n = n + rows;.    triangle(rows - 1);.  }.}"
