"understanding basic for-each loops blank in blank, i know that on this site, topics such as for-each or enhanced for loops have been covered before, but i don't still really get how they work...for example,..string[] a = { ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"" }; .string b = """"; ..for (string q : a) .    b = q + b; ..system.out.println(b);...what would b output? .could you tell me how this is so? .thank you."
