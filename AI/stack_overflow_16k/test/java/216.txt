"confusion about creating a class array suppose i have two classes in a blank package:..class1.blank and class2.blank..so, if in class1.blank, i do the following:..public class2[] qr;..public static int x = 10;...then later on somewhere in the code:..qr = new class2[x];...so basically, i will be passing value 10 to class2 , right? please correct me if i have not understood it properly."
