"necessary to escape a blank regular expression in matches()? i'm currently doing a test on an http origin to determine if it came from ssl:..(httpheaders.names.origin).matches(""/^https:\/\//"")...but i'm finding it's not working. do i need to escape matches() strings like a regular expression or can i leave it like https://? is there any way to do a simple string match?..seems like it would be a simple question, but surprisingly i'm not getting anywhere even after using a regex tester http://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/blank/index.html. thanks."
