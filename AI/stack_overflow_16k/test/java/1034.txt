"count[i] holds frequency for each character from a string how can i print only max count[i] from it in blank i am trying to print max repeated character from a string as output instead i am printing frequency of each character from string, please help me to print only maximum count and also if count[i] max value matches other characters i need to print that too. for example.aabbc .for this i am getting output as a = 2 b = 2 c = 1.but output would be a = 2 b = 2 .. int   counter[] = new int[256];.    scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.println(""enter the string  :"");.    string str = scan.next();.    for(int i = 0;i&lt;str.length();i++){.        // count frequency of every character and store.        // it in counter array.        counter[(int) str.charat(i)]++;.        //system.out.println(str.charat(i));.    }.    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++) {.        //system.out.println(counter[i]);.        if (counter[i] != 0) {.            system.out.print("" ""+(char) i + "" = "" + counter[i]);..             /*int ch = counter[i];.             system.out.println(ch);*/.            /*for(int b : counter[i]){..            }*/..        }.    }"
