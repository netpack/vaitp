"how to write to a file without changing the characters? i developed an application that encrypts text entered into a jtextarea area and displays the output in another jtextarea and this worked correctly. i'm trying to modify the program so that input is given from a text file and the output is saved to another text file. ..in the previous version if the word ""hello"" was the input it will result ""177s7ppli"", but in the modified version(same code for encrypting) the output written is the file is ""15sppli"" and in netbeans output console it is .""1 5s ppli"". i guess this is because the encoding of jtextarea is different. how can i write the same output as previous to a file?..code used to read a file..public static string readfile2(string path){.        file f = new file(path);.        bufferedreader br = null;.        bufferedreader brc = null;..        string content = new string();.        int lines = 0;..         try {.             string scurrentline;...             br = new bufferedreader(new filereader(f));.             brc = new bufferedreader(new filereader(f));..             while ((scurrentline = br.readline()) != null) {.                 lines++;.         }..             for (int i = 0; i &lt; lines; i++) {.                 scurrentline = brc.readline();.                 content = content.concat(scurrentline);.                 content = content.concat(""rn"");.             }..         } catch (exception e) {.         }.        return content;.     }"
