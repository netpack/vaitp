"customizing synchronized in blank i know this is kind of wired requirement and i can achieve the below requirement with various locks available in blank.but i want to minimize the effort in development...requirement: my existing code base uses synchronized keyword in method level for thread safety in various places. now the same code base can be used by multiple tenant, so we have make the synchronizations also to be tenant aware...possible solutions:...change code to use different lock for different tenant and change every method to add the lock in start and unlock in the end..somehow customize the synchronized keyword to customsynchronized keyword and will behave tenant aware manner....i know the solution 1 will definitely work but it will be hell lot of code changes, so i need help from the expert if the solution 2 is possible at all, even if it is complex...now:.. public synchronized void method1(){.    // some processing on share object.}...tryying to make:.. public customsynchronized void method1(){.    // some processing on share object.}"
