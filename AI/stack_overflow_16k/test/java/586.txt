"parallel and non-parallel execution of tasks i am creating a system which will perform few kinds of operation upon receiving commands from user. some of the commands are:...acknowledgement (if user asks how are you, she returns back).temperature (returns current temperature).photo capturing (takes some pictures).video capturing (take a video)...the system has a camera so the last two tasks cannot be performed in parallel. but while capturing the images it can sense the temperature and return it back to the user...i think to implement it i need to have some kind of parallel and non-parallel executions of tasks. i don't know if there is something in blank concurrency exists which i can use to achieve this. i am not asking for any code. any pointer on how it can be done will be very helpful for me."
