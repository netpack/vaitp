"what is the better way to store fixed no of data in blank? (array vs arraylist) i believe array and arraylist both are non-synchronised;behave same in multithreaded env. .and both are index based. only adavantage is arraylist has utility methods and flexible.  .apart from those utility methods only to get and set fixed no of objects which is best in blank? is there any overhead in using arraylist than array? pls explain...let us consider scenario like ..1) 1,00,000 objects to be stored..2) 1,00,000 primitives to be stored"
