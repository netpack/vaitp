"blank split a paragraph by periods .i'm trying to build up a regular expression which splits a paragraph in sentences separated by a period (.). that should work:..string str[] = text.split(""\."");...however i'd need to add a minimum of robustness, for example checking that the period is followed by a space and an uppercase letter..so here's my next guess:..string text=""the pen is on the table. the table has a pen upon it."";.string arr[] = text.split(""\. [a-z]"");..for (string s: arr).    system.out.println(s);..output:.the pen is on the table.he table has a pen upon it....unfortunately, i'm missing the first character after the period. can you see any way it can be fixed?"
