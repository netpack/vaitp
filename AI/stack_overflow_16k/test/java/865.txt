"how to run blank program from flash drive that has classes in package, from command line? i have an assignment where i have to submit my code in flash drive. ..i did all coding in eclipse and getting all output. i tried running it through command line and it works. i copied all blank files and class files to flash drive and tried again through command line it works in my laptop. but when i take that dive and put it my desktop computer and run through command line, it can not recognise the classes that are in the package...i have a package a1.cis568 under this package i have several classes. main class is a1 and other classes are circle, point, planecircle, ehashtable, chashtable in the same package...i have to use following line on command line to compile and run my program through flash drive, (don't have to change any classpath while doing so)..e:&gt;        .e:&gt;blankc -d . a1.blank        .e:&gt;blank a1.cis568.a1...when i was searching for solution i found that i can install jdk on flash drive and run the code. i tried installing jdk but it doesn't solve my problem."
