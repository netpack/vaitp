"comparing a scanner input to elements in an array i am new to blank so forgive me if i am making a very simple mistake. i am attempting to make shop within a text based adventure game. i have created an array shopitems which stores a list of items as strings that the shop can sell. here is a part of the method i use for the user to make purchases within the game...string request = s.nextline().tolowercase();            .        for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; shopitems.length ; i++).        {.            if(request.equalsignorecase(shopitems[i])).            {.                system.out.println(""we have this item in stock! that will be "" + itemprice[i] + "" gold, "".                        + ""would you like to purchase this item?"");.                string command2 = s.nextline().tolowercase();.                if(command2.equals(""yes"") || command2.equals(""y"")).                {.                    if (savings &gt;= itemprice[i]).                    {.                        system.out.println(""congratulations! you have purchased "" + shopitems[i] + "". thank you "".                                + ""for your business."");.                        savings = savings - itemprice[i];.                        inv.add(shopitems[i]);.                        magicshoppurchase();.                    }..                    else if (savings &lt; itemprice[i]).                    {.                        system.out.println(""i'm sorry, you don't have enough gold to purchase this item! try "".                                + ""again when you have enough!"");..                    }.                }.            }.            else if(request.equals(""leave"")).            {.                system.out.println(""thank you! please come again soon!"");.                inmagicshop();.            }.            else.            {.                system.out.println(""i'm sorry, we don't have any of those in stock at the moment. would you "".                        + ""like to purchase a different item?"");.                string command2 = s.nextline().tolowercase();.                if(command2.equals(""yes"") || command2.equals(""y"")).                {.                    magicshoppurchase();.                }.                else if(command2.equals(""no"") || command2.equals(""n"")).                {.                    system.out.println(""thank you! please come again soon!"");.                    inmagicshop();.                }.                else.                {.                    system.out.println(""haha, you kiss your mother with that mouth? come back some other time!"");.                    inmagicshop();.                }.            }.        }...i am trying to compare the scanner input with shopitems to check if the item that the user wants to purchase is available in the shop, however it does not recognize any of the elements in shopitems. am i doing something wrong with this method/is there a mistake somewhere? this is my first post here so please forgive me if i have left out anything important...edit  ..first is where i call the method to store elements into shopitems...try {.    itemlist = new string(files.readallbytes(paths.get(""c:\users\gravy_000\desktop\software development 1\gameproject\src\hallsim\magicitems.txt"")));.    read(itemlist);.} catch (ioexception e) {.    e.printstacktrace();.}...second is the method i used to read the text file and store it into shopitems...public static void read(string shoplist) {.    shopitems = shoplist.split(""\r?\n"");.}...here is a link to the text file in dropbox.https://www.dropbox.com/s/rbfsr1fj2yzus1q/magicitems.txt?dl=0"
