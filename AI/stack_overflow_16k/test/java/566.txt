"how can i load a webpage in a blank console application and click a button in that webpage programatically? i want to load a webpage in a blank console application, fill some text fields, and submit it by clicking a submit button. is there any blank library available for doing this?..earlier i tried loading an ie object using powershell from a blank program. it worked well in some cases but i was getting some problems while loading webpages with multiple iframes, so i had to drop that approach and try thinking of a solution fully in blank."
