"nextline() method not waiting for scanning(reading) from the user in this challenge, you must read an integer, a double, and a string from stdin, then print the values according to the instructions in the output format section below. ..input format..there are three lines of input:..-the first line contains an integer..-the second line contains a double..-the third line contains a string..output format..there are three lines of output:..-on the first line, print string: followed by the unaltered string read from stdin..-on the second line, print double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin..-on the third line, print int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin...source code..import blank.util.scanner;..public class solution {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.        int i = scan.nextint();.        double d = scan.nextdouble();.        string s = scan.nextline();..        // write your code here...        system.out.println(""string: "" + s);.        system.out.println(""double: "" + d);.        system.out.println(""int: "" + i);.    }.}...input..100.42...after inputting double it shows the ouput as follows..output:..string: .double: 42.0.int: 100"
