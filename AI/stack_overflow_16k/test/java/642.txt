blank program not sure where and how to execute main method whilst using static boolean i've recently started using blank and i am trying to make a program that checks to see if an array can be changed to ascending order by returning true/false. ..that is the gist of it however i am having problems with the main class. the error i am getting is that the main method is not found in class...public static boolean solution (int[] a){. int count = 0;.........................for(int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++).    {.        if(a[i] != b[i]) count++;.    }.    if(count &gt; 2) return false;.    return true;.  }.  }...since i am doing this as my blank summer homework i am abit confused as to where i should add the main method. i know it is supposed to be ..public static void main (string args[])...however if i were to add that from the start of the code after the class i get errors. is it because i cannot have ..public static boolean and public static void main ...in the same class?..thanks.
