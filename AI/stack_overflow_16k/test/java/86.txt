"does there exist a tool for combining blank files i am joining a competition that requires me to put all my blank classes in one single .blank file. does there exist a tool that does this for me (including changing the visibility of classes to be able to do this)?..addition: thanks for trying to help me to read the site of the competition but i quote:...  it is possible to make more than one.  class for your program, but you will.  have to put the source for all classes.  in a single .blank file (the compiler.  will produce multiple .class files.  anyway). when you do this, you should.  not declare your classes public, or.  the compiler will complain about it....so, only 1 .blank file is allowed (no jar) and in that file i can have multiple non-public classes besides my public main class (and not only static inner classes as suggested)."
