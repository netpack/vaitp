"print raw string in blank say i have a string like this:..string message = ""hi n prakash"";...i want to print messsage exactly the way it is rather than printing a newline for n..so the desired output is:..hi n prakash...and not..hi. prakash...please note that we are not allowed to modify the string message. how do i do this?..edit: i've used n just as an example. there could be similar characters like t which could possibly be in my string."
