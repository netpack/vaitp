"how do i turn an input string's characters to lowercase? i am trying to create the following program in which i need to turn the input string's characters into lowercase to ease my work...i tried using tolowercase(); first but it didn't work. then i tried using tolowercase(locale); and yet i have not succeeded...public static void  mensuration() {.    locale locale = locale.english;.    scanner inputz = new scanner(system.in);.    system.out.println(""which kind of shape's formula would you like to find out.2d or 3d?"");.    char dimension = inputz.nextline().charat(0);.    if(dimension == '2') {system.out.println(""okay so which shape?"");.    string dimensiond = inputz.nextline().tolowercase(locale);.    if(dimensiond == ""rectangle"") {system.out.println(""area = length x breadthnperimeter = 2(length + breadth)"");}.        }.        }...i expected the program to give the accurate output but the thing that happens is that there is no output actually!!"
