"how to write the ""resize"" function for a self-defined arraylist class? so this would be my class:..public class listarray {.     private string[] array;.     private int numelements;..     public void resize{..     }...what's the best way to resize ""array""?..i was thinking doing something like this.. string newarray = new string[array.size]. for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++){.      newarray[i] = array[i];. }. array = new string[array.size *10]; //resize to 10x original size...then copying everything over from newarray to the ""new"" array...but that seems very inefficient. are there better ways?"
