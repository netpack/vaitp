"need help parsing out a file into two key fields per line i am trying to write a blank method that will parse out a text file one line at a time. in the following example i want to take the number at the front of the line and use that as one key value and the the ffm number as the next key field up until the alpha numeric characters which in the following cases is ch which is not part of the key sequence...  107458982                                                       ffm00000000000713432ch...once the keys are separated then i want to take them and make one key field...so in the end each line will have a key field that is actually 19 bytes long. this is what the key field looks like at the end of each line. i want to push these key fields on to an arraylist so that i can compare them to another txt file that has similar type structures. i thought that this would be easy but it is turning out a lot harder than i thought that it might be...    key filed --&gt; 107458982ffm00000000000713432 ...my text file, in this case, has a blank line on every other line so i need to just skip a blank line which is not in my code below...question: how would i parse this file out as simple and quickly as possible into my key fields which will make my single key?..code:..private arraylist&lt;string&gt; scannerread4(string infileused) {.        arraylist&lt;string&gt; templist = null;.        try {.            bufferedreader in = new bufferedreader(new filereader(infileused));.            try {.                string line;.                while ((line = in.readline()) != null) {.                    string[] s = line.split("" "");..                    for (int index=0;index&lt;line.length()-1; index++) {.                        system.out.println(""s: "" + s[index]);.                    }.                    //templist = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;(arrays.aslist(line.split("" "")));.                }.            } catch (ioexception e) {.                e.printstacktrace();.            }.        } catch (filenotfoundexception e) {.            e.printstacktrace();.        }.        return templist;.    }...file context that needs to be parsed..107458982                                                       ffm00000000000713432ch.107462291                                                       ffm00000000001835472t                              ..107462291                                                       ffm00000000002200570t                              ..107462291                                                       ffm00000000002432274t                              ..108018296                                                       ffm00000000001431509t                              ..108018296                                                       ffm00000000001553064t                              ..108122386                                                       ffm00000000001211063t                              ...108122386                                                       ffm00000000001862517t                              ...108491927                                                       ffm00000000004556330t                              ...108500569                                                       ffm00000000001682124                               ...108500569                                                       ffm00000000002023040                               ...108523927                                                       ffm00000000000611642                               ...108523927                                                       ffm00000000002162127                               ...108768840                                                       ffm00000000001360865t                              ...108768840                                                       ffm00000000001796191t                              ...108774203                                                       ffm00000000001821871t                              ...108774203                                                       ffm00000000001946211t                              ...108774203                                                       ffm00000000001914770t"
