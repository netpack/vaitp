"how to check ""if a flash drive is plugged in"" and copy the data thereby in blank i want to check by program if a flash drive (pen drive) is plugged into my computer. if i can detect that a flash drive is plugged in then all the contents will be copied to my computer invisibly. i've a idea to do that. but i think it's pretty bad...string alldrives[] = {""a"",""b"",....,""z""};.while(true){.   for(string drive : alldrives){.      if(drive exists){.          do the required task.      }   .   }.}...is there any better idea to do that? any help is appreciated."
