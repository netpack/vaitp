"keep running int errors while trying to ask my code to run a y/n while loop i am trying to run a while loop that ends with a y/n option to do it again. this is a calculator, i keep getting this error message error: cannot find symbol.  symbol:   variable scan.  location: class calculator.im trying to scan the next line for the letter y so the code knows to loop it or not but it seems to not be working, can someone help?..'''..import blank.util.scanner;.import static blank.lang.system.*;.public class calculator{  .public static void main(string[]args) {..//variables ..double num1;.double num2;.int y = 1;.double result=0;.int whichcalculation; .int start = 0; ..scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.. while (start == y)..//instructions.system.out.println(""choose a way to calculate. 1 to add  2 to subtract 3 to multiply 4 to divide."");..//take the users task.whichcalculation = input.nextint();..//get the numbers .system.out.println(""please enter the first number."");.num1 = input.nextdouble();.. system.out.println(""please enter the second number."");.num2 = input.nextdouble();.//calculation.if (whichcalculation == 1) {.  result = num1 + num2; .}.if (whichcalculation == 2) {.  result = num1 - num2;.}.if (whichcalculation == 3) {.  result = num1 * num2;.}.if (whichcalculation == 4) {.  result = num1 / num2;.}..//answer .system.out.println(""the answer is,,,"");.system.out.println(result);.. system.out.println(""do you want to continue y/n?"");.   start =scan.nextline();... }.}"
