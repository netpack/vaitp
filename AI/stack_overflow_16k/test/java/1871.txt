"integer.parseint() - signed and unsigned number from blankdoc, i understand that blank, by default, has int data type as a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of 2^31-1. ..if that is the case, why does this:..system.out.println(integer.parseint(""1111"", 2));...give a value of 15 instead of -1(2's complement signed number)."
