"running total instead of individual total? i'm required to develop a wages calculator application which calculates the total staff cost of a number of shop units per week and then prints the staff cost of each individual unit onto the screen. however, the program currently only prints a cumulative total for each unit onto the screen (ie. if the staff cost for unit one is £450 and the staff cost for unit two is £0 the program still prints the staff cost for unit two as £450 instead of £0). any ideas how i can change my code to fix this?..import blank.util.*;.import blank.io.*;..public class task3second {..static scanner console = new scanner(system.in);    ..public static void main(string[] args) throws filenotfoundexception .{.    scanner infile = new scanner(new filereader(""m:\4001comp-cw1-task3-infile.txt""));.    printwriter outfile = new printwriter(""results.txt"");..    string shopunit;.    int noofstaff;.    int hoursworkedperweek;.    double hourlyrate;.    double totalstaffcost = 0;.    int count = 0;.    double recommendedmaximumstaffcost;..    system.out.println(""please enter the recommended maximum staff cost."");.    recommendedmaximumstaffcost = console.nextdouble();.    system.out.println(""the recommended maximum staff cost is £"" + recommendedmaximumstaffcost);.    system.out.println();.    outfile.println(""the recommended maximum staff cost is £"" + recommendedmaximumstaffcost);..    while(infile.hasnext()){.        count++;.        shopunit = infile.nextline();.    if(shopunit.startswith(""unit"")){.        noofstaff = infile.nextint();.        for(count = 0; count &lt; noofstaff; count++){.            hoursworkedperweek = infile.nextint();.            hourlyrate = infile.nextdouble();.            totalstaffcost = totalstaffcost + (hoursworkedperweek * hourlyrate);.        }.        if (totalstaffcost &lt; recommendedmaximumstaffcost).        {system.out.println(""the total staff cost of "" + shopunit + "" is £"" + totalstaffcost + "", which is less than the recommended staff cost."");.        printwriter outfile1 = new printwriter(""results.txt"");.        outfile1.println(""the total staff cost of "" + shopunit + "" is £"" + totalstaffcost);.        }else if (totalstaffcost == recommendedmaximumstaffcost).        {system.out.println(""the total staff cost of "" + shopunit + "" is £"" + totalstaffcost + "", which is equal to the recommended staff cost."");  .        }else {system.out.println(""the total staff cost of "" + shopunit + "" is £"" + totalstaffcost + "", which is more than the recommended staff cost."");}..        }.    }..    system.out.println();.    system.out.println(""the total staff cost of all the shopping units is £"" + totalstaffcost);.    outfile.println(""the total staff cost of all the shopping units is £"" + totalstaffcost);..    infile.close();.    outfile.close();..}.}"
