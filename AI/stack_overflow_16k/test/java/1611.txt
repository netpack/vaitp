"resolve inetsocketaddress multiple times as far as i understand if a domain name is provided to inetsocketaddress then resolution will only happen once which breaks a scenario when i want to hide a dynamic ip address behind a domain name...is there are way to make inetsocketaddress resolve a domain name each time it's instantiated? is this a good way to solve a problem at all, perhaps some better practices exist?"
