"how to convert a 2d array to 1d array with the value as the index? i have a 2d array that gets dynamically created by any integer n. initially, i need to set all values in the array to a value that represents it being ""uninitialized"" where i use the number ""-1"". however, i want to convert this 2d array to a 1d array and assign every value to be equal to its index in the new 1d array. ..public class percolation {..private int[][] id;.private int[] array1d;.private int blocked = -1;   //a number that doesn't exist in the array..// create n-by-n grid, with all sites blocked.public percolation(int n){..    id = new int[n][n];.    for (int k = 0; k &lt; n; k++).    { for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) id[k][i] = blocked; } .}...// open site (row i, column j) if it is not already.public void open(int i, int j){...}...in the open method it should change the value at the given indexes to be the corresponding index in a 1d array. for example:...  [-1] [-1].  .  [-1] [-1]...would then become:...  [0] [1] [2] [3]...unfortunately, since this is homework i'm unsure how i can share the grid size ""n"" to be able to create a new 1d array with the indexes as the values."
