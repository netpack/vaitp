"find a specific word in an arraylist i am writing a code that loads an arraylist of strings and checks to see if a specific word is used. this may sound weird but the specifics are:..number of toots containing ""toot"" (with any capitalization and allowing zero (0) in place of oh (o), e.g., ""to0t"" should be counted too); however, you should not count a toot if it only contains ""toot"" as part of another work, e.g., ""tooter"" is not enough to count a toot...i have tried many things but it still doesn't seem to work and count the proper results...here is what i have now after some help from members:..for (string toot : toots) {.        toot = toot.tolowercase().replace(""0"", ""o"").trim();.        if(toot.equalsignorecase(""toot"")){.           tootswithtoot++;.        }.}...an example would be with the ""toot messages"" (each line is a separate message):..**1 toot 2 t00t..toot..will be back..tooter tooting**..the results should show 2 as tooter and tooting aren't the word ""toot"" with the o or 0 variations...i think a change should be that i need .contains but i'm not 100% sure..again, i apologize for this humorous request, i am still a novice programmer."
