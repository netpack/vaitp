"multiple if and then statements in the middle of each other (checkerboard using # and spaces) i am trying to create a checker board using spaces and the # key instead of the red and black squares. however i came across a problem with saying odd statements. i know how to say them.....for example:..if (num % 2 == 0) // this means the number is even..system.out.println()..else .system.out.println()..however, i do not know how to state multiple statements in one go. for the checkerboard i am using rows and num. i have already defined them and this is my current code ..public class checkerboard {..    public checkerboard() {.        // todo auto-generated constructor stub.    }..    public static void main(string[] args) .    {.        // todo auto-generated method stub.        // print board with 3 columns and 5 rows.        printcheckerboard(3,5);..        // print board with 4 columns and 3 rows.        printcheckerboard(4,3);..        // print board with 8 columns and 8 rows.        printcheckerboard(8,8);.    } .     public static void printcheckerboard(int numrows , int numcols) .    {.        // sample outer and inner for() loops.        // (assumes numrows and numcols are parameters.        // into the printcheckerboard() function)..        // for each row.        for (int row=0; row&lt;numrows; row++).        {..           // for each column in this row.           for (int col=0; col&lt;numcols; col++).           {.              // logic to print space or # goes here.               if (row % 2 == 0)   // if row is even.               {.                   if (col % 2 == 0)  //  and if column is even.                   {system.out.println (""#""); // print a hashtag..                   }.                   else ();.                   if (row % 2 == 0) // if row is even.                   {if (col % 2 == 0) // and if column is also even.                   {system.out.println("" ""); // print a space...                   }.               }       .               }.               }..        }..    }..}...i am trying to say .if the current row is even and column is odd, print a space.if the current row is odd and column is even, print a space.if the current row is odd  and column is odd, print ""#"".however i only know how to say if the row and column is even, print a #.please help me."
