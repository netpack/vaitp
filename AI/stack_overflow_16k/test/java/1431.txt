"do blank property changes stay beyond program-run? i'm currently trying to see how the threadcount affects matrix multiplication and have an implementation that is using blanks stream.parallel().foreach(), since it always starts with runtime.getruntime().availableprocessors() - 1 threads, i'm inclined to use..system.setproperty(""blank.util.concurrent.forkjoinpool.common.parallelism"", threadcount);...to change the amount of threads it uses. if i set the property to something other than default, will that property stay changed beyond the run of the program?"
