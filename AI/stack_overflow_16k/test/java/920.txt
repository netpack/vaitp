"what's the difference between this and super keywords in blank? check my coolmethod, babes:..package zoo;..public class zoo {..    public string coolmethod() {.        return ""wow baby!"";.    }..}...my moo class, that extends my zoo class, full of ways to do the same thing, which is calling my coolmethod...package zoo;..public class moo extends zoo {..    public void useazoo(){..        zoo z = new zoo();..        system.out.println(""a zoo says: ""+ z.coolmethod());.    }..    public void usemycoolmethod(){..        system.out.println(""my cool method says: "" + super.coolmethod());..    }..     public void usemycoolmethodagain(){..        system.out.println(""my cool method says: "" + this.coolmethod()+ "" (again)"");..    }..    public void inheritmymethod(){.        system.out.println(""my inhertied method says: "" + coolmethod());.    }..}...and my main, that calls my moo class functionalities...package blankcert1;..import zoo.moo;..public class main {...    public static void main(string[] args) {..        moo moo = new moo();..        moo.useazoo();..        moo.usemycoolmethod();..        moo.usemycoolmethodagain();..        moo.inheritmymethod();.    }..}...as you can see, all those four calls get the same results. i'm learning blank and i practiced with an example that used the ""this"" but i had seen the use of ""super"" elsewhere so i tested it and the results where the same. why is this? what's the major difference between a this and super keyword?"
