"blank creating a bufferedimage from a bytearray what i'm trying to do is create a bufferedimage from a byte array. here is what i'm doing now:..    try {.        bytearrayinputstream in = new bytearrayinputstream(bytearray);.        bufferedimage bimagefromconvert = imageio.read(in);..        color color = new color(bimagefromconvert.getrgb((int) local_car.x, (int) local_car.z));.        system.out.println(""r :: ""+color.getred() + "" b :: ""+color.getblue() + "" g :: ""+color.getgreen());.    } catch (ioexception e) {.        e.printstacktrace();.    }.}...the documentation of imageio.read says:...  returns a bufferedimage as the result of decoding a supplied url with an imagereader chosen automatically from among those currently registered. an inputstream is obtained from the url, which is wrapped in an imageinputstream. if no registered imagereader claims to be able to read the resulting stream, null is returned....i'm receiving a null pointer exception from imageio.read() returning null. i am sending my bytearray in the form of rgba. why is imageio.read returning null?"
