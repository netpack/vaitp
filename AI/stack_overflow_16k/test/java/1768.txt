"blank- working with an integer write a static method called digitsinarow that takes an integer n as a parameter and that returns the highest number of digits that appear in a row in the base-10 representation of n. for many numbers the answer will be 1 because they don't have adjacent digits that match. but for a number like 3555585, the answer is 4 because there are four occurrences of the digit 5 that appear in a row. you are not allowed to use a string to solve this problem. you may assume that the value passed to the method is greater than or equal to 0...public static int digitsinarow(int n) {.    if (n / 10 == 0) {.        return 1;.    }.    int count = 0;.    int count1 = 0;..    while (n &gt; 0) {.        int digit = n % 10;.        int a = n / 10;.        if (digit == a % 10) {.            count++;.        } else {.            count1 = math.max(count1, count);.            count = 0;.        }        .        n = n / 10;.    }.    return math.max(count, count1);.}...i know the if statement is messed up. i am trying to figure out a way to compare consecutive digits without using integer class or string class. any suggestions?"
