"need to clarify difference between element and index so my understanding is this.....string[] banks = {""b of a"", ""chase"", ""wells fargo""};...index: used as a reference to the actual place holder in the element's value of an array...index 0 is ""b of a""..index 1 is ""chase""..index 2 is ""wells fargo""..element: used to define how many values there are in an array (not including 0). in other words, index == element - 1 for example, this array has 3 elements:..element 1 is ""b of a""..element 2 is ""chase""..element 3 is ""wells fargo""..values: used to define what the actual variable type value is being held in the elements/indexes..the value of index 0 and element 1 is ""b of a""..the value of index 1 and element 2 is ""chase""..the value of index 2 and element 3 is ""wells fargo""..is this a correct interpretation? i want to make sure i'm learning this correctly.....my reason for asking, is to validate the question i got wrong on a test:"
