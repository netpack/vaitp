"blank using a variable value as an instance name so basically im reading a file , each line of this file contains description for from 3 to 5.instances of two types of objects with 2 to 4 being first type of object and last one being another type . the file can contain up to 500 lines . i am going to reuse each object from 1 .to unknown but on scale of hundrets of times and i need to track their status ...while i can all the data into an array and use only 5 objects changing their values constantly.that will make it rather hard to track status of each combination of their parameters ...what i want to is to create my instances with names such as fromline1obj1 , fromline10obj3 . ..i failed to mention the fact that each set of objects from a single line should also create a new thread and this set is proccesed in that thread ."
