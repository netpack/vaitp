"specifing path to class file from blank command line? i'm running a local script to automatically compile some .blank files and deploy the .class files to a remote server...on the remote server i can then issue this command from the directory i uploaded it too (i.e., /tmp) and it works fine......blank -cp .:/usr/share/blank/mysql-connector-blank.jar gpimport...but to execute it from my local script i need to specify the path of the .class file in /tmp so blank knows where to look for it...how do i do that? i thought it would've been really simple to figure out but i haven't had any luck so far!"
