blank way to count how many getters in bean that are not null ok i have a bean list and i can do beans.size() to get how many rows i got.....but i need to dynamically know how many columns of data i have before i send to the jsp...the maximum # of getters i have in the bean is 10......is there a way to do this??..would i have to do a loop on the list and do a if check on all the getters and increment?
