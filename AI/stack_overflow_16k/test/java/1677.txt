"how to move parts of an array to the front? so i had to use an array to add aliens into my program, and now i am supposed to move all the parts that are ""null"" to the front, so instead of printing out alien 1: blah blah, alien 2: null, alien 3: null, alien 4 blah blah, i need it to have alien 1 blah blah, alien 2 blah blah...i know how to do the remove feature in an array list, but am not sure how to figure this out with just a simple array...public void consolidate() {.    for (int index = 0; index &lt; cockpitcrew.length; index++) {.        if (cockpitcrew[index] == null) {..        }.    }.}...this is the code i have so far for the ""removal"" of the null array objects. ..edit: basically i need it to skip over the nulls when it prints out in this loop"
