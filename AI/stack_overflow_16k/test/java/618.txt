"transfer the system.out to another class and read from it i am working on a selfmade console (api, with gui) and wanted to transfer the output from a program a, using my console, to my console class b, then read a string from it (the output from program a)...all answers i found were about creating a new printstream around a bytearrayoutputstream etc...the reason why i want to do this, is because i want to keep the code as easy as possible for others (best solution: one method to call in the program,)...it would be great if something like this would be possible for the programmer using my api:..consoleapi c = new consoleapi();.c.setoutput(system.out);.system.out.println(""hello world!"");...i don't think, this is possible, but maybe it is. :)..thanks in advance!"
