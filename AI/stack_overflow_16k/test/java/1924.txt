"how to estimate elevation based on sample set of elevations for other coordinates given a set of (x, y, z) points in 3d space, i want to be able to estimate the z for a new (x, y) pair...for example: i am given a height map of a geographical feature, for example some hills in the countryside. that means that for some latitudes and longitudes, i know the elevation of the ground at that point. i would like to estimate the elevation of a person standing at (latitude, longitude) that is most likely not in the sample set...how can i do that in blank?..i have already researched splines but am struggling to make any progress that way, and i also just tried using graphhopper's elevationinterpolator but it gives clearly wrong results â€” it doesn't seem to give accurate estimations at all, unless the provided (lat, long) are in the sample set, then it is correct, but if it's just slightly offset it gives a wildly different elevation, and it gives the same elevation for all positions that aren't in the sample set."
