"blank not recognising calculation? i am a beginner with blank and losing the plot.  could someone help me, i am simply trying to get this code to work.  everything runs fine except the calculations at the end. i have copied and pasted code and output. ..import blank.util.scanner;.public class newfile {.public static void main(string[]args) { // starting point of the program.    scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.    int onea, oneb, onec;.    double fina=0, finb=0, finc=0,average=0;..    system.out.println(""hello, welcome to the 'calculate your grades' program!nplease input your predicted grade for assignment 1a in a percentage format:"");.    onea=input.nextint();.    system.out.println(""thank you, can you please input your predictive grade for assignment 1b?"");.    oneb=input.nextint();.    system.out.println(""finally, can you please input your predictive grade for assignment 1c?"");.    onec=input.nextint();.    average=(onea+oneb+onec)/3;.    system.out.println(""excellent, thank you. the program has calculated your average grade to be ""+average+""%"");.    fina=(onea/100)*25;.    finb=(oneb/100)*25;.    finc=(onec/100)*50;.    system.out.println(""this module states:n assignment 1a is weighted at 25%. you achieved ""+fina+""%n assignment 1b is weighted at 25%. you achieved ""+finb+""%n assignment 1c is weighted at 50%. you achieved ""+finc+""%"");.    }       .}...output:..--------------------configuration: newfile - jdk version 1.7.0_45 &lt;default&gt; - &lt;default&gt;--------------------..hello, welcome to the 'calculate your grades' program!.please input your predicted grade for assignment 1a in a percentage format:.60.thank you, can you please input your predictive grade for assignment 1b?.60.finally, can you please input your predictive grade for assignment 1c?.60.excellent, thank you. the program has calculated your average grade to be 60.0%.this module states:.assignment 1a is weighted at 25%. you achieved 0.0%.assignment 1b is weighted at 25%. you achieved 0.0%.assignment 1c is weighted at 50%. you achieved 0.0%...process completed...the build report is clear."
