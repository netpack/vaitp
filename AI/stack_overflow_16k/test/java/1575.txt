"combining numbers into one blank variable i am trying to make a program that, depending on an int called length, adds a certain number of 9s to a variable called nines. for example, if length is 4 then i want nines to equal 9999. if length is 7, i want nines to equal 9999999. the value of length needs to correspond to the number of nines in nines. is this possible, and if so, how?"
