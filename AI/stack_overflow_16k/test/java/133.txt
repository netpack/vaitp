"breaking down composite arithmetic expressions in a blank string given a string like..a + b * c / (d + e)...the algorithm will break the string down into a list of binary operations:...add d and e (result #1).multiply b and c (result #2).divide result #1 by result #2 (result #3).add result #3 to a...basically, the order in which a programming language like blank would execute the expression...what is the best approach for this sort of problem?"
