final keyword in for statement i was reading some code found on the web and fell on these lines (blank):..private list&lt;string&gt; values;..[...]..for (final string str : values) {.   length += context.strlen(str);.}...what is the advantage of declaring a variable final in a for loop ? i thought the variable specified in the for loop was already read-only (e.g. can't assign something to 'str' in the above example). ..thx
