"blank double calculation problems i'm currently working on a trafficsimulation which is based on a grid system. for some reason the line of code, which calculates how many tiles i have to add always returns 0. i have tried it without the variables but it still doesn't work...double blockstoadd = o.getvelocity()*((1000/main.fps)/1000);...currently the velocity is equal to 1.0f and the simulation runs at 10 fps, so blockstoadd should be 0.1, but it always returns 0."
