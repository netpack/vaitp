"variables that are used for output data (in this case account balance) aren't changing when i call methods to alter them so, for an assignment that i have, i have to create a program that will figure out when two people (john/mary) will be able to pay back a loan that they took out and then display back how long it took them in months as well as how much they have saved over time. the program consists of 4 classes, (application, savingsaccount(marys account), currentaccount(johns account) and loanaccount). i have numerous methods set to do things such as add an interest rate onto the account balance every month. problem is it works out when the loan will be paid back, but not how much they have saved in their savings/current account while doing so. the two variables that store this information (one set to 100.0 by default, the other set to 0.0) haven't changed in value when i try to print the account value at the end. though it will print out the loanaccount value for each month if i want it to, which leaves me clueless to what i have done wrong...code below:..application:..  package assignment2;../**. *. * @author josh. */.public class application {.    static private int monthjohn = 0;.    static private int monthmary = 0;.    static private float totaldebt = 20000.00f;.    static private boolean johnfinished = false;.    static private boolean maryfinished = false;.    static private float johntotalsaved = 0.00f;.    static private float marytotalsaved = 0.00f;.    public static void main (string args[]){..        john();.        mary();.        if (johnfinished == true &amp;&amp; maryfinished == true){.            currentaccount amountj = new currentaccount();.            float savingsj = amountj.getbalancejohn();.            savingsaccount amountm = new savingsaccount();.            float savingsm = amountm.getbalancesamary();.            system.out.println(""john repaid his loan after "" + monthjohn + "" months. his current account balance at that time was £"" + savingsj);.            system.out.println(""mary repaid her loan after "" + monthmary + "" months. her savings account balance at that time was £"" + savingsm);.        }...        //test for interest rate in ca..    }.    public static void mary(){.        loanaccount debt = new loanaccount();.        float debtpaid = debt.getbalancelamary();.        while(debtpaid &lt;= totaldebt){.            savingsaccount mary = new savingsaccount();.            mary.addinterestmary();.            mary.utilitiesmary();.            mary.monthlypaymary();.            debt.addinterestmary();.            debt.takeloanpaymentmary();.            debtpaid = debt.getbalancelamary();.            monthmary++;.            //system.out.println(""test: "" + debtpaid + "" month: "" + monthjohn);..        }.        maryfinished = true;..    }.    public static void john(){.        float test = 0.0f;.        loanaccount debt = new loanaccount();.        float debtpaid = debt.getbalancelajohn();.        while(debtpaid &lt;= totaldebt){.            currentaccount john = new currentaccount();.            john.addinterestjohn();.            john.utilitiesjohn();.            john.monthlypayjohn();.            debt.addinterestjohn();.            debt.takeloanpaymentjohn();.            john.getbalancejohn();.            test = john.getbalancejohn();.            debtpaid = debt.getbalancelajohn();.            monthjohn++;.            //system.out.println(""test: "" + debtpaid + "" month: "" + monthjohn + "" test :"" + test);..        }.        johnfinished = true;..        }.}...currentaccount:..  package assignment2;../**. *. * @author josh. */.public class currentaccount {.    //variable declaration.    private float balance = 0.00f;.    private float interestrate = 0.0008f;.    private float interest = 0.0f;.    private float loanpayment = 200.00f;.    private float monthlywage = 2000.00f;.    private float utilitiesjohn = 1200.00f;..    public static void main (string args[]){...    }..   public float getbalancejohn(){.       return balance;.   }.   public void addinterestjohn(){.       interest = interestrate * balance;.       balance = balance + interest;..   }.    public void monthlypayjohn(){.       balance = balance + monthlywage;..   }.   public float makedepositjohn(){.       balance = balance -
