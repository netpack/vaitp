"create a single random value to share across classes blank final(?) edit:.leonardo pina's solution looks like what i needed. thank you all for your input! my code is now:..public final class roll {.    private static final random r1 = new random();.    private final int r = level();..    private static final int level() {.        int s = 1, e = 100;.        int r = r1.nextint((e - s) + 1) + s;.        return r;.    }..    public int itemtype() {.        boolean b = r1.nextboolean();.        int a = ((b) ? 1 : 2);.        return a;.    }..    public int getr() {.        return r;.    }..}...and the implementation in the other class:..public class damage {.    roll r;..    damage(roll r) {.        this.r = r;.    }..    public int damageout() {.        int a = r.getr();   //roll value.        return a * 2;   //test math on r.    }.}...edit:.thank you for the responses. however, it seems my use of this method was not clear. apologies! this is what i need:..call roll class, get e.g. ""12"".otherclass1 receives ""12"" from roll via getter.otherclass2 also receives ""12"" from roll via getter.call roll class again, get a new random number, e.g. ""48"".otherclass1 receives ""48"" from roll via getter.otherclass2 also receives ""48"" from roll via getter..using the solutions provided, roll creates a single random number and never creates a new one again. i need roll to create random numbers on demand, and then share that random number with other classes. i do not want it to only generate one number and then stop. i hope this makes sense. thank you for the responses so far!....i have searched for and read the other threads of a similar topic (including this one, which is how i tried to solve my problem), but the methods i have tried have failed. i need to create a single random value and then use that same value across multiple classes...my random class:..public final class roll {.    private static final random r1 = new random();.    private final int r = level();..    private static final int level() {.        int s = 1, e = 100;.        int r = r1.nextint((e - s) + 1) + s;.        return r;.    }..    public int itemtype() {.        boolean b = r1.nextboolean();.        int a = ((b) ? 1 : 2);.        return a;.    }..    public int getr() {.        return r;.    }..}...and a class where i call for the static value from the random class:..public class otherclass{.    roll roll = new roll();.    int r = roll.getr();..    public int getr() {.        return r;.    }.}...when i call the getter from otherclass, the value is different than the getter from roll. i would expect them to be the same value...i call the values for testing like so:..roll roll = new roll();.int r = roll.getr();.otherclass other = new otherclass();.int o = other.getr();...any guidance would be greatly appreciated. have a good day."
