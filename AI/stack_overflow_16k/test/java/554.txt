"how to end a while loop my program for class asks to run the program as long as the user doesn't enter the input of -99. when i run the program and enter a usable number that isn't -99, the console will run a continuous looping answer until i have to press end. .how can i change the program so for each input there will be one answer and the program restarts until user inputs -99?..import blank.util.scanner; //import scanner .import blank.io.*; //import library ..public class is_odd_or_even_number {//begin class..   public static void main(string []args) {//begin main..      scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..      //use try/catch method to test for invalid input.      try{.      //promt user to input a value .      system.out.print(""enter a positive integer value: "");.      int number = input.nextint();..      //part i need help with **************.      while (number != -99){.      //start of if statement to test which to print and call of iseven method.         if (iseven(number)) {.         system.out.println(""your number is even!"");  .         }.         else .         system.out.println(""your number is odd!"");..         }.      }.      //open catch method and print invalid .      catch(exception notnumber) {.         system.out.println(""input not a number, try again."");.      }.   }.   //begin testing for odd or even in new method .   public static boolean iseven(int num){.         return(num &amp; 1) == 0;.      }.}"
