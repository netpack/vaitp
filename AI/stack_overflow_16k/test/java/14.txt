"blank - trimming trailing whitespace from a byte array i have byte arrays similar to this:..[77, 83, 65, 80, 79, 67, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32]...roughly equal to..[m , s, a, p, o, c,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ] when printed as chars....now i want to trim the trailing whitespace so it looks like:..[77, 83, 65, 80, 79, 67]...easiest way to do this?..edit: i don't want to deal with strings because there is the possibility for non-printable bytes, and i can not afford to lose that data. it needs to be byte arrays :( whenever i do convert to strings, bytes like 01 (soh) 02 (stx) etc are lost. ..edit 2: just to clarify. do i lose data if i convert byte arrays to strings? now a little confused. what about if the bytes are of a different character set?"
