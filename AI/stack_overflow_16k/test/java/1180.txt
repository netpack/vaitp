"how to pad a formatted string this may seem as a simple problem, but i honestly didn't seem to work this out..i have a formatted string as follows:..string msg = string.format(""current player: %1$s"", status.getcurrentplayer().getname());...and i want to left-pad it, lets say with 10 spaces. i tried:..string pad = string.format(""%1$10s"", msg);...but it doesn't seem to work, although i tried it with an unformatted string: ..string pad = string.format(""%1$10s"", ""some string"");...and obviousely, it worked..what is it about ""msg"" that does not let me pad it?"
