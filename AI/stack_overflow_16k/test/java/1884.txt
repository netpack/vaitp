"blank - how do i pass the return type of a method as parameter? i'm trying to make a small game with a tui. the tui should have a get() method that should take a string question and a return type as parameter, so you can use it to request an object...for example, get(""what is your name?"", string) should return a string and get(""what color do you want?"", color) should return a color. ..this is what i've come up with:..public interface view {..    public &lt;t&gt; t get(string question, class&lt;t&gt; type) throws inputexception;..}..public class tui implements view {..    public color get(string question, class&lt;color&gt; type) {.        // code.    }..    public string get(string question, class&lt;string&gt; type) {.        // code.    }..}..color color = game.getview().get(""what piece do you want to place?"", color.class);...unfortunately, the methods in tui are not accepted as implementations of public &lt;t&gt; t get(string question, class&lt;t&gt; type) throws inputexception;. is there any way i can do this?"
