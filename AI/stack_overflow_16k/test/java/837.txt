"blank - calculating total with cost and unknown number of items i have a task here: define a class payperview with method moviefee() that calculates the monthly charges for movies rented. the method should take one argument representing number of movies rented and return the fee as a double. ..the rental fee fee is $6.99 per movie.  preferred customers that rent more than 10 per month get a discount of 5%.  ..here's my code so far:..public class payperview {..public static void main(string [] args){...}.public static double moviefee(int n){..    double fee = 6.99;.    double total= n*fee;..    system.out.println(""your balance due this month is"" + total);   ..    //return 6.99*n * ((n&gt;10) ? 0.95:1);..}}...i know it's awful, i'm sorry and you can ignore that last line of code i commented out because i'm going to redo it and turn it into an if statement. i thought maybe i should use an array, but i can't right? because i don't know how many movies are/will be rented? should i use an arraylist for the number of movies rented?"
