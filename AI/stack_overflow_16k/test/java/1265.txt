"blank file error: could not find or load main class i'm having troubles loading my program into a linux server. i was able to copy paste my code from my ide i'm using and have the server compile and run the code, with execution being empty. i changed the lines println to printf and the file will not compile and gives me the error, ""could not find or load main class program01"" every time. including when i paste my old code that just worked, everything i'm trying is failing. looking for other opinions on what i can fix. it pulls from an input file with the number ""312032486"". just wondering why it is not able to find or load the main class. i believe everything else is working as intended...thanks to all who take a look and open to any device as i'm new to blank.../*.* to change this license header, choose license headers in project properties..* to change this template file, choose tools | templates.* and open the template in the editor..*/.package program01;..import blank.util.scanner;../**.*.* @author devin.*/.public class program01 {../**. * @param args the command line arguments. */.public static void main(string[] args) {.    // todo code application logic here.    // create variables for birth rate, death rate and immigration raet.    int birthrate = 1 / 7;.    int deathrate = 1 / 13;.    int immigrationrate = 1 / 45;..    // variable creating the number of seconds per year.    int secondsperyear = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;..    // variable to find births, deaths and immigrants added per year.    int birthsperyear = birthrate * secondsperyear;.    int deathsperyear = deathrate * secondsperyear;.    int immigrantsperyear = immigrationrate * secondsperyear;..    // scanner method to get population through input.data.    scanner sc = new scanner (system.in);.    system.out.printf(""enter population: "");.    int population = sc.nextint();.    system.out.printf(""population is: "" + population);..    // math to create variables for population per x year.    double populationyear0 = population;.    double populationyear1 = populationyear0 + birthsperyear - deathsperyear + immigrantsperyear;.    double populationyear2 = populationyear1 + birthsperyear - deathsperyear + immigrantsperyear;.    double populationyear3 = populationyear2 + birthsperyear - deathsperyear + immigrantsperyear;.    double populationyear4 = populationyear3 + birthsperyear - deathsperyear + immigrantsperyear;.    double populationyear5 = populationyear4 + birthsperyear - deathsperyear + immigrantsperyear;..    // print out the variables data from code above.    system.out.println(""population year 0: "" + populationyear0);.    system.out.println(""population year 1: "" + populationyear1);.    system.out.println(""population year 2: "" + populationyear2);.    system.out.println(""population year 3: "" + populationyear3);.    system.out.println(""population year 4: "" + populationyear4);.    system.out.println(""population year 5: "" + populationyear5);..}..}"
