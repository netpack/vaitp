"what is returning class when use ""return this""? i started learning blank and i couldn't understand one of examples in ""thinking in blank"" book..in this example author represent, as he state ""simple use of 'this' keyword"":..//leaf.blank.//simple use of the ""this"" keyword..public class leaf {.    int i = 0;.    leaf increment() {.        i++;.        return this;.    }.    void print() {.        system.out.println(""i = "" + i);.    }.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        leaf x = new leaf();.        x.increment().increment().increment().print();.    }.}...and when above code is working as indeed, i cant understand what increment() method is returning. ..it's not variable i, it's not object x? i just don't get it. i tried to modify program to understand it (like replace return this with return i or print x instead of i), but compiler shows me errors."
