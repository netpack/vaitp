"why local inner class cannot access non-final local variables? (blank 1.7) but when a method ends, the scope of local inner class ends. we can not access the inner class object once the .method is over. ..i know when a method ends the local variables get lost from the stack but also when a method ends we cannot access the inner class object( i.e in the heap).then why it still needs to have access to local variables."
