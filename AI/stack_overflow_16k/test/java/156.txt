"do i need to specify indirectly imported package when compiling and running? if a .blank file imports  a package a which in turn imports another package b, ...when i compile the .blank file to get its .class file using blankc in command line, do i need to specify after -cp the path to b.class as well as the path to a.class?.when i run the .class file using blank in command line, do i need to specify after -cp the path to b.class as well as the path to a.class?...from an example of junit test, compiling the test doesn't require specifying  hamcrest to blankc -cp, while running the test does. is the answer to the first question about compiling ""no"", and the answer to the second question about running ""yes""?..thanks."
