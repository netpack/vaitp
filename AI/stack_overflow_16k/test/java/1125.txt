"decisions without if statements here are the instructions:../*. * write a method called isgameover. the method should have three parameters, . * all integers and in this order: the player's score, the number of lives . * the player has remaining, the game level. the method should return true . * if the game is over and false otherwise, according to the following game. * rule. the game continues only when the player has at least one life . * remaining and one of these conditions is met: . *   --the player is on level 1 and his/her score at least 1000. . *   --the player is on level 2 and his/her score at least 2000. . *   --the player is on any level and his/her score at least 3000. . *   . * for example, the method call isgameover(1500, 1, 2) should return true. . * . * do not use an if statement...and here is my code:..public static string isgameover(int score, int lives, int level) {..    while (level == 1 &amp;&amp; level &lt; 1001).        return ""false"";..    while (level == 2 &amp;&amp; level &lt; 2001).        return ""false"";..     while (level == 3 &amp;&amp; level &lt; 3001).        return ""false"";..    return ""true"";          .}...it's obviously not working, and i just have this feeling it's because i used a while loop. how can i make a decision without using an if statement?"
