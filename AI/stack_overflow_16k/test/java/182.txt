"issues with scanner preventing system.out from printing i'm getting an error where i'm trying to take input as a string, but whenever i use scanner's nextline feature, it causes the next line - or several lines - of system.out.print or println not to show up at all until  about 3 random strings. i'm working on a homework assignment for my computer science class that's really strict about cheating, so for simplicity's sake i'm going to upload a completely irrelevant yet similar example that demonstrates my issue...import blank.util.scanner;..public class test {.    static scanner reader = new scanner(system.in);.    public static void main(string[] args).    {.        string floor = reader.nextline();..        if(floor.equals(""f"")){.            string floorname = """";.            system.out.print(""enter floorname:"");.            floorname = reader.nextline();.        }.    }.}...i'm also using intellij idea as an ide and gradle for the compiler, i'm not quite sure if that'd be something that'd affect this but i figured it's relevant information...for reference, this outputs:..f (user inputs f)..f (user inputs whatever)..enter floorname: (this pops in late)"
