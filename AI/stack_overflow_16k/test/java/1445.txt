"why does my program skip commands?     system.out.print(""what is the first number? "");.    x=user.nextint();.    system.out.println();.    system.out.print(""what is the second number? "");.    y=user.nextint();.   system.out.println();..    system.out.print(""answer yes/no. would you like to multiply? "");.    ans=user.nextline();.    system.out.println();.    if(ans.equals(""yes"")||ans.equals(""y"")).    {.        system.out.println(x*y);.    }.    else {.        system.out.println(""how about division? "");.        ans=user.nextline();.        system.out.println();...===============..this is the output..what is the first number? 6..what is the second number? 5..answer yes/no. would you like to multiply? how about division? ..========.why does it not wait to take user input after the mulitplication question?"
