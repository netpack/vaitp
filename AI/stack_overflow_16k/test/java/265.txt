"blank heap outofmemoryerror i am creating a streaming application and when i stream to my client, the client throws an outofmemoryerror. my heap is only 6mb big, and i have increased the maximum heap size to 1gb. is it possible that when i am filling the cache, it fills too fast (for gc?)? or what could be the problem? any ideas?..it crashes here (on the first line to be exact):..byte[] songdata = new byte[length];.bytebuffer databuffer = bytebuffer.wrap(packet.getdata(), songdatagram.header_size, length);.databuffer.get(songdata);.datapacket datapacket = new datapacket(songdata);.putintocache(datapacket);...this code gets executed a couple thousand times, because i split the song into packets of around 1kb and fill a treeset (the cache) with these packets ordered by a sequencenr...i am analyzing a dump on ema, but as i said the heap is only 6 mb (and i understand, even with a memoryleak it would crash when i surpass the maximum heap size at 1 gb)...the error..exception in thread ""thread-5"" blank.lang.outofmemoryerror: blank heap space.at utils.networking.songdatagrambuilder.converttosongdatagram(songdatagrambuilder.blank:108).at controllers.networking.streaming.musicstreamingservice.listen(musicstreamingservice.blank:142).at controllers.networking.streaming.musicstreamingservice$$lambda$59/369920468.run(unknown source).at blank.lang.thread.run(thread.blank:745)space"
