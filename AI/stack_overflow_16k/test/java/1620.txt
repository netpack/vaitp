"when is the memory allocated for local variables in functions? i know that memory allocated for functions and static members is done only once, and that class variables are given new memory space each time a new object is created...once i use the new operator in this following problem, i will get 8 bytes for the class variables.  but, when is memory for int c allocated?  during compile time?..class a.{.    int a,b;..    void show().    {.        int c;.    }..    public static void main(string...s).    {.        new a().show();.    }.}"
