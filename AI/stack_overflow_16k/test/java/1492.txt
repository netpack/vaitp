"determining missing data i have text file.  it contains delimited data in each line like, ..120 us 1 alaska 4....in some lines some data are missing. like, ..us 1 alaska 4...since it is delimited by space, i am using split to get the tokens.  i am not able to determine which data is missing...in the below code, sample input1 will validate 120 for ^[1-9]+$. if the 120 is missing in the line, as in sample input2, the token[0] will have us, it will validate for ^[1-9]+$ and give ""error in a"".  instead of this, i want to know which value is missing.  so, that i can display the error ""error a i missing"" and the token[1] should contain us, so that i can validate correctly...can someone give some idea for doing the above?   ..        string line = ""120 us 1 alaska 4""; //sample input1.       //string line = ""us 1 alaska 4""; //sample input2.        string delimiter = ""[ ]+"";.        string tokens[] = line.split(delimiter);..        string a = tokens[0];.        string b = tokens[1];.        string c = tokens[2];.        string d = tokens[3];.        string e = tokens[4];..        //sample validation.        if(a.matches(""^[1-9]+$"")){.           system.out.println(""matches"");.        }else{.           system.out.println(""error in a"");.        }"
