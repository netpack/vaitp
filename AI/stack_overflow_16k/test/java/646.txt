"why is this throwing a blank.util.inputmismatchexception? here is my code:..    public static void readfile() throws filenotfoundexception {.        scanner scan = new scanner(file);.        scan.usedelimiter(""/|\."");.        scan.nextline();..        grocerielist.foodlist.add(scan.next());.        grocerielist.foodamount.add(scan.nextint());..        system.out.println(grocerielist.foodlist);  // this is for testing.        system.out.println(grocerielist.foodamount); // also for testing.    }...this is the code for foodamount:..static arraylist&lt;integer&gt; foodamount = new arraylist&lt;&gt;();...the file that holds holds my input is a simple .txt and the input looks like this:..eggs.bread..3.6....now there shouldn't be a mismatch in my mind because grocerielist.foodamount.add(scan.nextint()); clearly picks up two integers?!"
