"disable class certificates information checking (blank) i created a library that loads a jar directly into the current classpath to launch one of its class..but the injected jar contains certificates, so i got this error :..blank.lang.securityexception: class ""testclass"" signer information does not match signer information of other classes in the same package..this is normal, but i can't get rid of it. it is normal, because two differents jar are ""colliding"", but, i can't delete the certificate of the jar because it's a third-party one...so, can i disable the class cert checking ? or do something to get rid of that error ?.i think i need to overwrite the classloader.checkcerts method... but it's dirty.....thanks for those who will answer to me, and sorry for bad english (i am young and french)"
