"parsing http response by specific word in blank? got an http response i need to parse, more precisely i wanna get a part of the response based on a tag. let's say:..&lt;div class=""row""&gt;&lt;span&gt;some text&lt;pre&gt;% copyright (c) &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;...so i'd pass ""pre"" and the parser would return the block between ..&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;. ...is there a better way to do this in blank?.i don't understand if httpmessageparser could do it for me...thanks in advance!"
