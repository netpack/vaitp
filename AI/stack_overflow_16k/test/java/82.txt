"how to allow user's input even if you don't know how many will input i am now going to make a program that can allow user's to enter their id number..but i don't know how to do because i don't know how many id number user's will input..for example:.if i know user's wanna put 2 person's id number, so my code will be like this:         ..//get 2 people's student id.          system.out.print(""enter the first people's student id: "");.          string id1 = input.next();.          system.out.print(""enter the second people's student id: "");.          string id2 = input.next();...if i know user's wanna put 3 person's id number, so my code will be like this:..//get 3 people's student id.              system.out.print(""enter the first people's student id: "");.              string id1 = input.next();.              system.out.print(""enter the second people's student id: "");.              string id2 = input.next();.              system.out.print(""enter the third people's student id: "");.              string id3 = input.next();...but this is the case that i know how many number that user will enter.  if i don't know how many number will they enter, what can i do to allow user's input and store the number they enter?"
