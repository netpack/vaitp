"compiling with oracle blankc vs openjdk blankc our software previously shipped with the openjdk jre, but now we are going to ship the oracle jre...previously we compiled with the openjdk blankc compiler. i assume now we should use the oracle blankc compiler as it is more likely to generate problem free code when run with the oracle jre. is this correct?..if so how can the blankc vendor be verified? i would want the makefile to error out if using the wrong compiler (our old software version would use the openjdk compiler, while the new version would use oracle compiler)."
