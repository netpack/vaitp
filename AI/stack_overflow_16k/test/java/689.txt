"copying portion of object array in blank if i have an object array in blank car[] a = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. how would i make a copy of this array from index 2 to 7? ..i thought about making a for loop..car[] b = new car[a.length - 2];..for (int i = 2; i &lt; a.length; i++) {.  b[i - 2] = a[i];.}...is there another way by using some of blank's built in library? if there is, would it be more or less efficient than the for loop i proposed?"
