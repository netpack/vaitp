"faster way to refactoring code bg:now i want to divide project a into project b and project c...for project b, there must be some classes like this..public class example{.   public void methodforprojectb(){.   ///   .   }..   public void methodforprojectc(){.   ///.   }..}...so as i want to delete methodforprojectc() in projectb, it cost me a lot of times to know if a method is called, is there any faster way?..also, if i can know the dependcy of every class clearly, then it would be easier to know. which class is not needed anymore."
