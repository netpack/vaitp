"null-pointer in recursively search function after return i have a class that uses an internal binary tree as a data structure. i have a weird problem. i'm recursively looking for a specific node. if the node is found i want the code to return the reference to it. the problem: after return it's always null! but why?..private heapnode getheapnode(double key) {.    //element is not available here, null-pointer, always.    return getheapnoderec(key, rootheapnode);.}..private heapnode getheapnoderec(double key, heapnode curr) {.    if (curr == null) {.        return null;.    }.    if (curr.getkey() == key) {.        //element is available here, i can access its data!.        return curr;.    }.    else {.        getheapnoderec(key, curr.getleft());.        getheapnoderec(key, curr.getright());.    }.    return null;.}"
