"how can i call a method that requires graphics g when i can't instantiate a graphics object since it as abstract? i need to find the size of the font for spacing purposes and found this helpful: https://docs.oracle.com/blankse/tutorial/2d/text/measuringtext.html..however, i'm not sure how i can make this work out correctly. ..public dimension getfontsize(graphics g, jlabel l){.   graphics2d g2 = (graphics2d)g;..   fontmetrics metrics = g2.getfontmetrics(titlefont);..   return new dimension(metrics.stringwidth(l.gettext()), metrics.getheight());...i think i may have to take an alternate approach here but i'm not sure how to do that as i'm not clear on how exactly graphics works. any insight would be greatly appreciated."
