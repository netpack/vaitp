"what's wrong with the logic on this program? i have an issue with this fragment of code. it's part of a program that calculates what you would call npr on some calculators. it compiles with no error but each time i run it and set n = 0 i get a seemingly endless list of error messages. why can't it just print out ""error!"" and terminate the program like i programmed it to?..{.    system.out.print(""n = "");.    int n = j.nextint();.    system.out.print(""r = "");.    int r = j.nextint();.    long n_fact = factorial(n);.    if ( ( (n - r) &lt;= 0 ) || (n &lt;= 0) || (r &lt; 0) ).    {.        system.out.println(""error!"");.        system.exit(0);.    }.    else.    {.        long nr_fact = factorial(n - r);.        long npr = n_fact / nr_fact;.        numberformat f = numberformat.getnumberinstance();.        system.out.println(""npr = "" + f.format(npr));.    }.}"
