how to check whether a blankprocess is still running or not? i am working on a plugin for the serversoftware bukkit which should restart it. so i have added the main function which checks for the right arguments and then starts bukkit. but before it starts bukkit it should wait for bukkit to shutdown before i start it again. i know i could add a timeout but i hope there is a better way. so does anybody know how to do that?
