"blank: trouble calling another class i am just beginning in blank and i am having a peculiar problem that i just cant seem to get to the root of. i have 2 programs and one is taking data from a text file and then calling it into a class to do some calculations and finally putting the output into another text document...everything works except this part here:..public class paycheck.{.//constants for the private class.private final string employee_name;           //employee name          .private final string soc_sec_num;             //employee social security number.private final double wage_rate;               //employee wage.private final double tax_rate;                //employee tax withheld .private final double hours_worked;            //employee's hours of work..//variables for the private class.private double grosspay;                      //employee gross pay.private double taxwithheld;                   //employee tax withheld.private double netpay;                        //employee net pay......//this is the constructor. it is called whenever an instance of the class is created.public paycheck (string name, string ssn, double wage, double tax, double hours).{.    employee_name = name;  //instance employee name.    soc_sec_num = ssn;    //instance employee ssn.    wage_rate = wage;      //instance employee wage rate.    tax_rate = tax;        //instance employee tax rate.    hours_worked = hours;  //instance employee hours worked.}..//this calculates the variables in the paycheck class.public void calcwages().{.    grosspay = wage_rate * hours_worked;    //calculates gross pay.    taxwithheld = grosspay * tax_rate;      //calculates taxes withheld.    netpay = grosspay - taxwithheld;        //calculates net pay..}.....//returns the paycheck objects employee name.public string getemployeename().{.    return employee_name;.}..//returns the employee ssn of the paycheck object.public string getsocsecnum().{.    return soc_sec_num;.}..//reeturns a paycheck object's employee wage rate.public double getwagerate().{.    return wage_rate;.}..//returns a paycheck object's employee tax rate.public double gettaxrate().{.    return tax_rate;.}..//returns an paycheck object's employee hours worked.public double gethoursworked().{.    return hours_worked;.}..//returns a paycheck object's gross pay.public double getgrosspay().{.    return grosspay;.}..//returns a paycheck object's taxes withheld.public double gettaxwithheld().{.    return taxwithheld;.}..//returns a paycheck object't net pay .public double getnetpay().{.    return netpay;.}...the calcwages() does the necessary calculations and below this are a series of get statements to call them. however, my output does not return any values for the calcwages() arguments...i added the getters here and my other program is grabbing them. however the final output on my other program is coming up as 0...where am i going wrong here?..this is the part of the main method that is calling them..  public static void main(string [] args) throws ioexception //throws clause.{.    //declare constants.    final string input_file = ""employee.txt"";         //input text file containing employee information.    final string output_file= ""payrollhistory.txt"";   //output text file that will receive the data..    //declare variables.    string payperioddate;       //ending date of the pay period.    string employeename;        //employee name in text file.    string employeesocsecnum;   //employee ssn in text file.    double employeehours;       //employee hours worked.    double employeetax;         //employee tax rate .    double employeewage;        //employee wage rate.    double totalgrosspay;       //total employee gross for pay period.    double totaltaxwithheld;    //total tax withheld for pay period.    double totalnetpay;         //total net payroll for pay period.    string input;               //string input for double conversion in joptionpane..    decimalformat money = new decimalformat (""#0.00""); // decimal format to put money in the right format(usd)..    //this ensures that the input file actually exists in the program folder .    //and exits the program if it does not, along with the prompt..    file file = new file(input_file);.  if (!file.exists()).  {.     joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null, ""the "" + input_file + "" file cannot be found."" +.
