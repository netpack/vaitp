"why to use separate string constants file? given the way string pool works for a given piece of code why is it preferred to create a separate file for storing the constants?..string str = ""test"";...suppose, the string ""test"" is used over 50 times in the entire application. why is recommended to store this in a constants file. now ,the way string pool works should actually create only one object if it doesn't exist in the pool and then share the references of this object to other places as and when needed. then why to create a separate constant file to store constants?"
