"call function passed as an argument with arguments i have a function, which takes a function and string as arguments, i want to call this function with the string argument and return the result...something like this:..public static string mainfunc(callable func, string s) {.    return func.call(s); // error.}..mainfunc(someobject::instancemethod, s)...but as you can see it is not working. please note that i don't necessarily need to use callable, it can be any other interface."
