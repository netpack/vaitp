"facing issues in doing round off in blank i have to show the fund value to customers for the next 30 years in one of my application , but the issue is there are some decimal values present , so we have to do the round off those values so that we will be calculated properly .e.g we there are values like, 414.598940334717 , it should round off to 414.60 but it is not getting round off with this function till 414.61 according to the spreadsheet..i have written this method..bigdecimal bd = new bigdecimal(double.tostring(414.598940334717));..bd = bd.setscale(2,bigdecimal.round_half_up );"
