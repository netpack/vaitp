"generate array list of dynamic type in blank what i have is a super class..class geometry{.}...and two classes that extends it:..class shapeone extends geometry{}..class shapetwo extends geometry{}...what i want to achieve is to generate a list(read from the database) of objects of the type shapeone or shapetwo or any other that is instance of geometry, but dynamically passing the type as a parameter,.for example like:..public arraylist&lt; geometry object &gt; getlist(/**passing typeof generated list**/){.  // getting data from database;.  return new arraylist&lt;typeof generated list&gt;();.}..so the call would be then like:. getlist(shapetwo);...thanks for any help :)"
