"handling encoded/decoded inputs i'm using ..urldecoder.decode(data,""utf-8"")...to decode my string, e.g. 100%20natural => 100 natural..now the fun part, data can be already encoded, or decoded. so if i have something likes ""100% natural"", it will result in exception...at the moment i'm laying on exception to get the correct value, so in case exception happened, i returned the original value...how i can handle this situation better without laying on the exception to detect if my data needs to be decoded or not? since throwing exception is also expensive...thank you."
