is there possibility to put a lock after a method? i am creating tictactoe game and i wanted to create a loop(below). player can be human or computer. now i would like to make code wait until a statement inside  method player.move()  will  unlock. how to achieve that?..while(!finished){. player player = fetchnextplayer();. player.move();//move suppose to encourage human player to click on a certain jbutton. lock;//until there is a line in move() saying to unlock..}...the deal is that move() in case of player should just encourage player to click on a button and if fetchnextplayer() returns instance of computerplayer extends player it suppose to automatically click a certain button. if there will be no lock the computerplayer will not wait until human player clicks the button.
