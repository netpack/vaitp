"split a string by commas except when the comma is part of the sentence i have strings like this ..""'hello, how are you?','string',123""...i need to split it so it looks like..[""'hello, how are you'"", ""'string'"", ""123""]...but when i use string.split("",""), i get this:..[""'hello"", ""how are you'"",""'string'"",""123""]...how can i split by comma but only when it's not between single quotes?"
