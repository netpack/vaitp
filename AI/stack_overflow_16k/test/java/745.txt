"get utc time without relying on os time is it possible in blank to get utc time without relying on os time settings?..for example in blank 8 time api instant.now() returns time in utc. if i change system time in os to 30 minutes ahead it will give me utc time + 30 minutes...is there a clock that doesn't depend which os settings is used, some kind of machine clock? if so, how to use it from blank."
