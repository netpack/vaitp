"""working"" jar archive can be opened through console but not directly with the blank.exe does anyone know that problem?.i thought you could open executable .jar files with the blank.exe...when i run the .jar file from the cmd console with blank -jar filename.jar it works completely fine and runs as intended..but when i tell it to open with the same blank.exe that begins to run when i use the console command it gives:..error: could not find or load main class filepath/filename.jar.caused by: blank.lang.classnotfoundexception: filepath/filename.jar...i first tried it with the blank.exe in /bin/ from the built-in jre from the jdk...then i downloaded the jre from oracle's website and used the blank.exe in the /bin/ folder there."
