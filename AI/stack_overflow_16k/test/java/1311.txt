"product loop user asked how many product most expensive i am having a time with this program. would someone please tell me what i am doing wrong? the program prompts the user to enter the number of products in the product catalog. the program should then prompt the user for the name and the price of each product in the product catalog. once all of the products have been entered, the program should output the product information (name and price) of the most expensive product in the catalog. your solution to keep track of the product with the highest price...import blank.util.scanner;..public class producttester.{.    private static final string price = null;..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.        system.out.print(""enter the number of products: "");.        int count = in.nextint();.        int name = 1;.        int item = 1;.        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= count; i++) {.            system.out.print(""enter the name of product "" + item + "" :n"");.            string name1 = in.tostring();.            system.out.print(""enter the price of product "" + item + "" :"");.            int price = in.nextint();..            item++;.        }.        system.out.println(""product = "" + name + ""$ "" + price);.    }.}...when i run this program, it asks me how many times and when i put it in both of the questions come up and i am unable to enter anything,  actually, the product question is suppose to come up first and then the price question."
