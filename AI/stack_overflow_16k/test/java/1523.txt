"string prints specific number of words in to a new line i wonder how can i change my code so, that the number of given value words was specified in another class. and in construction class i need to make a method that prints in every given value. here is my code:..public void wordbox().    {.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; words.length(); i++).        {.        if (words.length() % wordsperline == 0 &amp;&amp; words.charat(wordsperline) == ' ').            system.out.println();               .        else .            system.out.print(words.charat(i));.        }.        system.out.println();.    }...wordsperline was given in another class as a number of 3..string is this:""the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog""..output should be look like:.the quick brown.fox jumped over.the lazy dog..note: i am not allowed to use any other classes like token or buffer. also, i cannot use replace/split. so, this is what i was given and i need to work from that. ..any help will be appreciated. .thanks"
