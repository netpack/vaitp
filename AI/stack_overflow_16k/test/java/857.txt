"is it possible to pass a list of arguments to a method without declaring them beforehand? given a method such as: ..public void blit(int[] pos) {.   do stuff...}...is there a way to pass in a list of arguments without first declaring them? ..for instance, in python, i could do something like:..def blit(pos):.   stuf.....blit([20,50])...i can simply pass in a list that created specifically in the argument list. to do the equivalent in blank, it seems i have to first declare the array, and only then can i pass it to the method. ..int[] coordinates = {20,50};.blit(coordinates);...which is not a huge deal, but it'd be handy if i could just do something like, ..blit({20,50});...but that, of course, doesn't work. i've also tried creating the array inside of the call like,..blit(new int[] = {20,40});...but again, no luck. so, perhaps a terrible question, but is there a way to pass lists of arguments to a method that mimics in part the behavior of python?"
