"skipping certain parts of a textfile while reading in blank i have a text file that i am reading. it has chunks that i would want to remove. is there a way i can say if the reader comes across a string ""statement of account"" it skips reading the 10 lines before that statement. this is the code i am currently using which is reading everything from the text file...  for(int i = 0; i &lt; filenames.length; i++){.   fileinputstream fstemp = new fileinputstream(""c:/temporary/"" + filenames[i]); .   fileoutputstream fos = new fileoutputstream(""c:/statements/"" + filenames[i]);  .   datainputstream in1 = new datainputstream(fstemp);.   uniquelinereader brtemp = new uniquelinereader(new inputstreamreader(in1));.   bufferedwriter bw = new bufferedwriter(new outputstreamwriter(fos));.   string strline;.   while((strline = brtemp.readline()) != null){.     bw.write(strline);.     bw.newline();.     bw.flush();..   }...    }"
