"progam terminates instantly i'm working on a blank program that asks for numbers from the user and when they don't enter a number it's caught in an inputmismatchexception exception. when the exception occurs twice, the program should end and give the user the sum of the numbers. however, i can't get the program to even run in it's current state. when i run the program it instantly terminates and doesn't even ask for any input. once i get that figured out, i'm not even sure if what i have will work! any guidance is appreciated. ..public static void main(string[] args) {..    float input = 0; .    float sum = 0; .    int count = 0; .    boolean attempt = true;.    scanner in = new scanner(system.in); ..    while (attempt).    {.        try.        {.            system.out.print(""enter a number: ""); .            input = in.nextfloat(); .            sum += input; .        }.        catch(inputmismatchexception e).        {.            system.out.println(""not a number. try again""); .            count ++; .            if (count &gt;=2).            {.                attempt = false; .            }.        }.    }..    system.out.println(""sum: "" + sum); ...}...}"
