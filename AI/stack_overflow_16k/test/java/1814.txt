"blank outofmemoryerror caused by multiple event tiggers? suppose a function in a thread gets called on a specific event, and assume that the function has a runtime of 1 sec and suppose that this event happens 5 times a second, could that lead to blank outofmemory errors? ..basically it is one thread that is open and its role is to listen to messages. each message that comes in will trigger an event. my question, is what happens if this thread receives more messages that it could handle? would that build an event queue that would create an outofmemory exception? or would the messages be ignored?..update:.it must have been a network queue, or some socket issue, messages were received over the network and the result of the processing, after the event was triggered, was written back on the network. when i removed the write back on the network, after the processing, the issue was solved."
