"need to modify this blank program to print only one iteration of each prime factor i have a blank program ""factors"" which takes a command line argument and print its prime factors. for example, if you run the program with the argument 3757208, it will print 2 2 2 7 13 13 397. i need to modify the code so that each prime factor is printed only one time. so with the above example, my desired outcome is 2 7 13 397. thank you! here is the code:..public class factors.{..    public static void main(string[] args) .    { // print the prime factors of n.        .        long n = long.parselong(args[0]);.        long n = n;.        for (long i = 2; i*i &lt;= n; i++) .        { // test whether i is a factor..            while (n % i == 0) .            { // cast out and print i factors                 .                n = n / i;.                system.out.print(i + "" "");.            }.        }.        // if biggest factor occurs only once, n &gt; 1.        if (n &gt; 1) system.out.println(n);.        else       system.out.println();.    }.}"
