_filename.blank meaning in blank .  possible duplicate:.  is there a standard in blank to use _ [underscore] in front of variable or class name  .....can anyone tell whether an underscore before the blank filename has a special meaning or its just a normal blank file? (means can we have a blank file named _abc.blank as a normal blank file or it has some special functions in it)..thanks
