"how to draw an hourglass in blank i just need some pointers. i am new to blank and busy with a task that prints am hourglass. what i am trying to do is write the program so that it will accepts a char from a user and then output an hourglass in the console. this is the instructions...in this question, you are tasked to complete the implementation of the printhourglass(int, char) method for printing out an hourglass of a specific size and symbol...instructions..given the parameters size = n and the character symbol...you can assume that n is a positive odd number...the hourglass consists of n lines...the character symbol will appear a number of times in each line. the symbol will appear n times in the first line. the number of times the symbol printed will be decreased by 2 in each subsequent line until it reaches 1. after that, the number of times the symbol printed will be increased by 2 in each subsequent line until it reaches n again..spaces are added to the start and end of each line so that the total width of each line is n and the symbols in each line are aligned at the center of each line...for outputting, you can use either system.out.print()/println() or io.output()/outputln()...i have seen quite a few posts online but none of then take input or asks for user input or how big the hourglass should be. one that i found that works is this method to output the hourglass..public static void stars(int n, int s){.    if(s &gt; 0){.        system.out.print("" "");. stars(n, s-1);.} else  if (n &gt; 0){.    system.out.print(""*"");.    stars(n-1, s);.} else {.    system.out.println();.}...but this will only print the it with an asterix. i was thinking of starting my method like this..public static void printhourglass( int size, char symbol)..i obviously dont want to copy other peoples code so please give me some pointers as to how i can get his method to work...thanks"
