"listing public methods on a class without creating an instance the test framework i'm using has a rather strange way of adding tests to a test suite, as follows:..public testsuiteall() {.    super(""testsuiteall"")..    this.addtest(new testtypeold(""test_execution""));.    this.addtest(new testtypeold(""test_completion_1""));.    this.addtest(new testtypeold(""test_completion_2""));..    this.addtest(new testtypenew(""test_new""));.}...where ""test_execution"" is for example, the name of the function in the testtypeold class to call. ..i really don't like this design but i'm stuck with it. how can i list all the functions in testtypeold so that i can add all of them? ..i've see some examples where something like this is done:..testtypeold testtypeold = new testtypeold("""");.class testtypeoldclass = testtypeold.getclass();.method[] methods = testtypeoldclass.getmethods();...but this seems really long winded. is there another way of doing this where i don't need to create a instance of testtypeold."
