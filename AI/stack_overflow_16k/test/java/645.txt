"does the number of methods in a blank object affect how heavy it is? i often read about heavy blank objects and how making multiple instances of such objects can hamper performance. the singleton pattern is suggested as a solution to this problem. correct me if am wrong , i think a heavy blank object is one which has a huge number of variables or  variables which have a huge number of variables inside them leading to the consumption of large amount of memory. my question is , will a class which has a huge number of methods but very few variables also count as a heavy object?"
