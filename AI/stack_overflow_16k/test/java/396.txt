"reverses in arraylist strings i am trying to reverse some contents of strings in an arraylist , and i was wondering if this was possible using standard classes [.reverse().tostring() in particular]. for example, i have an arraylist with the following entries in them:..    mysuperarray=[the cost of apple is usd2, the cost of oranges are usd1.50]...and what id want is something which reverses these strings in the above array: like:..    harray=[2dsu si elppa fo tsoc eht, etc..]...what i am using at the moment is something like:..    arraylist&lt;string&gt; harray= new arraylist&lt;string&gt;();.    harray = new stringbuffer(mysuperarray).reverse().tostring();...where, mysuperarray is defined the same way as harray...but i get a compile error at this stage:..    cannot find symbol.    symbol  : constructor stringbuffer(blank.util.arraylist&lt;blank.lang.string&gt;).    location: class blank.lang.stringbuffer.    harray = new stringbuffer(mysuperarray).reverse().tostring();...why do i get this compile error? what could be wrong?.sorry if the question is a rather newbie question."
