"what are the possible ways to store this data? well, i need this data to be used in at least two classes:..   string navhome = ""home"";.    string navabout = ""about"";.    string navupload = ""upload"";.    string navuploadproc = ""uploadproc"";.    string navstartupload = ""startupload"";.    string navcontact = ""contact"";.    string navsearch = ""search"";.    string navmanual = ""manual"";.    string navbacktogmis = ""backtogmis"";...i was thinking of just pasting that into other classes, but then it violates the principles of programming, since it's repeating the same thing. text and xml files are not comfortable to store data, inheritance isn't an option, since blank doesn't support multiple inheritance... any ideas?..yeah, i know it will sound retarded to most of you, but i need tipps on this."
