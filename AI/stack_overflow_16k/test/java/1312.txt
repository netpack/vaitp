"loop with if inside for 2 threads i'm having trouble getting the output i want. therefore, these are two threads running in the critical section. one of the threads prints ""a"" and the other prints ""b"". the threads have to print until 30 chars. after that, the thread printing next should print a new line and reset.the character counter to 1. i can get get them printed, but i couldn't find a way to print the last char (31) and reset the counter to 1 and break the loop and exit. ..my program is running until you force it to stop because i'm setting the loop to the start point. .i know that i could've gotten it by setting do -while (counter &lt;=30), but i want it to be first set to while (true).thanks for your help."
