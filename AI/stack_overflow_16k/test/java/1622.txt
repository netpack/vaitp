"ellipsis behavior (...) in method signature with an iterable? say i have a method (in a library so i can't modify it) like so:..public void ellipsisarg(object...objects){.    for(object object : objects){.        dosomething(object);.    }.}...if i pass a collection or an iterable to this method, what will happen? will the for() loop iterate over the collection, or will it accept the collection as one object and pass the whole thing to dosomething()?"
