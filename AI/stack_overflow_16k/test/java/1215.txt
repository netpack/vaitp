"conversion of string to stringbuilder object so that reverse option can be applied to string basically, i am converting decimal to binary for which i have defined a method conversionbinarydecimal(), in which i am passing an integer n to it and each time i divide n by 2 and add remainder to string variable inbinary by  concatenation. .but when i am adding remainder it's getting stored in opposite order. for example: 6 binary is 110 but it is stored as 011. so, i want to reverse the string to get exact answer. for this i am using stringbuilder to convert it to mutable string but when i am using reverse inbuilt method to it. it says configure assignment...i have tried search everywhere to get the why it is so? but i am not getting it...package conversionbinarydecimal;.import blank.lang.*; .import blank.io.*; .import blank.util.*;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class conversionbinarydecimal {.    static void decimaltobinary(int n){.        string inbinary = """";.        while(n&gt;0){.            int temp = (n%2);.            inbinary += temp;.            n=n/2;.        }.        stringbuilder input1 = new stringbuilder(); .        input1.append(inbinary); .        input1 = input1.reverse(); .        system.out.println(inbinary);.    }..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        // todo code application logic here.        scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);.        int n = sc.nextint();.        decimaltobinary(n);..    }..}...i am getting compiler error..the expected output is binary of any number. for example: 6: 110"
