"how to get a random integer in blank? i'm trying to get a random integer, but the way i'm doing it takes a really long time to get that random number ( like 10 seconds!)..random generator=new random();.do {.    id=generator.nextint();.}.while(id&lt;=0||id&gt;=4);...i'm trying to get a random number between (and include) 0 to 4.this code so far gets the job done, but 10 seconds is too long!..what is a better way to do this?..thanks!"
