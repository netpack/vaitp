"data structure for an array of dictionary entries i am looking for a native way (preferably) in blank to implement a data structure to hold an int as key and a set of key/value pair as the value. in essence if would be an array of dictionaires referenced by an index...ex:..mydatastructure[[key,value]] foo = new .....foo.put[[""hello"", ""world""], [""so"",""rocks""]]...println(foo[0].getvalue(""hello"")) would print out ""world"" and println(foo[0].getvalue(""so"")) would print out ""rocks"""
