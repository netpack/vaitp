"blank - make variable persistent on multiple method calls i want the variable called ""number"" to stay the same value when the method is called multiple times. it seems like it resets between each method call. i don't see why it would because the variable is declared outside the method. ..this is the first class:..import blank.util.scanner;..public class input {..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        for(int counter = 0; counter &lt; 5; counter++) {.            output display = new output();.            display.outputnumber();.        }..    }..}...this is the second class:..public class output {..    int number;..    public void outputnumber() {.        number++;.        system.out.println(number);.    }..}...when i run this, it outputs ..1.1.1.1.1...i want it to output:..1.2.3.4.5"
