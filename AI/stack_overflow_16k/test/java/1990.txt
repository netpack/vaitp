"how can i bring the program behind the pop up window? as you can see below in my code when clicks on the helpsection method a pdf file opens. i was wondering instead of the pdf being behind the program, how can i bring that window in front of the program? i tried using desktop.setvisible(true); however, i had no luck i got the error messages.......program code..import blank.util.scanner; //taking input from user.import blank.io.file;.import blank.awt.desktop;..public static void helpsection() {.        try {.            desktop.getdesktop().open(new file(""cvliamdocherty.pdf""));.            desktop.setvisible(true);.        } catch(exception e) {.            system.out.println(e);.        }.        system.out.println(""would you like to go back into the program to select a course to find out your grade?"");.        system.out.println(""you can enter 'yes' or 'no' only."");.        outcome2 = userinput.next();.        if (outcome2.equalsignorecase(""yes"")) {.            step1();.        } else if (outcome2.equalsignorecase(""no"")) {.            system.out.println((username)+"" thanks for using liam's ucas grade calculator."");.            system.exit(0);.        } else { .            system.out.println(""you have entered an invalid value."");.            system.out.println(""the program now will re run, make sure to enter the correct value next time."");.            step1();.        } .    }"
