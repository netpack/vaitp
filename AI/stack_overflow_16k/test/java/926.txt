"avoid escape while parsing json string i have an input json string contains few special characters which are already escaped and some special character(like en-dash/em-dash) which are not escaped. after parsing this json string(need to parse this string to retrieve an array of objects), it is converting a string with special characters to unicode value(for example en-dash character to u2013). my requirement is to not escape any special character and keep the other already escaped characters as it is. in simple terms, after parsing json string, content should not change...please suggest some approach to handle this...after parsing, i have tried unescaping it using stringescapeutils. but it is converting even the other special character..one way is to search the string if contains any unicode character and escape only that part. but special characters are not fixed. it can be anything. ..example: ..{.    ""orders"": [.        {.            ""name"": ""helloâ€“worldntext"",.            ""type"": ""textn"".        },.        {.            ""name"": ""hello"",.            ""type"": ""text"".        }.    ].}...for above string when i parse using org.json.simple,it is escaping endash character to ""hellou2013worldntext"" for name field. is there a way, i can restrict escaping of special characters while parsing."
