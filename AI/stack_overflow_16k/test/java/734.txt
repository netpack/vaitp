"how to reduce copy-pasting? if i have a number of similar classes, say:..integer i0;.integer i1;.integer i2;.integer i3;.integer i4;.integer i5;.integer i6;.integer i7;.integer i8;.integer i9;...and wanted to avoid doing this:..i0 = 0;.i1 = 1;.i2 = 2;.i3 = 3;.i4 = 4;.i5 = 5;.i6 = 6;.i7 = 7;.i8 = 8;.i9 = 9;...i'm thinking of doing something similar to this to achieve the same result:..int cnt = 0;.for(classname : arrayofclassnames {.    classname = cnt++;.}...how do i do that?..[clarification] i appears i was misunderstood. i was thinking more along the lines of having 10 separate classes still, not one array having 10 items."
