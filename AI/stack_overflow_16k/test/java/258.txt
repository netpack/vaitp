"assigning an integer to a char i've been wondering about the reason why in blank we can assign an integer number directly to a char variable:..char a = 6;...but we can't assign an integer without a type cast ..int bint = 6;.char b = bint; // error, cast first...i do understand that char is just 16-bit unsigned integer in the background, and that generally if we want to move a value from a wider range type to a lower range one, type cast needs to be explicit. but why is that not the case in the first example, what is the type of the 6 literal ?"
