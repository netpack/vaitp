"easiest way to read a string from a rs-232 port? i have a custom made board which reads different metrics from various sensors (e.g. temperature in celcius, pressure in bars) and sends them by a rs-232 port as a string with a ""channel"" (a mnemonic of the sensor) and the actual reading e.g. ""a14.23"" or ""b33.0""...i need to read and parse that info in blank and send it to a jms queue for further processing in another app. the requirement is that it must work on windows xp/7...i was reading that oracle blank communications api is implemented just for linux/solaris systems so this discards it for this project. ..any suggestions?"
