"accessing instance variables from objects in a list i'm working on a self-assigned project over break, and am running into one major sticking point.  this is a basic line-recognition program in blank. ..i have a points class which creates the point from the ordered pairs &amp; sends it to the line class for slope &amp; intercept calculation.  the results are sent back to the points class which deposits the results into the arraylist linelist.  there are three parts to each line object: the slope &amp; intercept integers and the point from which they were calculated from...from a loop, how can i access the slope &amp; intercept variables from each object in the linelist for comparison?  since i don't want to compare the points, just the slope &amp; intercept, the equals() method is not what i need."
