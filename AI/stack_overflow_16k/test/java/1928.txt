"difference between two sorted arrays im trying to create a method that it´s able to print the difference between two sets of numbers ..in this case, i want to make the difference (h1 - h2) or in other words, print all the elements of the array h1 that are not also in h2...so far this is what i have come up with, and it works only if the numbers of the first set h1 are smaller than the ones of the second set h2, but i want to make it work under any given set...i would really apreciate any idea that you might have, thanks ¡..private void metododifference(int[] h1, int[] h2, int m, int n) {.        int i = 0, j = 0;.        arraylist&lt;integer&gt; arraydifference = new arraylist&lt;&gt;();.        while (i &lt; m &amp;&amp; j &lt; n) {..            if(h1[i] &lt; h2[j]) {.                arraydifference .add(h1[j++]);.                i++;}.            else if (h2[j] &lt; h1[i]){.                arraydifference .add(h1[j++]);     .            }.            else   {.                i++;.                j++;.            }     .            }.            differencetext.settext(arraydifference .tostring());.        }"
