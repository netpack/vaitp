"blank arraylist inheritance problem (looks like a namespace collision) i'm new to blank (three days spend actually), but i have to write a custom cross-platform editor app as an interface to my database. everything is running smooth actually, but i've got a strange package error. inb4 3 years of python and as3 programming.  ..i'm trying to extend a blank.util.arraylist and got stucked into the add method overriding. code looks somehow like that:..package myxmleditor;..public class barslist&lt;editorxmlobject&gt; extends .    blank.util.arraylist&lt;editorxmlobject&gt; {..@override.public boolean add(editorxmlobject element) {.    editorgui.addeditorpane(element); // error here.    return super.add(element);.}..    public editorguiinterface editorgui = null;.}...barslist, editorguiinterface and editorxmlobject are within the myxmleditor package. the addeditorpane method is ..editorguiinterface.addeditorpane(editorxmlobject element)...netbeans shows me an error:  ..method addeditorpane in class myxmleditor.tsukasaxmleditgui cannot be applied to given types;.  required: **myxmleditor.editorxmlobject**  .  found: **editorxmlobject**  .  reason: actual argument editorxmlobject cannot be converted to myxmleditor.editorxmlobject by method invocation conversion"
