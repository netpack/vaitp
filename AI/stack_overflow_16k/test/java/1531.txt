creating classes based on object.class i want to define a list of classes and instantiate them later. i have a list like this ...list&lt;class&gt; classlist = new arraylist&lt;&gt;();.classlist.add(classa.class);.classlist.add(classb.class);...i want to read from this list and create the classes. i don't know witch classes i have to create since clients of my library will define this list. all i know is all of this classes extend from the same class and have one object as constructor argument. ..any idea how should i achieve this?
