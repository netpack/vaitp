"limit number guessing game to three attempts i'm trying to make a game where the user has 3 chances to guess a random number that the program generates. i have this code so far, but i don't know how to get the program to stop after the user inputs 3 out of 3 guesses. if the user is not able to correctly guess in 3 tries, i want the program to say ""you loose. the number was ...""..import blank.util.random;.import blank.util.scanner;.class guessnumber {.    public static void main(string args[]) {.        random random = new random();.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);.        int min = 1;.        int max = 10;.        int comp = random.nextint(max - min + 1) + min;.        int user;...        do {.            system.out.print(""guess a number between 1 and 10: "");.            user = input.nextint();..            if (user &gt; comp).                system.out.println(""my number is less than "" + user + ""."");.            else if (user &lt; comp).                system.out.println(""my number is greater than "" + user + ""."");.            else.                system.out.println(""correct! "" + comp + "" was my number! "" );.        } while (user != comp);.    }.}"
