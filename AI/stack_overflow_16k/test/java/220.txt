"converting string to appropriate blank object i have a string in this format (including curly brackets):..{id=123, vehicle_name=tesla model x, price=80000.00, ... }...what is the appropriate blank object to represent this string, and how can i convert it to that object?..i would like to be able to query the object to retrieve its values easily, eg. obj.get(""vehicle_name""). i've tried converting it to json using jsonobject however this expects colons as the delimiters between keys and values, rather than the equals sign."
