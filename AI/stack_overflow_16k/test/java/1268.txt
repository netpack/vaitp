"editing a cell in a jtable seems to alter the behavior of the table after a tab button is pressed i have a jtable and i intend to add a row each time the tab button is pressed whilst the cell that corresponds to the last row and the last column has focus. the code on netbeans is as follows..private void tblreplenishkeypressed(blank.awt.event.keyevent evt) {                                        .    if(evt.getkeycode()==keyevent.vk_tab ){.        int rows = tblreplenish.getrowcount()-1;.        int columns = tblreplenish.getcolumncount()-1;.        if(tblreplenish.getselectedrow()==rows &amp;&amp; tblreplenish.getselectedcolumn()==columns){.            model.addrow(new object[]{});.        }.        if(tblreplenish.getselectedcolumn()==0){.            string code = model.getvalueat(tblreplenish.getselectedrow(), 0).tostring();.            model.setvalueat(supplier.get(code), tblreplenish.getselectedrow(), 1);.        }.    }.} ...the only problem is that if the tab button is pressed soon after editing whilst the cursor is still blinking inside the last cell at the bottom, no row is added but focus is given to the cell that corresponds to row 1 and column 1. any help will be appreciated as i am new to blank"
