"bean scripting framework i'd like to use the bean scripting framework to make some of my blank classes be available to users at my company who wish to write scripts + who may be familiar with blankscript or python (via jython) or ruby (via jruby)...i can't really find much tutorial documentation on how to get bsf working... what i would like to do is make a blank app that runs a shell, either in blankscript or jython or jruby, and exposes some blank classes of mine to the scripting language...any pointers? i've glanced through some of the docs at the bsf resources page but i have a feeling i'm missing something obvious to get started...(like there must be some shell already out there, complete w/ a rudimentary debugger...)..edit: to clarify -- i know how to run bsf.jar, it works fine. and i know how to run the blankscript shell with rhino -- but that's specific to blankscript and has nothing to do with bsf. my question is, is there a language-agnostic shell that works with bsf?"
