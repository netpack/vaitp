"comparing an element in two different list that are different objects i will post my code, but just change the names. i'll add comments when i can add more info. ..list&lt;abstracta&gt; foo = bar.getfoo; // this returns an arraylist&lt;e&gt; with two objects. each object has an id and price. ..list&lt;name&gt; names = null;.try{.   names = someclass.getnames(); // this returns an arraylist&lt;e&gt; with 10 name objects. each one has an id, name, description.}catch(exception e){.   log.warn(e);.}...my main goal is compare the two lists. i have.....iterator&lt;name&gt; object = names.iterator();.while(object.hasnext()){.   name j = object.next(); // assign next name.   system.out.println(""j.getid(): "" + j.getid()); // this provides me the id.   system.out.println(""foo.contains(j.getid()) "" + foo.contains(j.getid())); // keeps spitting out false but i want it to be true..   if(foo.contains(j.getid())){.      object.remove(); //remove name out of names list.   }.}...i'm not sure if this makes a lot of sense of what i am trying to do. .there are two beans in this program representing foo and name. so they are different objects and i think that may be the issue. ..any suggestions? sorry if this is very vague.....my main question is, if i want to compare an element in these two lists, what is the best way to do this?"
