"converting from a 32-bit two's complement to decimal using blank i'm having trouble finding a way to convert from a 32-bit two's complement binary number to a decimal in blank. i either get an overflow error or the number comes out nonnegative when it should be negative. ..string bin = ""11111111111111111111111111111110"";.long foo = long.parselong(bin);.system.out.println(foo);...this is one of the things i tried and i was thinking i needed to use long because it can hold up to 64-bits. any help would be great. thanks"
