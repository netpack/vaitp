"does blank pass by reference for blankfx stage? this has been bothering me for a while. i've always thought that blank passes variable by value (creating completely another similar object within called method to be used as parameter and it should not have any reference to original object) ...and when i passed blankfx.stage.stage object to a method in 'controller' class (controller for fxml), the change within the passed stage also affected the original stage. doesn't this mean an object is passed by reference?..my code:..in controller class:..    //register stage.    public void registerstage(stage stage){.        this.stage = stage;.    }.    //mouse pressed.    public void mouseclicked(mouseevent event){.        x = event.getscenex();.        y = event.getsceney();.    }    .    //mouse dragged.    public void mousedragged(mouseevent event){.        stage.setx(event.getscreenx()-x);.        stage.sety(event.getscreeny()-y);.    }...in start method of main class extendingblankfx.application.application :.. controller controller = loader.&lt;controller&gt;getcontroller();. controller.registerstage(stage);. stage.show();"
