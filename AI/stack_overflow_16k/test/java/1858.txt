"connection timed out page i have a blank web application that generates a report and i have the ability to export that report to an excel file, problem is whenever i generate it as an excel file a ""connection timed out"" page is being displayed on a firefox web browser...basically i have no idea why is this happening, i see no problems in my code could it be server issues or the amount of data i'm generating?  also no error logs are being displayed. ..any advise, suggestions would be of great help thanks."
