"serializing object to database i know we can wrap fileoutputstream in objectoutputstream, fileinputstream in objectinputstream and use objectoutputstream.writeobject and objectinputstream.readobject() methods to serialize blank objects to a file. ..if instead of a file i want to serialize the object to a database then all i would need to do is call setobject() method of preparedstatement to write the object and getobject() of resultset to retrieve the object.                  ..if the class for the object we are attempting to serialize has not implemented the serializable interface then in case of serializing the object to file we will get a notserializableexception..however in case of serializing the object to db since we are not at all using writeobject but just using preparedstatement setobject method,so the jvm will throw any exception if class is not serializable. ..so does this mean that while serializing object to database it is not necessary to implement serializable interface?"
