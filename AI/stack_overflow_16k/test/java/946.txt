"how can i recode this nested for loop counting box? the goal of this assignment was for me to create a nested for loop that prints:..0 1 2 3 .1 2 3 4.2 3 4 5.3 4 5 6...while i have attempted the code myself on blank, i was informed there was an issue...i decided to use a third variable, x, which allowed the code to run okay but i was also told to redo the code without it. try as i might to think of how that would work, i am stuck unfortunately..public class inputoutputexample{.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        int x = 0; .        for (int i = 1; i&lt;=4; i++) {.            for (int j=1; j&lt;=4; j++) {.                system.out.print(x+ "" "");.                x++;.            }.            x = x-3;.            system.out.println();.        }.    }.}...can someone help redo the code only using i and j? i would appreciate it. thanks!"
