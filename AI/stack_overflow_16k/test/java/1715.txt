"blank print variations i'm new to blank, and have a bit of confusion between three output options: print, println and printf...i understand that println gives the result while automatically putting each new line under each other, but i can't seem to find a difference between print and printf?..example:..int numone=10;.int numtwo=15;.int numthree=20;..system.out.printf(""number one is %dn number two is %dn number three is %d"",numone,numtwo,numthree);...yet the above example won't work with print... so what makes these two different, and when would i know which one of the three to use when?"
