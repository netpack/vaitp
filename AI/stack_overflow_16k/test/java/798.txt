"annotation processor vs bytecode generation what are the relative merits and demerits of annotation processing respect to bytecode generation (e.g. with asm)? apart from implementation difficulty, why would you prefer one over another?..since a commenter asked, i'm trying to automatically generate implementations for abstract getter/setter methods, but i would like a more general answer. i'm not asking what's the better way to generate getters and setters."
