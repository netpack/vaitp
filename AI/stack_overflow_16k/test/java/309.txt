"create generic names for lots of objects, blank heads up, i am a beginer so please ignore the fact that i have a limited vocabulary!..so i want to make a game of dominoes. i want to make each domino an object so i can know all the important information (like if it is on the board and if so then where) basically the code would look like this if i were just creating the numbers for the domino:..for(int x = 12; x &gt;= 0; x--).{.  for(int y = 0; y &lt;= x; y++).  {.    domino domxy = new domino(x,y);.  }.}...where ""domxy"" if x = 12 and y = 0, the name is dom120 giving each domino a unique name."
