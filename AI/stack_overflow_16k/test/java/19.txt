"how switch works when a case has not been selected i saw this code in the oca blank 8 exam study guide which confused me...int dayofweek = 5;.switch(dayofweek) {.  case 0:.    system.out.println(""sunday"");.  default:.    system.out.println(""weekday"");.  case 6:.    system.out.println(""saturday"");.    break;.}...the book says it prints weekday and saturday. ..why is this? ..i thought the case had to be found to get selected since it is 5 is is not selected so nothing should happen."
