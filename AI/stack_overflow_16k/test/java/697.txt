"call same function present in various classes based on string input in blank is there any way in blank to call the same function which might be present in multiple classes based on the string input we may get from the user during runtime. ..e.g.:..class apple{.    public void print(){.        system.out.println(""apple"");.    }.}.class banana{.    public void print(){.        system.out.println(""banana"");.    }.}...so, if we get a user input as a we need to call the print() function in the apple class or else call the print() method from the banana or any other class based on the inputs we get from the user."
