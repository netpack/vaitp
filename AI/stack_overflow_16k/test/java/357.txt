"string to int while containing characters simple question but i am having trouble. i have an string input that is in this format 12:43. (mm:ss). .i am trying to convert this string in to int (seconds). the only part i don't know how to do is how to get 12 and 43 without getting invalid double error. because it is containing that "":"" in the string, i can't do the usual parse.parseint(string); ."
