"blank associative array sort of thing with more than one data type imagine this:.datatypeforconfigs config.with.string keys, but values of either string, integer, or boolean,.in blank, json can do that, but i'm making a format that goes along the lines of:..number ""coolness"" is 9001 means.int coolness = 9001;..it's method is: read line, read each word, think what to make of it, set it to a variable within it's reach..also: what would happen if another thing had its own place to put config? a null would be read? why? constructor thinks a file has null on it? rage face...say... should i make a class called settingval that when given a getvalue() call it would say what it is?..so:..config[""coolness""].getvalue();..return's 9001..wait:..how on earth would i make the getvalue() method? how? return value wont like this!! oh crap!..solution:..another data type comes in and checks its 'gender' (string, bool, int) and then checks it's value of that 'gender' (strval, boolvar, intvar)..return values are a big problem when dealing with this. i need a stress free version, so maybe i can have a void returning method that runs another method based on what data type it is said to hold! am i right?..i have a temporary solution, setvar works, getvar is get*var, where * is str, bool or int...sadly, i haven't yet been able to properly read it from a file, the method i made to read from a file is not working. it makes a map&lt;string,settingvar&gt;, using a hashmap constructor and returns that map, but seems whenever i try to access a variable from it that variable is null. it is probably because of ioexceptions and filenotfoundexceptions, filenotfound? why? it shouldn't be running until called. oh, and also nullpointerexceptions please help!..subquestion: what happens when you mapvariable.put({name here}, vartoputin) many times in a for loop? what about mapvariable.put({name here},new ...)?..my code in links:..https://gist.github.com/anonymous/66c4d1c2d2718a4cc9b9..because i don't have enough reputation........p.s: ok! ive made the config reader work now, and settingvar, and settingcontainer and im working on configwriter which is good, now working on a prototype for a blank command prompt like thing, and soon a whole os!! wait... blank is an os. thats why blank virtual machine... oh. well, how can i close this question and turn the outcome into a revolutionary new thingy for kids who want to learn to code blank *cough cough* especialy ones with higher learning ability than social ability... and like to hang around with mature people who dont bully them like all the kids in their school. (wow, that was specific)"
