"returning new collection instead of existing collection instance variable i was having trouble understanding the following snippet:..public class person {.   private list&lt;person&gt; people = new arraylist&lt;person&gt;();..   public list&lt;person&gt; getpeople() {.      return new arraylist&lt;person&gt;();.   }.}...edit: sorry, maybe i got my terms incorrect. i guess i've seen code like this where a new collection is returned, and there is a collection instance variable for that class.  so i was wondering what the implications were."
