"converting a string to byte[] such that the contents remain same i have a string say string a = ""abc"";. now i want to convert it into a byte array say byte b[];, so that when i print b it should show ""abc""...how can i do that?.getbytes() method is giving different result...my program looks like that so far:..string a=""abc"";.byte b[]=a.getbytes();...what i want is i have two methods made in a class one is .public byte[] encrypt(string a).and another is .public string decrypt(byte[] b).after doing encryption i saved the data into database but when i am getting it back then byte methods are not giving the correct output but i got the same data using string method but now i have to pass it into decrypt(byte[] b) .how to do it this is the real scenario."
