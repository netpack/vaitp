overriding superclass constructor i have two classes : year  and leapyear setting the days of the year to 365 and 366 respectively within their constructors. i want to achieve something specific here.i want to override the year's constructor in the leapyear's constructor to set the number of days to 366? alternatively i have done the following...public class year {..private int days;..public year() {.    this.days = 365;.}.public void setdays(int days) {.    this.days = days;.}..public int getdays() {.    return this.days;.}...}..public class leapyear extends year {..public leapyear() {.    setdays(366);.}...}
