"gradebook loop during the cases i'm writing a program that asks the user if he wants to average grades or quit, then asks for the students name, then it will allow the user to input grades into 3 different categories, it will loop until he is ready to quit and presses -1...i created my switch and everything is working pretty good, but how can i loop in case 1, 2, or 3? case 1 will be to average homework grades, it will average those homework grades and display them, then itll move to case 2, average those grades and display, which is quiz grades. then it will move to test grades, user enters grades, presses -1, averages them, then after the third case it will average all of the student's grades using this formula:..final average = 0.25*homeworkavg + 0.25*quizavg + 0.50*testavg = 64..how can i add a loop to keep asking for grades, then move on? i feel like i'm sort of on the right track. thanks!..import blank.util.scanner;..public class assignment3 {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner dylan = new scanner(system.in);..        double homework;.        double quiz;.        double test;.        int choice;.        int choicetwo;.        string name;..        system.out.println(""enter 1 or 2: n 1 - average grades n 2 - quit"");.        choice = dylan.nextint();..        if (choice == 1) {.            system.out.println(""enter the students name"");..            name = dylan.next();..            system.out.println("" what would you like to do? n 1 - homework grades n 2 - quiz grades n 3 - test grades n -1 - quit"");.            choicetwo = dylan.nextint();..            switch (choicetwo) {.                case 1:.                    system.out.println(""enter homework grades"");.                    break;.                case 2:.                    break;.                case 3:.                    break;.                default:.                    if (choicetwo == -1 || choicetwo != 1 || choicetwo != 2 || choicetwo != 3) ;.                    system.out.println(""exiting program"");.                    break;.            }..        } else if (choice == 2) {.            system.out.println(""exiting program."");.        } else {.            system.out.println(""invalid response, exiting program."");.        }..    }..}"
