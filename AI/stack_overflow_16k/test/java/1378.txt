"blank: adding a parallel process and simple write to file i'm helping a grade 11 student with her intro to blank project. it's a simple quiz game i'm familiar with scripting and stuff but i'm not exactly sure how to add a second thread/process/not sure what the proper name is in blank so that i can have a countdown timer running while waiting for user input. also, i want to write a highscore to a textfile (with name), is there a super straightforward way of doing that?..i'm looking for the simplest approach so that i can easily explain it to her?"
