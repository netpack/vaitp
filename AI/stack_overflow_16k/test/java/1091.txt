"get a bufferedimage output composed of several image layers for my current work, i need to add images on top of other images at runtime. i already searched and i don't want to draw it on a swing component, i use it in an external api. .ideally, i would like a library (or a blank-native way) with which i can specify several images to ""layer"", and it would return me a bufferedimage (or any image object by the way)."
