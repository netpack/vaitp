"alternate solution for nested 'for' loop for(opv=230;opv&lt;245;opv++).{   .   for(ikw = 1.3; ikw &lt;= 2.9; ikw += 0.1).   {.      for(okw = 0.01; okw &lt; 0.50; okw += 0.01).      {.         for(opi = 0.05; opi &lt; 1.10; opi += 0.01).         {.           system.out.println( opv+"" ""+ikw+"" ""+okw+"" ""+opi"""")   .         }.      }.  }.} ...i want to print these data together but i don't want to use nested for loops its creating problem and i am not even getting the range of data which i have given in a loop. is there any solution rather than nested for loop. please suggest me..@andreas you can see the loop is going infinite i dont want that i want the following output: ..opv   ikw okw   opi.230, 1.3, 0.01, 0.05.231, 1.4, 0.02, 0.06 .232, 1.5, 0.03, 0.07 .233, 1.6, 0.04, 0.08 ...after the range will complete one's then it should repeat again .private static final int record_count =5;.  i want it should be increase as my record_count will ..example if i have entered recor_count =5 it should display only 5 records and it should be cumulative"
