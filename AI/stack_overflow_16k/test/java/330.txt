"adding another set strings to treeset - blank i have a public method (called getmusic) in a class called favorites. getmusic has set. there are 3 sets and in each set has five words, set getmusic(). in another class called myinterest, there is a treeset called musictable. i called getmusic method into myinterest class but i do not know how to iterate over so that the set of words can be added to musictable treeset. i tried to use addall but it's not working. where i am going wrong and how do i fix this? .i don't want to use list, i've thought about for loop but not to sure how to use this or literate(). thank you..public class myinterest.{..  private static treeset&lt;string&gt; musictable = new treeset&lt;string&gt;();  ..  public test().   {.     super();.     musictable = new treeset&lt;string&gt;();.   }...  public static void testout().  {..    favorites entrainment = new favorites(); ..    system.out.println("" "" + entrainment.getmusic());..    entrainment.addall(musictable); //error msg ""cannot find symbol - method addall(blank.util.treeset&lt;blank.lang.string&gt;)..    musictable.addall(entrainment); //also tried this way but error msg ""cannot find symbol - method addall(favorities) .  }..}"
