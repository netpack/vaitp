"blank - storing a ""score"" from play to play i wish to be able to keep a score that a player gets when playing my game from game to game and to when they close the game and re-open the scores are still saved. the only way i can think of is to do so using a text file, like i would of done in vb6. however, that then means that they can edit the text file? or not? my score is stored in a ""double"" that can be accessed from any class and is being transferred around classes as it is, if that makes a difference...hope someone can suggest the best way to go about this."
