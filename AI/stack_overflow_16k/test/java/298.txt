"how to prevent developers from use risky methods i'm looking for a way to prevent developers from using some methods that are causing instability (performance) issues for the site; for example, i have a method fetches the information from the database (e.g. getdata(string id)), and another method fetches the information form the in-memory cache (e.g. getcacheddata(string id)). the getdata(string id) method is used in getcacheddata(string id) if and only if we have a cache-miss. how can i prevent developers from using getdata(string id) method? in other words, i need to force developers to use getcacheddata(string id) always...please note that the access modifiers (private, protected, etc.), code design, or blank docs are not really preventing developers. do we have a final solution for this issue?"
