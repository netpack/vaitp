is it immutable class? does this below class is immutable?..class immutable {..  private int x;..  immutable(int value) {.    this.x = value;.  }..  public int getx(){.    return x;.  }.}....class is not final since no member is visible to sub class.instance variable x is not final since there is no setter method....is there any possiblity this class will break the contract of immutable functionality without adding any code in this class?
