"calculating number of pizzas needed and slices leftover i need help figuring out how to modify my program to calculate the number of pizzas needed and then the remainder of slices. so for example if the user inputs 18 people you would need 2 pizzas (since there are 20 slices per pizza) and there would be 4 slices leftover. the slices per pizza and how many slices each person eats is constant, 2 slices per person, and 20 slices per pizza. the program asks for the amount of people attending. also i cannot use conditional statements...`..    int pizza = 20;.    int pizzaperson = 2;...    system.out.println(""what is the number of people expected at the pizza party?"");.    int people = integer.parseint(s.nextline());...    int pizzatotal = (people * pizzaperson);.    int pizzaleft = pizzatotal % pizza; .    int total = (pizza / pizzaperson) % people;.            system.out.println(""for "" + people + "" people that would be "" + pizzatotal + "" pizza(s) with each person having "" + pizzaperson + "" slices each."");.            system.out.println(""there would be "" + pizzaleft + "" slice(s) leftover"");...`"
