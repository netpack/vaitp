"blank read utf-8 encoded file, character by character i have a file saved as utf-8 (saved by my application in fact). how do you read it character by character?..file file = new file(folder+name);.fileinputstream fis = new fileinputstream(file);.bufferedinputstream bis = new bufferedinputstream(fis);.datainputstream dis = new datainputstream(bis);...the two options seem to be:..char c = dis.readbyte().char c = dis.readchar()....the first option works as long as you only have ascii characters stored, ie english..the second option reads the first and second byte of the file as one character....the original file is being written as follows:..file file = file.createtempfile(""file"", ""txt"");.filewriter fstream = new filewriter(file);.bufferedwriter out = new bufferedwriter(fstream);"
