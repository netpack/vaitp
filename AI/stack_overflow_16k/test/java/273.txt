"in blank, is there a more optimised way to merge multiple jsonarrays other than iterating and inserting individual elements? i currently have multiple separate jsonarrays which i would like to merge into a single jsonarray. i tried finding some answers and all i could find was to iterate the array and appending individual elements to a new array. ..i'd like to know if there is a more optimised way to do this as i might have a large number of jsonarrays...i tried finding some answers and all i could find was to iterate the array and appending individual elements to a new array. ..consider the code example below...jsonarray arr1 = [.    {.        ""id"" : 123,.        ""name"" : aaa.    },.    {.        ""id"" : 456,.        ""name"" : bbb.    }.];..jsonarray arr2 = [.    {.        ""id"" : 12,.        ""name"" : ccc.    },.    {.        ""id"" : 555,.        ""name"" : ddd.    },.    {.        ""id"" : 7986,.        ""name"" : eee.    }.];...is there a way to merge these and obtain a single jsonarray as mentioned below...jsonarray merged = [.    {.        ""id"" : 123,.        ""name"" : aaa.    },.    {.        ""id"" : 456,.        ""name"" : bbb.    },.    {.        ""id"" : 12,.        ""name"" : ccc.    },.    {.        ""id"" : 555,.        ""name"" : ddd.    },.    {.        ""id"" : 7986,.        ""name"" : eee.    }.];"
