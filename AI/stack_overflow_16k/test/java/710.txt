"blank practice : returning same object which was passed as parameter in the following code, is it really bad practice for updatewithcontex to return the same object it took as a parameter?..class someclass{.   foo updatewithcontex(foo foo){.       foo.setappid(i);.       foo.setxid(index);.       //......       return foo;.   }.}..class foo{..    public void setappid(int appid).    {.       //.    }.    public void setxid(int appid).    {.        //.    }.    public void changestate(x x).    {.       //.    }.}...in c++ , i have seen code like this:.. bigobject&amp;.   fasttransform( bigobject&amp; mybo ).   {.      // when entering fasttransform(), mybo is the same object as the function.      // argument provided by the user. -&gt; no copy-constructor is executed..      // transform mybo in some way.      return mybo;   // transformed mybo is returned to the user..   }...is this also wrong?"
