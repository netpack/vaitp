"how to find cpu,io,memory utilization of a loading page in web application i've written a blank file, using jsp,servlets, that i would like to perform run-time tests on. i've never done this before and was just curious on how to go about it. ..what i'm interested in knowing, besides the actual timings, is how to find cpu,memory and io utilization when running the application.your thoughts are appreciated."
