"changing an id from an int to an object representation we did a big code change changing a node id, which used to be represented by an int, to be now represented by a nodeid object.  the challenging task now is to identify all the places that are using object == to change them to .equals().  the same for the != operator.  ..is there any script or anything that exists or can be written that can identify the places more accurately than a manual eyeballing?..your help is appreciated!..thanks a lot."
