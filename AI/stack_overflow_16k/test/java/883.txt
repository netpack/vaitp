"the output of an operation is always zero what ever the input was i have this code and the output of variable s is always zero:..double v = high; double s; double h;.if (v == 0) {.    s = 0;.    h = 0;.    system.out.println(""v and s and h is zeroo"" + v + s + h);.} else {.    s = (high - low) / high;.    system.out.println(""s is equal to"" + s);.    system.out.println(""high is equal to"" + high);.    system.out.println(""low is equal to"" + low);.    if (s == 0) {.        h = 0;.        system.out.println(""high and low are equals"" + high + ""=="" + low);.    } else {.        double alpha;.        alpha = 60 * (mid - low) / (high - low);.        system.out.println(""alpha is : "" + alpha);..    }.}...example of the output:..s is equal to0.0.high is equal to139.low is equal to30.high and low are equals139==30"
