"how to call a private method that initializes a char array inside constructor blank i am working on my final project in my oop1 class. the language is blank. ..i'd like to know how i invoke the following method inside my constructor:..public garden (int size)    {..    garden=new char[size][size];..    this.initializegarden(garden[][]);.}...private void intializegarden(char [][]garden)   {..    for(int i=0;i&lt;garden.length;i++).        for(int j =0;j&lt;garden.length;j++).            garden[i][j]='-';..}...this.initializegarden(garden[][]); is one of several failed attempts..i've tried a few variations, and eclipse didn't like any of them."
