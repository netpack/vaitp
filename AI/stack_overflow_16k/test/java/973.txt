"simple math issue? for simplicity's sake, i've got the following method to calculate whether the number inputted is binary (only accepts 1's and 0's)..public static void checkbinary(int binarynumber) {.    string bnumber = string.valueof(binarynumber);.    char[] digits = bnumber.tochararray();.    for (int i = 0; i &lt; digits.length; i++) {.        if (digits[i] &gt; 1) {.            system.out.println(""you can't have the digit "" + digits[i]);.            system.out.println(""your number is not a binary number."");.            system.exit(0);.        }.    }.}...however when i try running checkbinary(1010); i get the following output..you can't have the digit 1.your number is not a binary number....any idea why it's counting the initial 1 as greater than 1?..thanks in advance guys!"
