"search through a file with all the words in the dictionary okay so the question is to read in the file and search through it and be able to find words with the letters you entered so for example i enter a??c all the words in the dictionary with a as the first letter and c as the fourth letter would be returned. it is supposed to be used to help solve crosswords..import blank.io.*;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class main {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        newclass reader = new newclass();.        string[] contents = reader.load(""/home/se211012/cs211/text"");..        scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.        system.out.println(""enter word"");.        string s = scan.nextline();.        for (int i = 0; i &lt; contents.length; i++) {..        }.    }.}...reading in the file is fine i have a class that does that as you can see, but i don't know where to go from here. any help would be appreciated."
