"recursive method of multipliction hellp please could anyone help me in this project..write a recursive method that multiplies all values from k up to n and returns the result(as a double). for example: if k= 5, and n= 10, then multiply 5 * 6 * 7 * 8* 9 * 10 to return 151200...in blank code ..public static int multiply(int k, int n) {.if(k == n) {.    return k;.}.return k * multiply(k, n-1);.}"
