"astroid draw blank program problems i'm trying to generate an astroid (not asteroid) graphic similar to this:...this graphic output is generated on a 400x400 drawingpanel. and the math is based on making curves from straight lines. however, i'm having a problem with my x,y coordinates. instead of making the astroid, i'm generating this: ....here is the code:..import blank.awt.*;..public class graphicsproject.{..    //main method.   public static void main (string[]args){.    //initialize the variable.    //the window is 400 x 400 pixels in size.    drawingpanel panel = new drawingpanel (400,400);.    graphics g = panel.getgraphics();.    drawastroid(g,0,0, 400);.    }..   public static void drawastroid(graphics g, int x, int y, int size){ .       int scale = size/40; .       int x1, x2,x3, x4, y1, y2, y3, y4;.       y1 = y;.       y2 = y + size;.       y3 = y + 1/2 * size;.       y4 = y + 1/2 * size;..       x1 = x + 1/2 * size;.       x2 = x + 1/2 * size;.       x3 = x + 1/2 * size;.       x4 = x + 1/2 * size;..       for (int i = 0; i &lt; 21; i++ ){.           //draws upper left.           g.drawline(x4 - scale * i, y4, x1, y1 + scale * i);.           //draws upper right.           g.drawline(x4 + scale * i, y4, x2, y2 - scale * i);.           //draws lower left.           g.drawline(x3 - scale * i, y3, x4, y4 + scale * i);.           //draws lower right.           g.drawline(x3 + scale * i, y3, x2, y2 - scale * i);.        }.    }.}...any insight into how to resolve this would be appreciated."
