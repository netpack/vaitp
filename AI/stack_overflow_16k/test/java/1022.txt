"is there a way that i can show my print statements after the user presses a button or enter? i'm brand new to coding (and stackoverflow), and i am trying to make a choose your own adventure type game. the problem is, when i run the code, it just shows all of my print statements at once, giving me just a huge wall of story text. is there anyway that i can have the user press a key to activate the next portion of text?..i am currently using a scanner (console.nextint()) to take the input of the user's decisions. i would like to do the same thing that this does with the text except instead of entering a number, all the user has to do is press enter to reveal the next bit of text."
