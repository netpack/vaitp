"method not overriding correctly public void run(){.    //this method has a lot of code but it calls the method tick 60 times a second and.    //a method called render as many times as it can.    //other methods are involved to call this but i took them out because there is not problem with them.}..public void tick(){..    tickb();.    //other code i don't want to get overwritten .}..public void render(){..    renderb();.    //other code i don't want to get overwritten .}..public void tickb(){system.err.println(""not overwriting"");}.public void renderb(){system.err.println(""not overwriting"");}...while if i run that code i get the error message as i expected, but when i add this project to another project, and extend mainresources (this class) it will not work...other project..public class main extends mainresources{..    public void tickb(){.        system.out.println(""it worked!"");.    }..    public void renderb(){.        system.out.println(""it worked!"");.    }.}...my problem is i don't get the ""it worked!"", and all code i add gets ignored. i tried adding @override, but that also does not work. also i have checked and everything is running correctly to my knowledge."
