"implement 'maybe' in blank guava's optional class comes dangerously close to being a useful maybe type in blank. all i want to do is extend it a bit:..class maybe&lt;x&gt; extends optional&lt;x&gt; {.  public maybe&lt;y&gt; map(function&lt;x, y&gt; f) {.    if (ispresent()) {.      return maybe.of(f.apply(get()));.    }.    return maybe.absent();.  }.}...is that so hard? apparently yes, it is. blank has no idea what the y type is in the map function, and everything dies horribly. is it possible to write a generic map in blank?"
