"how does one cast a generic type in to a user-defined type? context: we've been tasked with making a small interpreter thing. one of the goals that we was hinted at was for us to not only work with variables of type double, but also to eventually be able to work with any type of variable...way i figured to do this was for to read in the type as a string, and have value set as a generic variable. then we would cast value to whatever type said it should be...i could probably do a bunch of if statements of say.....if(type.equals(""string"")) { /*cast value to string*/ }...but that's so inelegant as to seem to be wrong. also, what if the user were to define a new variable type? i don't think hard coding the possible types is the answer...question: is there a way to, more or less, directly cast a generic variable in to a type that is inputted by the user?"
