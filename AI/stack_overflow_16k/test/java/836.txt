"why can't i instantiate outside any method in blank? please ignore my arrogance......learning blank these days, i came across this perfectly same question for my problem : why can&#39;t i instantiate and create object without main method? (stack overflow error).expecting a possible downvote too...but please go through my question once!!!!..code that i was trying :..public class arrayprg{..    arrayprg ag = new arrayprg(); //ignore this for a while and go thru code please    ..     public static void main(string []args){.        system.out.println(""hello array"");.        new arrayprg().declarearray();.     }...     public void  declarearray().     {.         int[] arr;.         arr = new int[11];.         new arrayprg().assignarr(arr);.     }...     public void  assignarr(int arr[]).     {.         int i;.         for(i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++).         {.             arr[i] = i;.         }.         new arrayprg().printarr(arr);.     }..     public void  printarr(int arr[]).     {.         int i;.         for(i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++).         {.             system.out.println(arr[i]);.         }.     }.}...thinking logically, going through the code you'll see lots of new arrayprg()....what i thought of was to instantiate outside of methods and calling all methods through it there after, but i guess it is not allowed in blank...whats causing my problem..going by the solution in quoted question, as it explain that below thing happens :.. create new instance of arrayprg.      -&gt; ag = create new instance of arrayprg.          -&gt; ag = create new instance of arrayprg.             -&gt; ag = create new instance of arrayprg...explanation given in that question.     .....it is initialized whenever an instance of the class is instantiated. this will never terminate until you run out of memory and get the stack overflow. run it with a debugger for a clearer view...my question. so i have arrayprg ag = new arrayprg(); in my program which is creating a loop every-time i create an instance but why is this called when i am calling the functions through new arrayprg()..what i mean is that when i am calling the function through new arrayprg() inside the methods why is arrayprg ag = new arrayprg(); getting called and creating the loop of error for stackoverflow?????"
