"please can i have some advice with my blank program? void return? please can i have some help with my blank program, i have created the method below, i was just wondering how i could apply this below to my program. ..the last thing to do within the model class, is to add more values to the minefield in order to determine how many mines are adjacent to any given square. created a public method called addnumbers, which has a void return and takes no parameters.previously, values in the_minefield take only two values, 0 (empty_square) and 10 (mine_square). now, any empty square that is adjacent to a mine-filled square will no longer have a value of zero - it now stores the number of mines next to it. this can be any value between 1 (just one mine) and 8 (completely surrounded). squares containing a mine still have a value of ten (mine_square), no matter what is next to them...//declaration of the squares earlier on in the program:.. public static int mine_square = 10;. public static int empty_square = 0;...//the method that needs adjusting...public void addnumbers() {... }"
