"blank code debugging with step by step process highlighting with eclipse i saw this somewhere, but i don't know where. it was basically something in eclipse that was a feature when debugging that highlighted the code as it went through the code. i need this because i have decompiled a huge library, and i need to know how specific features are created...thanks,.neil"
