"how can you parse a string into multiple integer values and store them as their own variable with blank? the following code i have spent several hours on using multiple different strategies for extracting the integer values from the string st and getting them into their own int variables...this is a test program, the actual assignment that i am working on requires me to build a class that will make another program ( program5 ) run correctly. the string generated by program5 could contain more than just three integers, but all will be seperated by a space. because of the specifics of the assignment i am not allowed to use arrays, or regex because we have not covered them in class...as of right now i can't even get it to print out all of the three integers i have in my test string. if anyone sees anything wrong with my syntax or problems with my logic please let me know!..public class test {..public static void main(string[] args){...    string st = ""10 9 8 7 6"";.    int score;.    int indexcheck = 0;.    string subst;..            for(int i=0; i &lt;= st.length(); i++).            {.                if(st.indexof(' ') != -1).                {.                    if(st.charat(i) == ' ').                    {.                        subst = st.substring(indexcheck, i);.                        score = integer.parseint(subst);.                        indexcheck = st.indexof(i);.                        system.out.println(score);.                    }.                }.                else.                {.                    subst = st.substring(st.lastindexof("" ""));.                    score = integer.parseint(subst);.                    system.out.println(score);.                }.            }.}...}"
