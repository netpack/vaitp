"averaging numbers comes out incorect i have tried looking this up on here and still haven't found the exact solution that i am looking for. the math keeps coming out incorrectly...       //local constants.       int count = 0;          //used to track the number of grades entered by the user..       //local variables.       double currentgrade = 0;   //user's current grade inputed.       double numbergrades;       //total number of grades to be entered.       double totalgrade = 0;     //total of all grades.       double gradeaverage;       //average of all grades..       //main function.      //ask the user for the amount of grades they would like to enter.       system.out.print (""how many grades would you like to enter? "");.       numbergrades = scan.nextint();..      //if the user asks to enter 0 numbers, output an error.       while (numbergrades &lt;= 0){.           system.out.print (""please enter a valid number! "");.         numbergrades = scan.nextint();.       }.      //add the grades together as they are input by the user.        while (count &lt; numbergrades){.          totalgrade += currentgrade;.          system.out.print (""please enter your next grade: "");.          currentgrade = scan.nextint();.        count++;.        }.      //calculate and output the average to the user.        gradeaverage = (totalgrade / numbergrades);.        system.out.print (""n"");.        system.out.print (""the average of all grades is: "" + gradeaverage); .  }...}..thought this was fixed, but when i run it i'm still getting the same issue. the example i tried was to enter 3 numbers, each was 50. the average ended up being 33.0. i've run the debugger and it keeps giving me errors once the first number is entered. count, totalgrade and currentgrade all show as errors. no clue how to fix it."
