"how could i set ones diagonally on a defaulttablemodel/jtable? i'm making some uni work, about drawing a letter using numbers (0 and 1) into a (pair number)x(pair number) defaulttablemodel. i've been able to draw u, l, o, but i'm not sure how could i draw a z, specifically, the ""/"" diagonal of the z...i'm pretty confused on this topic, however i've tried to draw the ""/"" part without luck...the following code is just the logic i made to start drawing the z, with 1's on the jtable...defaulttablemodel modelo1 = new defaulttablemodel();.        if (this.filas == this.columnas) {..            modelo1.setnumrows(this.filas);.            modelo1.setcolumncount(this.columnas);.            for (int i = 0; i &lt; modelo1.getrowcount(); i++) {.                for (int j = 0; j &lt; modelo1.getcolumncount(); j++) {.                    if (i == 0) {.                        modelo1.setvalueat(1, 0, j); // draw upper-horizontal line.                    } else {.                         if (i == modelo1.getcolumncount() - 1) {.                            modelo1.setvalueat(1, modelo1.getrowcount() - 1, j); // draw bottom-horizontal line.                         } .                    }.                    // logic to draw the ""/"" diagonal part of the z.                }.            }.        }...image &lt;- that's what it should look. however, my current code simply draws the z without the /...the row/column must be equal, and it's something settable by an user...looking for help from someone."
