"why unnecessarily initialize a variable? we know that there is a default of each primitive data type in blank(for e.g.:- the default value of double data type is 0.0d.).then if we want the value of a variable(suppose double a) to be equal to the default value,why should we need to specify the value as:..double a=0.0d;...why can't we not just use the default value of the variable anywhere as its default value is the same as the value we want to assign?"
