"using try-with-resources in multiple methods with same autocloseable object i am trying to modularize my code but it involves passing around my object that implements autocloseable. let say i have two public methods foo1 and foo2:..public class myclass {.  public void foo1() {.      // connection implements autocloseable.      try (connection conn = createconnection()) {.          foo2(conn);.          // is the connection closed or the behavior unpredictable?.          conn.dosomethingelse();.     }.  }..  public void foo2(connection conn) {.      try (conn) {.          // do something with the connection.      }.  }.}...i want to call foo2 from foo1, but also allow other classes to use foo2 separately...public class otherclass {.    public void dosomething() {.        myclass myclass = new myclass();.        myclass.foo2(createconnection());.    }.}...does this lead to the connection being closed in foo1() after the call to foo2? or should i put the try-with-resources in the calling methods (such as the dosomething() in otherclass)?"
