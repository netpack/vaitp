"getting an error (blank.lang.nullpointerexception) on following code import blankx.swing.joptionpane;..public class speedofsound {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        string medium;.        double time = 0;.        double distance = 0;..        medium = joptionpane.showinputdialog(""please enter a mediumn"" + ""(air, water, steel)"");.        distance = double.parsedouble(joptionpane.showinputdialog(""please enter the distance the soundwave has to travel""));..        if (medium.equalsignorecase(""air"")) {.            time = distance / 1100;.        } else if (medium.equalsignorecase(""water"")) {.            time = distance / 4900;.        } else if (medium.equalsignorecase(""steel"")) {.            time = distance / 16400;.        }..        system.out.println(time);.        system.exit(0);.    }.}...i've never encountered this error and i can't point out what it even is given the code. any help would be appreciated. thanks...edit: someone mentioned that the question is a duplicate. i looked at that question before posting this. again, i don't understand the context of my error. the previous question says the exception happens when the pointer points to ""null"" i can't seem to find an instance where i don't have anything pointing to the respective values."
