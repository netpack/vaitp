"utility method for safe dereference in blank groovy allows me to say..x?.gety()...instead of the verbose..x==null ? null : x.gety()....blank does not allow custom operators, but i can imagine a utility method that's used like so:..safe(x).gety();...is there any standard library in the world's maven repos that does this kind of thing? if no, and i wanted to include it in an open source library (like apache.commons.lang), where would it best fit?..edit: sample implementation of safe():..public static &lt;t&gt; t safe(t x) {.    if (x==null) {.        return new nullreturningmock&lt;t&gt;();.    } else {.        return x;.    }.}"
