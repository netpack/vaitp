"why does the condition in mentioned code blocks succeeds as true? below is a blank code that should evaluate to false as b=false evaluates to 'false' and b is assigned value false. second part of or condition is b==true which is also false as b is false. but when i test run this code in dr. blank editor  i am getting output as check true..boolean b=true; .if(b=false || b==true). system.out.println(""check true"");"
