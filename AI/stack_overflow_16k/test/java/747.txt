"blank method not running i have a quick question. ..i have this method here which says that the variable ""worker"" is not being used.  what kind of syntax would i write below it in order to run it?  i have printed a system.out line and it is not running...        sqlworker worker = new sqlworker(sqlengine.update_high_scores) {.        @override.        public resultset executesql(connection c, preparedstatement st).                throws sqlexception {.            system.out.println(""part 2"");.            return null;.        }.    };...as well as the method not running, eclipse also says ""worker"" isn't being used."
