"initialization in while block? isn't there a cleaner way of doing the following (eliminating the need for initializing line prior to the while block)? it just seems unnecessary to intialize a variable prior to its usage instead of doing something like while ((string line = br.readline) != null) {}. if not, why not?..bufferedreader reader = null;..try.{.    file file = new file(""sample-file.dat"");.    reader = new bufferedreader(new filereader(file));..    string line;.    while ((line = reader.readline()) != null).    {.        system.out.println(line);.    }..}.catch (ioexception e).{.    e.printstacktrace();.}.finally.{.    try.    {.        reader.close();.    }.    catch (ioexception e).    {.        e.printstacktrace();.    }.}"
