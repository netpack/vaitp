"how to change a string in set<string> during foreach iteration? i have a set of strings that i'd like to iterate over, and change all of those who equal something, to equal something else:..// set&lt;string&gt; strings = new hashset().for (string str : strings) {.  if (str.equals(""foo"")) {.    // how do i change str to equal ""bar""?.  }.}...i've tried replace() which didn't work. i've also tried removing ""str"" and adding the desired string, which caused an error. how would i go about doing this?"
