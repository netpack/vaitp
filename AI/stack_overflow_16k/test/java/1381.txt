"solve linear equations with 3 variables that is given by user i'm trying to figure out how to write down a program in blank to solve 2 equations that have 3 variables, which is given by the user:..a11 * x1 + a12 * x2 = b1.a21 * x1 + a22 * x2 = b2 ...numbers are given by user, per say 1 2 3 4 5 6 (for a11 a12 a21 a22 b1 b2).and the answers are ""no solution"" ""many solutions"" ""single solution (x1,x2).i'm stuck.... don't even know where to begin.help?"
