"how can i get all the individual triangles of my model? for reasons of collision detection, i am attempting to iterate through all the triangles in my model...however, how can i get them?..obj files start each vertex position information with a ""v"". i cannot see how to get a triangle of three vertices from that, since i can't know which vertices make up the triangle...i don't care what order the triangles are iterated through in, as long as i am able to get the triangle. how can i get it?"
