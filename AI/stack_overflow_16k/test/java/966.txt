"blank class file runs in project but not outside of project in intellij i just had a quiz where we were supposed to make a hospital class with some given criteria and then instantiate a hospital class in hospitaltester driver class...i completed the assignment without much issue in intellij and it ran fine. ..then i did what i always do, i copy the blank file that i am going to submit, hospitaltester.blank out of the project folder and then submit it on its own (professor doesn't want us to submit projects, just individual blank files). ..i thought i was done and everything was fine, but to my horror i got an email today saying that only 1 person in the class got a 100/100. i went to check what i submitted and when i run it, nothing happens.....all of my code is below and it worked just fine when i opened it up as a project that i saved under as ""quiz 1"", but doesn't run when i remove it from the src folder in the project folder. ..why did this happen?..import blank.text.decimalformat;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class hospitaltester {..    public static void main(string[] args) {..        // construct new hospital instance.        hospital hospital = new hospital(.
