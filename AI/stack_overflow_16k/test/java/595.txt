blank - cannot find symbol with two classes i'm sure i've made a simple mistake here but i'm new to blank so looking for some help...i have one class cat with:..public class cat {.    public double weight = 10.0;.}...and another class heavy with:..public class heavy {..    double gain = 10.0;.    public void total() {.        weight = weight + gain;.    }..}...when i try to compile heavy.blank i'm getting an error saying it cannot find the weight symbol (variable). both files are in the same directory and the cat.blank file has been compiled. what am i missing? appreciate any advice!
