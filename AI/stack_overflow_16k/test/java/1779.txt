iterate through the fields of each object of a linked list below i have got a class with two int variables from which i have created a number of objects which i have stored in the linked list. now i want to loop through each object and compare their fields from the class with other int values. in other words i want to loop through the fields of the objects and not the objects themselves. any help?.. import blank.util.*;.  import blank.io.*;... public class obj . {. int n;. int c;..public obj (int nn). {.  n = nn;.  c = 0;  . }... public static void main(string argv[]) throws ioexception. {..  linkedlist list = new linkedlist();   ..  int i = 7;.  obj element = new obj(i);.  // i may add further objects.... list.add(element);.. // then i want to iterate through the linked list of objects and get each object. // and compare its n or c field values with something else.. // it should sth like the below which i found in the web but i don;t get how it works..for(obj elementf : list) .{.   // process each object inside of object here.. }..}
