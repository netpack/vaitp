"break a programm with a loop i wrote a code which calculates grades. but if i'm typing 9999 in the console, then the program should break without any output. how can i do this and which loop should i use? i tried it with a while loop but the program gives me still output.. this is my code with the while loop which doesn't work as it should. the programm works except for the while loop. how can i do write this better?..import blank.util.scanner;.public class average {..    public static double average (double [] grade ){..        double sum = 0;.        int number = grade.length;..        for(int i = 0; i&lt;grade.length; i++){.            sum+=grade[i];.        }..        double average = sum / number;.        return average;..    }..    public static void main (string [] args){.        scanner s = new scanner(system.in);.system.out.println(""how much grades you add?"");..int number = s.nextint();..while(number == 9999){.    break;.}..double [] grade = new double [number];..system.out.println(""please enter : "");..for(int i = 0; i&lt;grade.length; i++){.    grade[i] = s.nextdouble();.        }.        system.out.println(""my grades are: "");.        for(int i = 0; i&lt;grade.length; i++){.            system.out.println(grade[i] + "" | "");..        }..        system.out.println("""");.        system.out.println(""my average: "" +average(grade));..    }..}"
