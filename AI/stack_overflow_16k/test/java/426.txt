"mapping a string (key) to an xml schema (value) i am trying to map a string (key) to an xml schema with few variable that will change (marked with $ sign)...i am not sure what is the best way to do this in terms of the map to use (hashmap?) and the type to use for the xml schema (map a string to ..?)..also, i am not entirely sure if passing the strings that will change (let's say: id and name for example) as part of the key and replace them or get the schema back and replace the variable once i process the schema again...any help is appreciated."
