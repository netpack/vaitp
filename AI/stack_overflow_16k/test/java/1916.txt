how to generate configuration in blank class from options definition i wonder if there is an nice blank api to generate configuration from a description of options...instead of generate a pojo with getter and setters on your configuration options (we always code the same thing here). i would like to describe my configuration (options of configuration) in a metadata file and then find a way to generate a configuration blank file with all options inside it.
