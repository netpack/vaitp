"why is it necessary to close an audio clip? public void playclick(string file) .    {.        try {.        clip clip = audiosystem.getclip ();.        audioinputstream ais = audiosystem.getaudioinputstream (new file(file));...        clip.open (ais);.        clip.start ();...        }.        catch (exception e).        {.            system.out.println(e);.        }.    }...i've seen a question which is kind of like this one but i guess i'll be a bit more specific...so the code above is a method i put in a separate class to be invoked when the user clicks on a button. it seems to work fine without the .close() but i'm still pretty sure there's got to be some pretty good reason why i should use close() even though the file i'm playing is very small? ..the sound played is only a .wav file which is a very short beep sound, of very small size..also if there are some flaws in the code above that you could point out, please do so...if this happens to be a completely duplicated question, i'll apologize then and i'm hoping you can provide the link to it."
