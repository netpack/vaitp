"instant of interface and class in my code i have seen difference between instant of interface and instant of class that implement it , why ??.i have method that return array of objects of class and implements an interface which declare this method , when create instant  of class and invoke this method the returned value is different if it was invoked by interface instant although it should do the same job , the returned value is different , why??..public interface a{.    public b[] m();.}..public class b implements a {..    public b[] m() {.        b b[]=new b[10];..        for(int i=0; i&gt;10; i++).            b[i]=new b();..        return b;.    }.}...in this part when i try to create two instant one for class and another for interface then invoke the method for each one like : ..b obj1=new b();.a obj2=new b();..system.out.println(obj1.m().equals(obj2.m)); .system.out.println( obj1.m()[0].equals(obj2.m()[0]) );............this returned false...maybe it is clear obj1 is not obj2, but why is the returned value different and how can i get same returned value if possible?"
