please help me understand this piece of code i have a blank project done for school. this is a piece of code which i am having a hard time to understand its logic. please shed some light on it...for(int i = 0; i&lt; leftbut.length; i++){.          int randomnumber =(int)(math.random()*leftbut.length);.             tempnum = leftbut[randomnumber];.            leftbut[randomnumber] = leftbut[i];.            leftbut[i]=tempnum;      ..     }...the leftbut in this case is actually an array of 9 buttons..this code is supposed to shuffle the 9 buttons in different positions..i just cant understand how this code works.
