"how can i change the standard out to ""utf-8"" in blank i download a file from a website using a blank program and the header looks like below..content-disposition attachment;filename=""textkürzung.asc"";...there is no encoding specified..what i do is after downloading i pass the name of the file to another application for further processing. i use..system.out.println(filename);...in the standard out the string is printed as textk³rzung.asc..how can i change the standard out to ""utf-8"" in blank?..i tried to encode to ""utf-8"" and the content is still the same..update: ..i was able to fix this without any code change. in the place where i call this my jar file from the other application, i did the following..blank -dfile.encoding=utf-8 -jar ......this seem to have fixed the issue..thank you all for your support"
