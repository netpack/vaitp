"how to add leading zeros to an int? if i input an int value, is it possible to keep a leading zero. for example if i input 0123, is there a way to pass that zero without formatting the data..i came across an exercise on a website which asks to enter an isbn number as an int and validate it. the initial code given is the following...import blank.util.scanner;..public class isbncheck {..    public static void main(string[] args) { .        int num= 0;.        int digit = 0;.        int sum = 0;..        system.out.println(""enter isbn number:"");.        scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);..        num = sc.nextint();..        /*.        your code here.        */..        system.out.println(""the isbn number is:"");.    }.}...the link to the website is http://www.programmr.com/challenges/isbn-validation-1..if i wanted to take the first digit of an input and do something with it, i cannot if the first integer is a 0. to test the code the input is 0201314525. however i lose the initial zero and then i cannot make the code work. i used a string input instead of an int which i can then manipulate to do what i want. is it possible to complete the code given the way it's being presented?"
