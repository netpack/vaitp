"how do i make a method loop every 7 days at the same time based on real time? pastebin.com/zgedmeaa i've got it to loop at a certain time. what i need to do now is make it so that when i start the script it will finish at 12am monday 4 weeks later. also; when i run my current script (pastebin link) the output is this: 1.001495e7, there is letters and that doesn't seem right. could you tell me why it doesn't show the 14.95% interest added onto the 100k?"
