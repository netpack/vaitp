"replacing a string in blank i am trying to replace the short form words to normal from a string in blank but don't know how to do it in a good way because i can have multiple ('ve 're 'nt) and such. is it good to use array list and if so how do i achieve that?..what i have tried so far:..public class main {.. public static void main(string[] args) {..  string s = ""we've been doing this for ages. i'm having a difficulty doing this. thats getting confusing."";.  s = s.replaceall(""we've"", ""we have"");.  s = s.replaceall(""i'm"", ""i am"");.  s = s.replaceall(""that's"", ""that is"");.. }.}...thanks!"
