"blank source bomb (like zip bomb) i found question about scala bomb (like a zip bomb)..and i'm interested the same question but about blank:...  is it possible to create a blank source file, that will, when compiled,.  produce a large number of class files (or a very large single class.  file)? is there any way the size of the class files could grow faster.  than linearly with the size of the source file?"
