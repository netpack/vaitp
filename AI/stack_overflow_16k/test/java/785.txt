"josephus game using blank i am currently having problems with my josephus code. ..the purpose of the code is to ask a user for 3 integers and then execute. ..for some sequence of numbers it works perfectly while other sequences it produces the wrong output. for example if i enter 7(size), 1(holder) 3(pass). i get the last integer as 3 when it is suppose to be 2. i am also having an issue with the size not starting at 1. ..for example if i define my size as 7, it is suppose to start at 1.2.3... but instead starts at 8.2.4.. ..i believe the problem lies with the deletelist method. since i notice that when the program reaches the sequence where the list is (2,3,5,7), it does not delete properly. i can't figure why it is deleting 3 instead of 5. ..       public void deletelist(int holder, int pass, int listsize){// method to determine which number gets deleted..          while(listsize!= 1){..          link current = find(holder, listsize);..          link previous = first;...          for(int i = 1; i &lt; pass; i++){.             current = current.next;..          }..          previous = current;     ..          current = current.next;...          if(current == first){.                  first = first.next;..          }.          else{..             previous.next = current.next;...          }.          holder = current.next.idata;.          displaylist(--listsize);.          }.       }"
