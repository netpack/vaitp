"blank text-based rpg - movement pattern for monsters so i have an rpg with monsters and rooms and i want to give monsters movement patterns so every x turns they move to a specified room and cycle back...so something like library -> lab -> home -> lab -> library...my first thought was that the monster class should have a static arraylist to keep track of the monsters, and then every monster has an arraylist for the rooms it cycles through. then on each turn if turn % x == 0 i move each monster into the next room on its arraylist of rooms. ..but i'm not sure what's the best way to keep track of where each monster is in its cycle, i could also add an iterator on the arraylist of rooms for each monster that increments every 4 turns until it reaches the end and resets and use that to get the next room to move to but i'm wondering if there's a simpler way to do this."
