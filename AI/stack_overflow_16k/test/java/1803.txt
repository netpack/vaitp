"implementing comparable interface produces ""unsupportedoperationexception : listiterator does not support set"" error what i'm trying to do is to sort an arraylist of objects by a property (integer) in blank...i've found several posting about using comparable/comparator for this perpose, but none of them seem to be related to ""blank.lang.unsupportedoperationexception"" error. so, i'm writing a question here...i followed this page, and have been trying to use comparable interface...here is part of my coding..public class word implements comparable&lt;word&gt;{..private string wordname;.private int number;.. // there are only simple constructers, getters and setters ..@override.public int compareto(word word) {.    int comparenumber = ((word) word).getnumber();.    return comparenumber - this.number;..    }.}...the main method is like this...public static void main(string[] args) {.    //there are some irrelevant methods and fields..    list newwordlist = new arraylist&lt;&gt;();..    for (string wordname : wordlist) {.        //wordlist is of list&lt;string&gt;, containing several ""wordname"" (i.e. string values)..        //get how many duplicate ""wordname"" inside the list.        int number = collections.frequency(wordlist, wordname);            .        word word = new word(wordname, number);.        newwordlist.add(word);.    }..    list noduplist = setuniquelist.setuniquelist(newwordlist);.    collections.sort(noduplist, new comparator&lt;word&gt;() {.        @override public int compare(word w1, word w2) {.            return w2.getnumber() - w1.getnumber();.        }.    });..}...then, this produces ""blank.lang.unsupportedoperationexception: listiterator does not support set""...i'm confused particularly about ""listiterator"", since i don't use this class nor do i use set class either...i would appreciate if you would give any insight."
