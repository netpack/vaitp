"searching string trouble in single array for blank i am new to programming and i decided to learn blank. i had just finished reading about one dimensional array and i am having trouble with searching...the summary of this program i had made is to ask the user how many students will be enrolled in the class. the user then inputs the name of the students based on the length of the array. then i want the to be able to have the user search for the students name. how can i accomplish this? what i want to accomplish is when the user inputs the first name it will return the list of full names that has the matching first name. i really struggling with this. please don't give any advanced methods. i would like to stay in pace pace with my book...i am using introduction to blank programming comprehensive version 10th edition...import blank.util.scanner;..public class classsystem    {..    public static void main(string[] args).    {.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        system.out.println(""weclome instructure to your class system!"");.        system.out.println(""follow each steps to turn in your work instructor."");.        system.out.println(""n1.) enroll students:"");..        system.out.print(""nhow many students are enrolled? "");.        int studentamount = input.nextint();..        string[] enrolledstudents = getstudentattendance(studentamount);..        system.out.println(""here is your attendance list:"");..        for (int count = 0; count &lt; enrolledstudents.length; count++) {.            system.out.print(""nt"" + (count + 1) +     "".) "" + enrolledstudents[count]);.        }..        system.out.print(""nnwhat sudent do you want to search: "");..        string studentsearch = input.nextline();..        system.out.println(getstudent(enrolledstudents, studentsearch));.    }..    public static string[] getstudentattendance(int studentamount).    {.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        string[] enrolledstudents = new string[studentamount];..        system.out.println(""input the students names:"");.        for (int count = 0; count &lt; enrolledstudents.length; count++).        {.            system.out.print((count + 1) + "".) "");.            enrolledstudents[count] = input.nextline();.        }..        return enrolledstudents;.    }..    public static string getstudent(string[] enrolledstudents, string studentsearch).    {.        for (int count = 0; count &lt; enrolledstudents.length; count++).        {.            if(studentsearch.equals(enrolledstudents[count])) .            {.                return getstudent;.            }.        }.    }..}"
