"what hack can i use to suppress an unused function warning? consider a private method which is called from jni and not used otherwise, generating a compiler warning about an unused method:..private void somemethodcalledonlyfromjni() { // warning: method is never used.    // .....}...this is some legacy code in blank 1.4 - so no dice on @suppresswarnings...what hack would you use to suppress this compiler warning?....edit: obviously this is just a warning and it can easily be ignored. but, personally, i hate warnings in my code just as much as i don't want to see errors in it. afaic - my code should have 0 warnings, it might be an exaggeration, but i am very pedantic about this...just as an example, someone might see this function, not know it is used from jni, and simply delete it."
