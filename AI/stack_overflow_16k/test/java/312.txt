"blank how to convert a blank.nio.buffer into a bytebuffer i'm facing a little problem i have two libraries one send me the output as blank.nio.buffer and the other receives the input as a blank.nio.bytebuffer how do i make the conversion?..thanks..the buffer is from blankcv from this piece of code:..private bytepointer[]   image_ptr;.private buffer[]        image_buf;..// determine required buffer size and allocate buffer.int size = avpicture_get_size(fmt, width, height);.image_ptr = new bytepointer[] { new bytepointer(av_malloc(size)).capacity(size) };.image_buf = new buffer[] { image_ptr[0].asbuffer() };..// assign appropriate parts of buffer to image planes in picture_rgb.// note that picture_rgb is an avframe, but avframe is a superset of avpicture.avpicture_fill(new avpicture(picture_rgb), image_ptr[0], fmt, width, height);.picture_rgb.format(fmt);.picture_rgb.width(width);.picture_rgb.height(height);"
