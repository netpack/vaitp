"prime problems blank a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1. in this assignment you are responsible to write a complete blank program to display first n prime numbers. in other words, your program should list the first n prime numbers...functional requirements..your program should prompt the user for a positive number, or a value of -1 to terminate the program. if the user enters 0, or a negative number, the program will also end immediately..your program will display the first n prime numbers given by the user. for example, if the user enters 3, the program should display: “2, 3, 5” which are the first three prime numbers. if the user enters 6, the output would be: “2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13”...sample run..welcome to the list of n prime numbers program!.===============================================.please enter the value of n (positive integer):.6..first 6 prime numbers are:.2.3.5.7.11.13...when i worked on it i got this but need help finishing..import blank.util.scanner;..public class prime {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        system.out.print(""welcome to the list of n prime numbers program! n========================================================nplease enter the value of n (positive integer): "");.        scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);.        int n;.        int status=1;.        int num=3;.        n = scan.nextint();.        if(n&gt;=1) {.            system.out.println(2);.            for(int count=2; count&lt;=n; count++) {.                for(int j=2; j&lt;=math.sqrt(num);j++) {.                    if(num%j==0) {.                        status =0;.                        break;.                    }.                    if(status!=0) {.                        system.out.println(num);.                        count++;.                    }.                }.                status=1;.                num++;.            }.        }.    }.}"
