"reading characters from txt file as nodes for search tree (artificial intelligence) this is a search tree problem (romania map may be taken as a refenrence). i'm trying to read chars from text file. this file has several lines and each line contains a parent-child relation (root node and child node) and a path cost between them. example is below:...  a b 5.  a c 3.  b d 6...should i use bufferedreader here in order to take these values and implement them into my code, or another reader should be used? if so, how can i split data char by char?..so far, i've used this code:..try{.    bufferedreader reader = new bufferedreader(.            new filereader(""tree.txt""));.    string line = """";.    while((line = reader.readline()) != null){.        //here i should import characters, split them by space .        //and use them as a root node, child node and cost value.    }.}catch(exception e){.    system.out.println(e);.}...actually nodes are:..    node j = new node(""j"",10);.    node k = new node(""k"",3);.    node l = new node(""l"",19);.    node m = new node(""m"",5);.    node n = new node(""n"",7);.    node o = new node(""o"",8);.    node p = new node(""p"",8);.    node q = new node(""q"",0);..    j.setchildren(new node[]{k,l,m});.    k.setchildren(new node[]{n,o,p,q});"
