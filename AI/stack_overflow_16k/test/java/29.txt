"downcasting in inheritance i understand that upcasting/downcasting in objects do not change the object, but rather change how we deal with them. ( or change the type of their reference if i understand correctly)...however, if we have an animal class that has a getname(); method, and a dog class which is a child class of animal...animal billy = new animal(""billy"",1);.dog b = (dog)billy;.b.getname();...i understand that it will compile, but give a run time error, my question is why, getname(); method is present in the animal class, and so it is inherited by the dog class, so it's present in both, what prevents us from having it done?"
