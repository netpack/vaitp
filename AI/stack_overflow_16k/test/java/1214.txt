"remove hashmap key from string i have mobile numbers in database table column, in a format of country_code followed by mobile_number.so mobile number format is like this,..+91123456789 // country code of india is +91 followed by mobile number.+97188888888 // country code of uae +971...i have one hashmap containing countrycodes of 5 countries like this,..map.put(""+91"",""india"").map.put(""+94"",""sri lanka"").map.put(""+881"",""bangladesh"").map.put(""+971"",""uae"").map.put(""+977"",""nepal"")...my bean structure is something like this..class userdetails {..  // other fields.   string countrycode;.   string mobilenumber;.}...now my task is to take the mobile number from database table column and split it in two parts and set countrycode and mobilenumber, but country code length(in map's key) varies between 3 and 4. this checking can be done by using substring() and equals() but i don't think it's correct way, so what would be the elegant(may be checking in map key) way to solve this issue?"
