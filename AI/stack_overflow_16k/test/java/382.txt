"why do the values of my hashes never match in blank? i have a .jsp which accepts password input.  it will not match the hash of a password inside the application, even though a test using attempt.equals(password) works prior to the hashing...i am passing the string thus:..passwordmanager.checkpassword(request.getparameter(""password""))...this is my hashing code:..byte[] password = p.getbytes(""utf-8"");.byte[] attempt = a.getbytes(""utf-8"");..passwordhash = digestutils.md5(password);.attempthash = digestutils.md5(attempt);...in addition, i have set the encoding in the .jsp:..&lt;fmt:requestencoding value=""utf-8"" /&gt;...however, the hashes remain stubbornly different.  any ideas?"
