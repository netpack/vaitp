"inconsistency in blank collection apis first of all, i am unable to find an interface for stack data structure. it exists, but the one i find extends a vector which i would try to avoid using. so, if you really need a stack, would you recommend me implementing my own stack class that has-a a arraydeque internally or would you recommend me using the stack class that extends the vector? i am very disappointed that a good stack interface is non-existent in blank...secondly, queue provides, add(e), remove() and element() methods. on top of that, they also provide offer(e), poll() and peek() methods. the former throws exception, while the latter returns true or false or null. which one would you use if the queue you want to use is for  a non-concurrent case?"
