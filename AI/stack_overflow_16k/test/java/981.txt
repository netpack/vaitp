"effecting the instance fields of one class with the instance fields of another i want to clarify beforehand that i am only interested in programming from a hobbyist perspective and have no education regarding programming nor do i have any professional experience. ..i am trying to figure out how to affect the instance fields of one class with the instance fields of another. here is an example of what i'm trying to figure out: ..//main class.class main.{.    public static void main(string[] args).    {..        class1 instance1 = new class1(1);.        class2 instance2 = new class2(1);..    }..    public void method1().    {.        // code to add the class1 instance field value class1num1 to class2 instance field value class2num1.        // at least cobine the two values in one variable that is usable in main.    }.}..//class1.class class1.{.    int class1num1;..    public class1(int num1).    {.        class1num1 = num1;.    }.}..//class2.class class2.{.    int class2num1;..    public class2(int num1).    {.        class2num1 = num1;.    }.}...ultimately i want to know how i could get class2num1 and add it to class1num1 in the main class. i mean want to change the value of class1num1 via a method so that later in my program when class1num1 is referenced, the value returned is 2 (class1num1 +class2num1). how would i write a method to do that and what class or classes would i have to write this in? this may be an incredibly simple task i realize but i can't seem to figure this out. ..based on responses it look as if getter and setter methods are the way to go however, based on the examples i have seen so far it looks as though instance1 and instance2 are having to be passed as arguments in the main class method that combines the two numbers. is there a way that i could write a method so that it targets the instance that calls the method? here is an example: ..//this method is being called in main.instance1.method(int class2){.    int a = getclass1num1(); .// ^ how could i target the instance calling this method here?.// .    int b = class2.getclass2num1();.    int c = a +b;.}"
