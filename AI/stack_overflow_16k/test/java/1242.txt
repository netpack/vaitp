"creating subclass of a class in blank edited version. i think my question was not clear. so, i have made some changes. i have a package named ""module 6"". under module 6, there are two separate classes named ""earthquakecitymap"" and ""commonmarker"". inside the earthquakecitymap class there are declaration for list, strings. for eg:.. public class earthquakecitymap {...private unfoldingmap map;..private list&lt;marker&gt; citymarkers;.private list&lt;marker&gt; quakemarkers;.private list&lt;marker&gt; countrymarkers;.private commonmarker lastselected;...   }...i understand the declaration ""list"" but could not understand ""private commonmarker lastselected""..i do not want to give you trouble. but if you could not understand this, here is the link for the entire source code .https://github.com/areszhao/unfoldingmaps/tree/master/src/module6..thank you"
