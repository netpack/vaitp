"how can i wait for a frame to perform an action before the code execute the next line? i want to initialize a graphical user interface (gui) for the user to input a form. after this is accomplished i want to open a new gui, but as soon as the first gui pops-up the next one is initialized to. ..is there any way to solve this without using waits and notifies?..here is an example of my code:..public static void main(string[] args) {.    new guiform(); .    // wait until the user inputs the complete form.    new guiwelcome();..}...it is really simple i woild like to keep it that way."
