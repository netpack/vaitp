"how to set the path and blank-home of jdk 1.5 when we are already using jdk 1.6? i'm using jdk 1.6 at the moment, but i need to use jdk 1.5 now. i have installed the jdk 1.5. i really don't have an idea to set the path. i tried by setting this in the environment variables:..blank_home = c:program filesblankjdk1.5.0.path = c:program filesblankjdk1.5.0bin...but still when i check the version in the command prompt it says jdk 1.6...how do i change it?"
