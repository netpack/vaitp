"is it bad practice in blank to modify input object in void method? in blank, assume you have a data object object with an attribute bar that you need to set with a value that is returned from a complex operation done in an external source. assume you have a method sendrequesttoexternalsource that send a request based on 'object' to the external source and gets an object back holding (among other things) the needed value...which one of these ways to set the value is the better practice?..void main(myobject object) {.    bar = sendrequesttoexternalsource(object);.    object.setbar(bar);.}..string sendrequesttoexternalsource(myobject object) {..    // send request to external source.    object response = posttoexternalsource(object);..    //do some validation and logic based on response.    .....    //return only the attribute we are interested in.    return response.getbar();.}...or..void main(myobject object) {.    sendrequesttoexternalsourceandupdateobject(object);.}..void sendrequesttoexternalsourceandupdateobject(myobject object) {..    // send request to external source.    object response = posttoexternalsource(object);..    //do some validation and logic based on response.    .....    //set the attribute on the input object.    object.setbar(response.getbar());.}...i know they both work, but what is the best practice?"
