"blank initializing object design lets say i have a object foo from class foo. lets say class foo has a lot of fields that characterize its offsprings. ..when having so many fields, is it preferred to initialize them all via the constructor of foo eg...foo foo = new foo(0, 12, 123, 2, 2, (and so on...));...or initialize them in the constructor or method from the class one will be using foo eg...foo foo = new foo();..public void initfoo() {.    foo.setx(1);.    foo.sety(3);.    foo.seth(3);.    (and so on...).}"
