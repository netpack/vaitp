"blank int array and char array implementation: why does this work? i am working on the kattis problem ""abc"" in a programming seminar class. the question asks you to input three ints between 0 and 100, and have them match the pattern of another group of three char inputs with the case: a &lt; b &lt; c. here 'a' will be int with least value, 'b' will be second greatest value, etc. i determined my logic but was unsure how to match values to char. then a fellow student gave me help with the last line but i didn't get a chance to ask about how it worked. code i have is as follows: ..public class abc {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        var scanner = new scanner(system.in);.        int[] num = new int[3];.        for (int i=0; i&lt;num.length; i++) {.            num[i] = scanner.nextint();.        }.        arrays.sort(num);.        char[] charr = scanner.next().tochararray();.        for (int i=0; i&lt;charr.length; i++) {.            system.out.println(num[charr[i] - 'a']); //how does num[charr[i] - 'a'] work?            .        }.    }.}...input: ...  1 2 3.  .  c a b...output:...  3 1 2...so, my question is: how does the expression in the println at the end work? i'm a noob to posting on so, so any suggestions would be gratefully accepted."
