"blank - how to add + 1 to variable every x seconds while not not stopping the program? i am a new programmer and i am making a console/text strategy game in blank...my program works like you are in while (true) switch case and you got options if you press 1 you collect wood, 2 for stones and like that, i would like to make it that your wood, stones, food gather automatically and i have no idea how to make it will welcome any help,..simplified code looks like this..  while (true) {.        scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.        string volbačlověk = in.nextline();..        switch (volbačlověk) {.            case ""1"":.                wood = wood + 1;.                break;.            case ""2"":.                stone = stone + 1;.                break;.            case ""3"":.                food = food + 1;.                break;.         }.     }...basically what i want to do is to make case 1,2,3 be done automatically every x seconds, so it works like you gather those materials automatically and in switch case there are building options...also since i am a newbie in programing, please be specific i will not be ashamed i have to learn it somehow."
