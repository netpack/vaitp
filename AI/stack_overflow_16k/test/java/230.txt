how to check if a parameter is present in a url in simplest form i would like to parse a string which is basically a url. i need to check simply that a parameters is passed to it or not. ..so http://a.b.c/?param=1 would return true http://a.b.c/?no=1 would return false and http://a.b.c/?a=1&amp;b=2.....&amp;param=2 would return true since param is set..i am guessing that it would involve some sort of regular expression.
