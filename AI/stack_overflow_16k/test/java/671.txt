"using a switch statement to count emoticons in a twitter search api? blank i have looked to see if anyone else has asked this question or if there is a similar type question, but i could not find any. ..i have created code to access the twitter search api. i am able to access twitter, and get back some tweets. .however i am supposed to create an application that counts emoticons. i have created a switch case statement, that lists all the emoticons that i want the search api to pass through and i want a count of them. and if it passes a emoticon and it is in the tweets, i want it to count it. .i have over a 100 emoticons, i have separated them in their own switch case statement. .how do i get count the emoticons the emoticons that may have showed up in the tweets?? in blank please. or can you please advise me on an alternative route. ..ok cool..here is my twitter search api code: ..  public class searchingtwitter {.public static void main(string[] args) throws ioexception {.    bufferedreader in = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(system.in));.    string urlstr = ""http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q="";.    // that is the twitter search api, i can request a search query and get tweets related to query.    stringbuffer buff = new stringbuffer();.    system.out.print(""search for : ""); // this is where you input what you want the tweets on.    urlstr += in.readline();.    url url = new url(urlstr);.    bufferedreader br = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(url.openconnection().getinputstream()));.    // opens a connection to twitter and gets the tweets.    int c;.    while ((c=br.read()) !=-1) { // stores the tweets.        buff.append((char)c); .    }br.close();    ..    jsonobject js = new jsonobject(buff.tostring()); //converts whatever is buffered from twitter to string.    jsonarray tweets = js.getjsonarray(""results"");.    // results = array, represents a single tweet and all the information regarding that tweet.            jsonobject tweet;.    for(int i=0;i&lt;tweets.length();i++) {.        tweet = tweets.getjsonobject(i);.        system.out.println((i+5)+"") ""+tweet.getstring(""from_user"") // username of tweeter.                +"" at ""+tweet.getstring(""created_at"")); // time tweet written/created.        system.out.println(tweets.getjsonobject(i).getstring(""text"")+""n""); // prints out the tweet texts, one on a new line everytime.}...how do i call the happiness class? so that it can look through and count please. ..thanks for helping me! this was for my dissertation."
