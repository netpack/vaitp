"problems with if-else statements and operators so, for my homework, i have to make a program that allows the user to enter in the highest amount of money they are willing to pay for a house as a whole number. here's the catch; i have to use if-else statements and joptionpane dialog boxes...so i came up with this code:..import blankx.swing.joptionpane;..public class housingdecision {  ..    public static void main(string[] args) {.         //listed things that need to be identified.         int housemoney;.         string input;.         input = joptionpane. showinputdialog(""how much money do you have?"");.         //making the input be listed by the user.         housemoney = integer. parseint(input);.         //set up so that if its more than the parameters, itll move on to the next if else statement.         if (housemoney &gt;= 250000 &amp;&amp; housemoney &lt;= 100000 );.         { .             input = ""you can afford a townhouse!"";.         }.         if(housemoney &gt;= 250001 &amp;&amp; housemoney &lt;= 400000);.         {.         input = ""you can afford a single family house!"";.         }..         if (housemoney &gt;= 400001 &amp;&amp; housemoney &lt;= 800000);.         {.        input = ""you can afford a luxury house!"";.         }.         if (housemoney &gt;= 800001);.         {.        input = ""wow! you can afford a mansion!"";.         }          .    }.}...however, it does not run when a whole number is input. what do i need to change so this isn't a problem anymore?"
