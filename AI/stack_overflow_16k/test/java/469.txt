"method that takes in two predicates and returns a predicate predicate&lt;t&gt; and(predicate&lt;t&gt; p1, predicate&lt;t&gt; p2) {.}...i would like to create the above method which creates another predicate that evaluates to true if the predicates p1 and p2 both evaluate to true...i would know how to do this if the return type was of boolean but i am unable to think of how to create another predicate that would resolve this... i have already tried to play around with the andthen method and the test method...any help would be greatly appreciated!"
