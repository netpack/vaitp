"difference between using same socket or different sockets for multiple connection i am facing a problem regarding designing my app with datagram socket. my app needs to communicate with different servers using udp connections. now i am not sure which of the following will be good. is there any advantage of any of the following ( by performance or by other measures ). or is there any better option?..option 1..create a single datagram socket, and create a single thread to receive data of that. while sending to different servers set the address of the datagram packets. and in the receiving thread check the address and process data accordingly..option 2..create different datagram sockets to communicate with servers. use socket.connet() to connect to the relevant server. and create threads for every socket to receive data...n.b. i am actually working on an android app. if you have any query you can ask in comment"
