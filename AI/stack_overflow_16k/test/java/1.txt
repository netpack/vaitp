"what is the difference between text and string? in going through the blankfx tutorial i've run into the text, and it's being used where i would have thought a string would be used. is the only difference between..string foo = new string(""bat"");...and..text bar = new text(""bat"");...that bar cannot be edited, or are there other differences that i haven't been able to find in my research?"
