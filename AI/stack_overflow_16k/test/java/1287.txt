"blank file io scan into variables this is basically my first true blank assignment and i've hit a brick wall. i basically wrote my entire project as if the user were to input the information into the program. upon rereading the assignment i saw that we are to input the info from a .txt file in the following format:..1.17 12 15( and then sort them)...7 54 9873 1867 4425 878 365 783 (where the first number n indicates how many n will folow).4 (flyods triangle problem).20 (fizz buzz problem)...i have all of the code written to solve these parts of the project but am completely stuck on how to implement the numbers from the .txt file. i am not asking for code merely some advice on how you guys might go about doing so/..import blank.util.arrays;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class funtime {.public static void main(string args[]).{.int n, num = 1, c, d;.scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.n = in.nextint();..for ( c = 1 ; c &lt;= n ; c++ ).{.for ( d = 1 ; d &lt;= c ; d++ ).{.system.out.print(num+"" "");.num++;.}..system.out.println();.}"
