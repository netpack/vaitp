"blank and final initialization i'm ""converting"" from .net to blank. i wonder why a code below is not working..class myclass{.  private final int intvar;  //ok.  private final paint paint; //error ""variable paint might not have been initialized""..  public myclass(){.       intvar = 12; .       initializepaint(); .  }..  private void initializepaint(){.       paint = new paint();  //error  ""cannot assign a variable to final variable"".  }..}"
