"repeat same method and using new value of one parameter i'm trapped within this certain predicament of mine and i would gladly accept any suggestion. so here it is:..i'm currently working in a method where a certain variable is assigned a specific value in the beginning part of the method. during the course of the method, that variable is used as a parameter by an external component which basically returns a result code. in one of those result codes, i have to change the value of the prior mentioned variable and repeat the whole process using the new value. the concept is as follows but i have simplified it as much as possible:..public void mymethod (string args[]) {.    string server;..    server = ""some value"";..    switch (someexternaloperation(server)) {.    case 1:.        //process.....        break;.    case 2:.        server = ""new value"";.        //repeat mymethod using new value of server string variable.        break;.    }.}..public int someexternaloperation (string str) {.    //after several operation.    return 1; //example purposes.}...by the way, i have checked and researched things like goto and other alternative. i may have overlooked some results and ended up asking here. any help would be much appreciated. thank you."
