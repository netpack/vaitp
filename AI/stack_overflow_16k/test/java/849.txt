"passing several arguments to single parameterized method with ""|""? i did some android stuff and found strange blank code snippet...i checked following with j2se and it gives commented results(without ""prints"")...blank code snippet looked like following:..class a{.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        method(1 | 2); //prints 3.        method(1 | 2 | 3); //prints 3.        method(1 | 2 | 3 | 4);//prints 7.    }..    public static void method(int value) {.        system.out.println(value);.    }.}...my question is what is happening here?"
