"is it blank error? when i try to execute a blank application, i get an error ...'could not find _jni_getentrypoints@0 in dynamic library xx.dll...i want to know if it is a generic blank related error (such as some problem with blank installation on my windows computer?) or it is specific error related to the application only. if it is installation error, what kind of files/libraries i should install? thanks."
