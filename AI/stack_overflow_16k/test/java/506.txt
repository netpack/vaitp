"is default package included in the package level access? i would like to know how the default package is defined in blank.i know how public and private access is defined but i don't know whether there is any default package access that is defined in package level access in blank...the code i tried to execute is:..  class a.  {.    public static void value().    {.    int a;.    a=5;.    }.    public static void main().    {.    value();.    }.  }.  class b.  {.    public void greet().    {.    system.out.println(""value of a is""+a);.    }.  }...the error i got is:..d:downloadspro&gt;blankc a.blank.a.blank:17: error: cannot find symbol.system.out.println(""value of a is""+a);.                                   ^.  symbol:   variable a.  location: class b.1 error...since both classes belong to the same default package shouldn't class b access class a's members(a)?..i'm asking this question because when i compile blank file containing two classes since no modifier is given for classes,blank compiler would give package level access as the default access modifier for the classes.since no package is defined,blank compiler would use the default package but i couldn't get whether the default package is included in package level access in blank.could anyone help me."
