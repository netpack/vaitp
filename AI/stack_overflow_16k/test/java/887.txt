"how to do goto in blank? i'm trying to make a game like family feud where the user gets asked a question and they have to reply 3 times so i was wondering if there was something like goto that i could use...question question = questions.get(new random().nextint(questions.size()));.system.out.println(question.getquestion());.scanner scanner = new scanner(system.in);..//want to put start right here but can't.//start:..string answer = scanner.nextline();..for (answer a : question.getanswers()).{.    if (a.getanswer().tolowercase().contains(answer)).    {.        system.out.println(a.getanswer() + "" "" + a.getpoints());.        return;.        //make it go back to start right here.    }.}..system.out.println(""wrong!"");.//also make it go back to start right here"
