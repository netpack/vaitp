"how to maintain the division value without changing the output resolution when you add a number to a division product, the precision changes and the output becomes inaccurate.example:.1/(0.2352941176470588235294117647058823530)=4.2499999999999999999999999999999999989.but the output gave me an approximate value.2.25.i want the value not to change and remain without a round..thank you"
