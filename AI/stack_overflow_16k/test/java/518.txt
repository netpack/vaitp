"blank do while guessing game so for an assignment i had to do last week i had to make a guessing game in blank using 4 do-while loops and if statements. i was unable to complete it successfully and the class has moved on providing me no help. i would appreciate it if someone could look at my code and tell me where i could improve it so the program works properly. ..to give a brief description of the assignment, the assignment calls for 4 do-while loops:...the primary do-while loop which contains most of the code and keeps.the program running until the user wants to quit.the game do-while loop which keeps the game running until the user.guesses the correct number, at which point it will exit. (this part.i could not figure out)..a numeric input validation do-while loop inside of the game loop,.which makes sure the user's guess is valid..a non-numeric input validation do-while loop which is after and.outside of the game loop that asks the user if they want to play.again, and checks for a valid 'y' or 'n' response...here is what i came up with:..package week4;..//imports.import blank.lang.math;.import blank.util.scanner;...public class lab4d {.    public static void main(string[] args) {..        //set up scanners.        scanner again = new scanner(system.in);.        scanner num1 = new scanner(system.in);..        //set up variables.        int userinput = 0;.        int guesses = 0;.        int min = 1;.        int max = 100;.        int range = max - min + 1;.        int randnum = (int)(math.random() * range) + min;.        boolean valid = false;..        //outside loop.        do{.            //describe the game.            system.out.println(""nthis program is a guessing game."");.            system.out.println(""nthe computer will pick a random number "".                               + ""between 1 and 100."");.            system.out.println(""nyou will try to guess it."");.            system.out.println(""nlet's play!"");..            //insert game loop here.            do {.                system.out.println(""ni'm thinking of a number "" +.                                   ""between 1 and 100."");.                //insert valid guess checker here.                do {.                    system.out.println(""please enter your guess: "");.                    if (num1.hasnextint()){.                        userinput = num1.nextint();.                        valid = true;.                    }.                    else {.                        system.out.println(""error: please enter a whole number.n"");.                        num1.nextline();.                    }.                }while(!valid);..                if (userinput &gt; randnum) {.                    system.out.println(""ntoo high!"");.                    guesses++;.                }.                else if (userinput &lt; randnum) {.                    system.out.println(""ntoo low!"");.                    guesses++;.                }.                else if (userinput == randnum) {.                    system.out.println(""you got it!"");.                    system.out.println(""it took you"" + guesses + ""tries"");.                    valid = true;.                }.            }while(!valid);...            //insert play again checker.            do {.                system.out.println(""ndo you want to play again?"");.                system.out.println(""nenter 'y' if yes and 'n' if no."");.                string play = again.nextline();.                if (play.equalsignorecase(""y"")) {.                    valid = true;.                }.                else if (play.equalsignorecase(""n"")) {.                    valid = true;.                }..                else {.                    system.out.println(""error: please answer with 'y' or 'n'"");.                }.            }while(!valid);..        }while(!valid);.    }.}...i appreciate the help!"
