"how to make a blank program run on remote machine such that its logged messages are made available to me i want to run a blank program on a remote machine...also, i want all of the log messages which are logged by that program, to be available to me in another machine. a plus would be if i could filter/receive messages of a certain type, eg debug messages/ error messages only...is this possible? i dont want to change the code of the program that will actually be run on the remote machine."
