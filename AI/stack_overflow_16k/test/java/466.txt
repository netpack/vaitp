"blank, close filewriter changes file md5 value i need to create a md5 file after creating a file with some contents...but i find a problem that the md5 value of the file is different from the actual file value though i don't change the file itself. ..at last i find that if i create the md5 file inside the try-with-resources block, the md5 changes. i wrote below code snippet to verify what i guess..public static void main(string[] args) throws ioexception {.    string filepath = ""d:\push\file\imei2device\imei2device.txt"";.    file f = new file(filepath);.    try (filewriter fw = new filewriter(f);){.        fw.write(""something"");.        //createmd5file(filepath);// create here, not ok!..    }.    catch (exception ex) {.        ex.printstacktrace();.    }.    createmd5file(filepath);// create here, ok.    logger.info(""create md5 file successfully, notmodified: {}"", mappedfilereader.isfilenotmodified(filepath));.}...when i put createmd5file in two different place , i will find a md5 value is different...i suspect that the file itself is different when the filewriter is close, like the eof?"
