"blank, importing a userinput i'm currently in an entry blank class and my instructor has asked us to make a program. he has provided us with 3 io classes to input into netbeans to fix some of the errors. this program is asking us to enter an employee's information and output that info to a file. when i do i get the cannot find symbol error. i placed the keyboard class in the userinputs folder and that works fine. i'm having issues with the outputfile. if i don't place the import at the top of the screen i get the errors on the first two lines under the main method. when i place the import at the top of the program like shown, those two errors go away but then i get the error on the import line of code. again i'm very entry level, so my code at the bottom might be off but i have not been able to test it because of these errors. any help would be great, thanks!..package practice;.import userinputs.keyboard;      .import blankx.swing.joptionpane;.import userinputs.outputfile;../**. *. * @author hitztp. */.public class practice .{..    /**.     * @param args the command line arguments.     */.    public static void main(string[] args) .    {.        outputfile payrollfile;.        payrollfile = new outputfile(""payroll.txt"");.        keyboard k;.        k = new keyboard();.        string name, answer;.        double payrate, hours;..        do.        {.        joptionpane.showinputdialog(""please enter employee's full name."");.        name = k.readstring();.        joptionpane.showinputdialog(""please enter employee's payrate."");.        payrate = k.readdouble();.        joptionpane.showinputdialog(""please enter employee's hours worked."");.        hours = k.readdouble();.        payrollfile.writestring(name);.        payrollfile.writedouble(payrate);.        payrollfile.writedouble(hours);..        joptionpane.showinputdialog(""would you like to enter another employee?
