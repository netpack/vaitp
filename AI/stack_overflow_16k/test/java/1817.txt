"checkdate,cheking days and month in 2019 i have a task that i should write a program that the user writes.a month and a day. then the program should print about t if it.is a valid day of the year. we assume the year is 2019, which.is not a leap year. for example, if the user writes month: 3 and.day: 21, then this is a valid day, but if the user specifies.month: 2 and day: 30, this is not a valid day because 30th.february is not a valid date..i should use array but i don't know how to use it :/    ..public class main {                                                     ..    public static void main(string[] args) {                            .           int daysinmonth[] = {31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31};   .           int monthinyear [] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,,7,8,9,10,11,12};           .           int i=0;                                                       .           for(i=0;i&lt;""month""-1;i++);                                                                                                                                                                   .         }                                                                                                                                   .      }"
