append part of blank byte array to stringbuilder how do i append a portion of byte array to a stringbuilder object under blank?  i have a segment of a function that reads from an inputstream into a byte array.  i then want to append whatever i read into a stringbuilder object:..byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];.inputstream is;.//.//some setup code.//.while (is.available() &gt; 0).{.   int len = is.read(buffer);.   //i want to append buffer[0] to buffer[len] into stringbuilder at this point. }
