"write to a file in blank how can i modify this run method to not only print the srting in the output window, but also write to a file for example outfile.txt in project directory. also each string should be on a separate line in the file...so i have already created a file in the project directory called outfile.txt..a the moment the code is print fine on window but not printing in the text file..here is the code #..public void run() throws ioexception.{.    scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);.    boolean cont = true;.    while (cont) {.       system.out.println(""enter text"");.       string s = sc.nextline();.       if (""*"".equals(s)) {.           cont = false;.       } else {.           string result = shorthand(s);.           system.out.println(result);.           printwriter pw = new printwriter(""outfile.txt"");.           pw.println(result);.      }.   }.}"
