"two methods running at the same time i basically have a mobile phone made in the app called bluej. it enters a duration of the phone call and you insert credit. every minute is equal to a pound. so basically if i insert 5 pounds and 6 minutes, it will do 6-5...in this case, it isn't working...the credit is successful, but as the credit changes, the duration minuses from the new credit, and not the one that was entered...is there a way around this or a way to run it at the same time, or for the old values before they change?..the issue is where it says:..    credit = credit - duration;.    duration = duration - credit;...many thanks...   public void makephonecall().    {.        if(credit == 0).        system.out.println(""insert more than 0 credit to make a phone call!"");.    else {.        if(credit &gt;= duration) {.        system.out.println(""the phone number "" + number + "" is being dialed for    "" + duration + "" minutes"");.        credit = credit - duration;.        duration = duration - credit;.    }.    else {.        if(credit &lt; duration).        system.out.println(""you do not have enough credit to make a phone call! your credit is "" + credit + "" pounds"");.    }.    }"
