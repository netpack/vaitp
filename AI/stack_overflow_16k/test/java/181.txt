"threadpool/executor with max working threads at a same time does blank have a thread pool that will limit maximum number of concurrently executing tasks not including tasks that are waiting for io or waiting for notification on object.wait()?..if no, is it possible to write it by myself, to allow only specified number of threads to run and when one waits for io, start another task and when io will be possible, thread will be allowed to run only when other completed."
