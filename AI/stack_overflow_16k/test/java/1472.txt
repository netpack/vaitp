question about adding three digits with each other in blank i have a task to add each numbers. one of my colleague helped me out and here's the code...public class solution {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        system.out.println(sumdigitsinnumber(546));.    }..    public static int sumdigitsinnumber(int number) {.        int sum = 0;..        sum = sum + number%10;.        number = number/10;..        sum = sum + number%10;.        number = number/10;..        sum = sum + number%10;.        number = number/10;..        return sum;//write your code here.    }...i'm not sure exactly how this works. can someone please explain to me? thanks.
