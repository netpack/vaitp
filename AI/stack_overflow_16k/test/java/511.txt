"why does writebytes discard each character's high eight bits? i wanted to use dataoutputstream#writebytes, but was running into errors. description of writebytes(string) from the blank documentation:...  writes out the string to the underlying output stream as a sequence of bytes. each character in the string is written out, in sequence, by discarding its high eight bits....i think the problem i'm running into is due to the part about ""discarding its high eight bits"". what does that mean, and why does it work that way?"
