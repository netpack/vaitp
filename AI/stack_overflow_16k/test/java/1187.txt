"blank: how many integers can a byte represent? 1 or 0 is one bit. a byte is 8 bits...why a byte can represent any integer from -128 to 127, inclusive, but not from 0 to 255?..because 11,111,111 in binary is 255,  and you include 0, thats 256 integers you can represent in a byte...also, my book auhor just tells me it's 256 because 2 to 8th power. ok, it makes sense, but how? what's the math?"
