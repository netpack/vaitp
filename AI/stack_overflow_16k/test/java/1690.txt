how to have int input correlate to a substring? i am trying to write a program that takes input from a user. the enter a number 1-12 and it returns the month january-december. i have to have all the months in one long string and then use a substring to return the corresponding month...i am very confused as to how to get an int to correlate to a substring. i would appreciate some general guidelines for doing this. i'm not looking to have the whole program done for me.
