"blank finding elements in array i have five arrays where i store incoming int numbers like:..int array1 = {1,6,..}.int array2 = {2,7,..}.....int array5 = {5,10,..}...now, what i have to do, search for next numbers in another arrays...like, ..for(i = 0, i &lt; array1.size ; i++){..int element = array1[0] ;..//here array2, array3, ..., array5 can have different size.search for array2 to find element+1.search for array3 to find element+2.....search for array5 to find element+5.}...what i am doing right now is:..run for loop for 0 to array2 size, to find element+1 (so for others)...however, it is quite slow. can anybody give me some idea, how to make it faster (i can change array to any-other data-structure also)...sorry, i make two mistakes while asking, what i should mention:..1) arrays are sorted (incremental elements always)..2) array elements are very few (2-3) so binary search will be expensive..3) i have to perform the search for thousand times means when channel input pause, i have to perform search, then again channel start and i have to perform search ... so on."
