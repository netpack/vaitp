"blank: calculating perfomance per second i have a thread pool that performs some heavy operations concurrently, the following is my code  ..examplecompute.blank..class examplecompute {.   private list&lt;long&gt; alldata = new arraylist&lt;long&gt;();.   executorservice executor = executors.newfixedthreadpool(1000);..   public calculate() {.      for(int i=0; i&lt;mydata.size; i++) {.        myworker worker = new myworker(mydata.get(i));.        future&lt;long&gt; currentdatapoint = executor.submit(worker);.        alldata.add(currentdatapoint);.      }..      executor.shutdown();.      while (!executor.isterminated()) {.      }.   }.}...what i am attempting to do is print to the screen how many operations are finishing per second every n seconds...for example..// every 10 seconds do the following.system.out.println(""thread pool is completing 533 calculation per second"");...what would be the best way to implement this?"
