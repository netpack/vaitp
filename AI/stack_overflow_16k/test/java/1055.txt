"adding letters to the top of a game board printed with nested for loops i created a class with the intention of using it to print an 8 by 8 game board to the screen for othello an othello game. i have the game board printing with letters down the side, however i can't figure out in my head how print letters above the top line of the board...here's the class code so far: ..public class createboard {.public char[][] board;..public createboard(){.    board = new char[8][8];..}..public void printboard(){..    for(int i = 0; i &lt; board.length; i++){.        for(int j = 0; j &lt; board.length; j++){.            board[i][j] = '-';  .        }.    }..    for(int i = 0; i &lt; board.length; i++){.        system.out.println();.        for(int j = 0; j &lt; board.length; j++){.            if(j == 0){.                system.out.print(i + 1);.                system.out.print(""| "");.            }.            system.out.print(board[i][j] + "" | "");  .        }.    }.}...so, what would be the correct way to implement numbers above the top row? thanks in advance. ..here's how the output currently is:....here's how i'd like it to look:"
