"using a interface type to instantiate a class object that implements the interface some confusion with using a interface as a type to instantiate a class object. why do we need the interface as a type? when we can use the class instead? as the class implements the interface anyway. i know you cannot instantiate an interface...many thanks for any suggestions,..   public interface sortrecords {.        int query(int rowid);.    }..    public class ourprice implements sortrecords {.        @override.        public int query(int rowid) {.            return 0;.        }.    }..    public void test() {.        /* .         * why has the interface as the type? .         */.        sortrecords sorterv1 = new ourprice();.        sorterv1.query(1);..        /* .         * why not just do like this? .         */.        ourprice sorterv2 = new ourprice();.        sorterv2.query(2);.    }"
