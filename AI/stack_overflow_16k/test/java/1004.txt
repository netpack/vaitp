"how to retrieve data from remote server faster in blank? i have a enhanced for loop that enters ch.ethz.ssh2.connection to obtain over 200 values. every time it goes into the loop a new server is being authenicated and it only retrieves one value from that server. each time it's looped the data are being saved into an arraylist to be displayed in html tables using thymeleaf. but this method takes forever for eclipse to run through all 200 values one at a time, then it have to restart when i open up localhost:8080 to load up all the tables with all the data. it takes over 5 mins to load the page up. what can i do to speed things up?..problem in code..list&lt;dartmodel&gt; data = new arraylist&lt;dartmodel&gt;();.for(string server:serverarray) {    ..    try {..        conn = new ch.ethz.ssh2.connection(server);.        conn.connect();.        boolean isauthenticated = conn.                .authenticatewithpassword(username_array[j],.                        password_array[j]);.        if (isauthenticated == false) {.            throw new ioexception(""authentication failed."");.        }...i need to somehow recode the code above so i can obtain the data all in super quickly...output..loop1: server1.loop2: differentserver2.loop3: alldifferentsever3.and goes on.........alternative..i was thinking to let the blank program run several times while saving the data into redis. then auto refresh the program, when it runs it sends the data into redis. set an expiration time, but i was unable to get the data into thymeleaf html tables. would this work? if so how can i display this into thymeleaf."
