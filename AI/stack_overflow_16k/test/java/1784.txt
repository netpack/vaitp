"how to go back to the first line of a file without re-instantiating bufferedreader?         for(string column: columnheaders){..            loadfile(); // here bufferedreader gets instantiated..            string header =getlinereader().readline();..            if(header!=null).            {.                while (( line=getlinereader().readline())!=null ).                {.                    cellvalue =statutils.getcellvalue(line,getcolumnnumberbyname(column));..                    csvcolumn.addrowelement(cellvalue,null);                        .                }                   ..            }   ..            closestreams(); // closing the reader.        }...for every column i need to read the csv-file from the 1st to last..the text file can be very big(100 columns and 5000000 rows)...now, createing a bufferedreader instance for each column - .1) is it going to hamper the performance?.2) is there any way to create reader once and whenever it reaches to the last line, in next iteration, it will start from the beginning......as i said, the file could be very big, so, i don't want to cache it into memory...any suggestion/comments?..thanks in advance."
