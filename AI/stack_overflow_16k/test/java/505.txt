"create an item and bag handler for a text-based rpg for practice, i'm creating a text-based rpg using blank. i'm currently using .properties files to handle character info. i understand that yaml might be a better option, but i'm not quite sure how to implement it. using properties, it would be easy to create an inventory handler (slot1, slot2, etc.), but creating items and reading the slots for item ids is a little beyond me...could i get some assistance?..to further elaborate, i'd like to create a system with three types of items: items to be used on the environment, items to be held in hand (like weapons or shields), and items to be worn."
