"store tokens in method to use in another method (no array use) sorry if there is a obvious answer and i'm not seeing it but i'm new to programming. i'm trying to use tokens from a .txt file as variables in a method but originally declared in another method. an example of line of code from txt file is:..lisa 0 0 0 0 464 38 1 6 31 113 298 ..my code gathers data from the user and locates that name from text file and uses its data. the code that i need from the text file is the integers only...public static void name(string n, scanner name){.      while(name.hasnextline()){.         string name2 = name.next();.         if(name2.equalsignorecase(n)){.            system.out.println(""popularity ranking of name """" +name2+ """""");.            int num1=0;.            for(int i = 0; i&lt;ls; i++){.               system.out.println(((i*10)+year)+ "": "" + num1);.               num1=name.nextint();                     //where the tokens i need are.                                                        //serving as attention getter.            }.         }.      }.      system.out.println(""name not found"");..   }..   public static void intro(){.      system.out.println(""this program graphs the popularity of a name"");.      system.out.println(""in social security baby name statistics"");.      system.out.println(""recorded since the year 1900."");.      scanner console=new scanner(system.in);.      system.out.println(""type a name: "");.      string n = console.next();.      name(n,name);.      graphdata(name);.   }.}...the place where i'm trying to use the tokens is the following:..public static void graphdata(scanner name){.    while(name.hasnextline()){.         int num=name.nextint();.         for(int i = 0;i&lt;ls;i++){.               g.drawstring("""" + num,i*width,30+(num/2));  //part specifically .               num.nextint();                              //where im trying to use the tokens.         }.     }. }...this is not the complete program, only what i feel is necessary. note that there are four class constants (year, name, ls, and width). they cannot be changed and i cannot use arrays in this program. .any thoughts on how i can go about doing it? .i've been looking everywhere but can't find anything. i've also tried a couple of things such as rewriting were the tokens were in names() and applying it to graphdata()."
