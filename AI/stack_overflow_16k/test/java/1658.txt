i dont understand why this code has an error im working on a code for homework to make a string upper case but without using touppercase specifically. so im using touppercase(char) then using a for loop to go through the string one by one. for some reason it error's. by the way str is defined by my teacher but it is random...int len = str.length();..for(int i = 0;i &lt; len;i++)..{..    char cur = str.charat(i);..    char cur = character.touppercase(char);..}...i dont see the error
