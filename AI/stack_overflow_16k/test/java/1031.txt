"where to initialize a derived field? i have a class x with x1, x2, etc. as its fields. i need to define a key for class x (which uniquely identifies an instance of class x). so i created a class key with the fields subset of class x. an instance of class key will be a field of class x. what is the best place to initialize the key?..public class x {.   int x1;.   int x2;.   int x3;.   key key;.}..public class key {.   int x1;.   int x3;.}...i have override equals and hashcode methods which should work based on key."
