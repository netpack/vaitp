"power of power to calculate in blank i have a program to write. the requirement is 1.    implement code (choose your favorite language) which will calculate the value of 2^(3^(4^(5^6))) ..what i have written is this so far ( for 4^(5^6).however, i get 0 as output despite the fact i have even changed the second argument from integer to long.a little help is needed.here is my code: ..public static void main(string args[]) {.    int i=4,j=5,k=6;.    system.out.println(pow(i,pow(j,k)));.}..public static long pow(int c, long l){       .    long n=1;.    for(int i=0;i&lt;l;i++){.        n=c*n;.    }.    return n;            .}"
