"getting a compile error- basic blank applet public class shippingapplet extends applet implements itemlistener...this gets me an error that says : ..documentsblank assignmentschap4 commissionshippingapplet.blank:14: error: shippingapplet is not abstract and does not override abstract method itemstatechanged(itemevent) in itemlistener...public class shippingapplet extends applet implements itemlistener..and i'm unsure what to do. previously in all my other chapters, i just simply put what the name of the file is (""shippingapplet"" in this case) and i'm fine. ..the program  you build during the chapter uses commissionapplet and i can change it, and it works fine, as long as it matches the file name. just unsure why i can't compile a stub here to see/test my layout."
