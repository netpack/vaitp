"when to use jaf activation i wonder if i should use it, in this example. i'm reading files, and i need to store one parameter with that file. ..according to this parameter i'm bundling files together and sending them over the wire...i came accross jaf activation framework, and i'm not sure if it is appropriate to use it in such simple example.(store 'file' into datahandler with this parameter or to make me simple holder). of course i don't know if requirments can change in the future, and i will need more. ..what do you think about it? ..my impression is that it's too much, it's difficult to get proper sources. but on the other hand it has what i need...the question could be more general as well, should i use framework which can do a lot more, if i need something really simple and i can code it quickly?..thanks in advance"
