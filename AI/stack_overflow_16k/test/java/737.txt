"difference in two coding snippets i am practicing blank using codingbat blank. i am currently working on this problem here: ...  we have a loud talking parrot. the ""hour"" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. we are in trouble if the parrot is.  talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. return true if we are in.  trouble...parrottrouble(true, 6) → true.parrottrouble(true, 7) → false.parrottrouble(false, 6) → false....my code that i put in is different than the expected answer. but as i look at the expected answer, i am trying to figure out why my answer is not acceptable. it is a trivial question, but i am rusty in blank. can anyone care to take a look and tell me why my answer is not accepted or if their is a problem with the code that i am not catching?..my code:..public boolean parrottrouble(boolean talking, int hour) {.  for (hour = 0; hour &lt;= 23; hour++).  {.     if(hour &lt; 7 || hour &gt; 20).     {.        talking = true;.     }.     else.     {.        return false;.     }.  }.  return talking;.}...expected answer:..public boolean parrottrouble(boolean talking, int hour) {.  return (talking &amp;&amp; (hour &lt; 7 || hour &gt; 20));.  // need extra parenthesis around the || clause.  // since &amp;&amp; binds more tightly than ||.  // &amp;&amp; is like arithmetic *, || is like arithmetic +.}"
