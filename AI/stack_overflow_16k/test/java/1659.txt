"@override not supported for constructors i know constructors are not inheritable in blank, we need to use super() - super must be the first statement in constructors. ..but why cant i use @override annotation?..in example:..public class foo extends point2d.double {.    @override // the annotation @override is disallowed for this location.    public foo(){}.}...if i have a instance of foo, i never ever can call point2d.double.double() directly! this behave is compleatly like overriding!"
