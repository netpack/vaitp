"referencing user input string from another class? i'm trying to write a program that asks the user for input using the scanner class to name something. then in a completely different class, reference that input. ..for example:..class teaminfo {.    scanner nscan = new scanner(system.in);..public string getname(){.    string getname = nscan.nextline();..}...the issue i'm having is that the first time i reference the getname method in the teaminfo class, it works--at the right spot, it prompts for the team name. ..however, it prompts for the team name every time after that. i can't seem to find anywhere online or in my blank beginner's guide how to make this input constant, so that i can reference the input. i'm also not entirely sure what it is i'm looking for, so that doesn't help. ..in other words, what i want is to prompt the user one time, and then remember that answer and re-use it again and again."
