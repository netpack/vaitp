"problem with math.log and math.pow expression so i have this homework question where it asks me to make a power formula using  e^(y * log(x)) and my pow method. i have done my pow method and it works, just having some difficulty with the equation method. ..for example, if i put in 7 and 5..i should get the answer 16806.9999999 for the expression and for my pow 16806. i'm not getting that answer for the expression...double one;.double two;..system.out.println(""enter your first number"");.one = sc.nextdouble();..system.out.println(""entr your second number"");.two = sc.nextdouble();.sc.close(); ..system.out.println(""using the formula your number is "" + math.log(math.pow(one, 1) * math.log(two)));.system.out.println(""using mypow "" + math.pow(one, two));"
