"incrementing values of a given string i have a string as follows:..abc=1,def=2,ghi=1...i want to increment value of ghi every time whenever it comes at last.  i have written a code in which i am able to increment value of ghi as many number of time as per my wish.  example ghi=1, ghi=2 etc.  but my code is also incrementing value of ghi even when ghi is encountered in middle for example..abc=1,ghi=1,def=2...in case if ghi coming in middle i don't want to increment it's value just want to process as it is.  i am able to increment value using for loop and simple substring code.  i cannot post code as it is too lengthy. can anyone suggest a way to do this using simple string operations.  i will try to apply your suggestion to my code.  please help."
