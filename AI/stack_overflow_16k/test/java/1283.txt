"exception in thread ""main"" when adding variable to a processbuilder i have a processbuilder that executes a shell script, it worked fine until i wanted to add an argument to the shell script from a variable...exception in thread ""main"" blank.lang.nullpointerexception.        at testone.main(testone.blank:10).....line 9:..string myarg = ""testarg"";...line 10 (the one that gives me the error):..final processbuilder processbuilder = new processbuilder(""/bin/bash"", ""-c"",.        testone.class.getresource(""/test.sh "" + myarg).getpath());...i understand that i have have concatenated the /test.sh with the string and that it would be treated as filename now which is why it gives me the error. i am however clueless how i could solve it."
