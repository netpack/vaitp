"'cannot cast from object to int' error when i'm sure the data is an integer i'm sure i'm doing something really dumb and basic here but i can't seem to figure this out.  i basically have a method that takes a bunch of numbers, does some work and returns a list of integers...i then take that list and send it to a method to do some more work on but when i was getting errors because jvm thinks its an object. here's a simple example(i'm editing it a bit so you get the idea and its not super long):..public static list normalizer_list(double[] data) {.    list normalizer_list = new arraylist();.    for (double current_data : data) {.        integer modified_data = (int) (current_data *1000);.        normalizer_list.add(modified_data);.    }.    return normalizer_list;.}...private static void do_some_work(list normalizer_list) {.    // todo auto-generated method stub..    for (int i = 0; i &lt; norm_data.size(); i++) {.        integer current_norm_data = (int) normalizer_list.get(i);...at first i tried to do math with norm_data.get(i) but it gave me errors because it thought it was a object, so i tried to cast it to an integer and it says i can't do that.  what am i doing wrong(is it the way i'm using the list?)"
