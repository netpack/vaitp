"how to use if statement to check on boolean values in my code inside the class, and outside the function. i have declared a boolean variable which is set to true. and, i am using if statement on this variable. for example, if the given variable is true the do this else do something else...but when i try to write code in eclipse. it gives me error stated below:..syntax error on tokens, constructorheadername expected instead..i just simply tried to create a boolean variable and assigned true to it (as simple). and then created if statement and put if(x == true). like this..class test {.    boolean x = true;..    if(x == true){.        //code.    }.    else {.        //else another code.    }..    public static void parta(){.        //code.    }.}"
