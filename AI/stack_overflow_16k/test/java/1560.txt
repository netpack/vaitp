"vector<point2d> .add() replacing all existing elements as well as appending i am developing with blank se on netbeans 7.3.1..i am trying to read the first two elements of each line of a csv file, put them input a point variable of type point2d and append each point to the end of the point2d vector coords.  i use the following code...br = new bufferedreader(new filereader(inputfilename));..vector&lt;point2d&gt; coords = new vector&lt;point2d&gt;();.point2d newpoint=new point2d.double(20.0, 30.0);.while ((strline = br.readline()) != null){.     string [] substrings = strline.split("" "");.     system.out.print(""substrings = "" + substrings[0] + "", "" + substrings[1]);.     system.out.println();.     newpoint.setlocation(float.parsefloat(substrings[0]), float.parsefloat(substrings[1]));.     coords.add(newpoint);          .}...coords.add(newpoint); appends the point as required but it also replaces every existing element in coords with the new point.  how do i stop the existing elements being replaced by the new element?"
