"sum the digit in an integer * write a programe that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the . * digits in the integer. for example, if an integer is 932 the sum of all its. * digits is 14.. */.package sumthedigitsinaninteger;../**. *.*/.import blank.util.scanner;..public class sumthedigitsinaninteger {..public static void main(string[] args) .{.   scanner input = new scanner(system.in);   ..   system.out.print("" enter a number between 0 and 1000 : "");..   int  num = input.nextint();..   int extract = num % 10;..   int remove_extract = extract / 10 ;..   int answer = extract + remove_extract;..   system.out.print("" the sum of the digit is "" + answer);..}    .}...i am so confused about this problem. i am reading a chapter in blank book called introduction to blank programming 9th edition by y.daniel liang. this chapter is a bout elementary programing which only teach me how to declare basic variable and do basic arithmetic. when i check online for help most of help i got with for loop or while loop which i have not read it yet. anyone know how to do this problem without for loop or while loop because i have not get to that chapter yet. i know % means a reminder of division and / means quotient. when i did this problem manual i got right answer for 932 which is 14. i got it by doing a division twice  by 10 and add a reminder of those two division which was a 3 and 2 then i add a motioned a 9 to 3+2 which gave me a 14. i am so confused how convert a this logic into source code with my little knowledge of loops. thanks."
