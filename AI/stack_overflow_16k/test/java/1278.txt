"hashset iterator remove never working for socket/thread class i'm working on a basic client/server blank app. everything works fine, except that the my code to remove ""dead"" connections never actually removes them...when a listener thread encounters an exception (broken pipe, etc) it sets a boolean that it's ""dead"", so that the next time the server thread runs, it scans for all connections marked ""dead"" and it should remove them so we don't try to write to them anymore...the code below runs, and i see the log message - but the .remove never does anything. when i debug pool.size() both before and after this code block, it never decreases - only increases when new connections are established...public static volatile hashset&lt;clientlistener&gt; pool = new hashset&lt;clientlistener&gt;(); ..iterator&lt;clientlistener&gt; listeners = pool.iterator();.while( listeners.hasnext() ){.    clientlistener l = listeners.next();.    if( l.isdead() ){.        myapp.log( ""removing dead/errored client listener..."" + l.getidentifier() + "" "" + l.listenerid );.        listeners.remove();.    }.}"
