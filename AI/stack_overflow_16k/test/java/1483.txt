incompatible types for mimemessage we have a project that is sending an email to our users...the line that's causing a problem is:..message msg = new mimemessage(session);...however it's displaying the following errors when i hover over it:..incompatible types..required: blankx.jms.message.found: blankx.mail.internet.mimemessage...i have blankee-api-7.0.jar as a dependency on the project. i'm not quite sure why it's having a problem.
