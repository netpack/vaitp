"blank interfaces and inheritance i have a very basic doubt about blank interfaces and inheritance..suppose i have two classes a and b and one interface c with following definitions..interface c{. public void check();.}..class a implements c{. public void check(){.  system.out.println(""a"");. }.}..class b extends a implements c{..// is the following method overriding the method from class a or implementing the method from c?. public void check(){.  system.out.println(""b"");. }..}...i am confused that whether it is over-riding or implementation of check() method in class b?"
