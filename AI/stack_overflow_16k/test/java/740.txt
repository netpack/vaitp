"number of bits allocated to 0 is 0 in blank- why? while learning biginteger.valueof(0l).bitlength() and biginteger.valueof(0l).bitcount() i found it is returning 0..however, the if consider 0 as a number then it should also needs one bit. ..from my understanding i expect 1 as return value for both methods instead of 0...public class test {.    public static void main(string[] args) {.        int bitlength = biginteger.valueof(0l).bitlength();.        int bitcount = biginteger.valueof(0l).bitcount();.        system.out.println(""bitlength="" + bitlength);.        system.out.println(""bitcount="" + bitcount);.    }. }...please help me understand why it is behaving like this ?"
