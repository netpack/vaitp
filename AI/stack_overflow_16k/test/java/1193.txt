"how to add backbutton functionality to app i'm trying to add a backbutton functionality to my app...however when i try to add the id of the backbutton like so,.. button back = findviewbyid(r.id.backbutton);.        back.setonclicklistener(new  view.onclicklistener().            {.               @override.                public void onclick(view v) {.                  finish();.                 }.             }...it just says the symbol for it is missing...i'm guessing and xml reference to the button is not present, where can i add it. also the navigation bar (the back and home button and such) is not showing in the bottom of the app in android studio, is there a way to enable that?"
