"logic error on standard deviation i've written this blank program for homework , but it is producing logic errors , and i'm not at all sure why. here's my code:.i also don't know why public class stndreddev { decided to remove itself from the code block, but its easy enough to read even so..first time posting, couldn't find a logic-error tag...edit: problem solved, i would post my finished code but this was a homework assignment so maby it should be removed? i'm new here so i don't know the policy on posting completed homework assignments..import blank.util.scanner;..public class stndreddev {..    public static void main(string[] args) {.        scanner input = new scanner(system.in);..        final int numofdigits=10;..        // declare double array.        double [] numbers = new double [numofdigits];..        // promt user.        system.out.println(""enter ten numbers : "");.        double k = 0;.        double j = 0;.        double deviation = 0;..        //begin computing mean.        for (int i=0; i &lt; numofdigits; i++) {.            numbers[i] = input.nextdouble();.            k += numbers[i];.        }.        double mean= k/numofdigits;..        // display mean.        system.out.printf(""the mean is %.2f"", mean);..        //begin computing standard deviation, i'm at a loss as to why this is still giving me logic errors..        for(int m=0; m &lt; numofdigits; m++) {.            deviation = math.pow((numbers[m]-=mean),2);.            j += deviation;.        }.        double stndrddeviation = j/numofdigits;.        double standarddeviation = math.sqrt(stndrddeviation);..        //display standard deviation.        system.out.printf(""the standard deviation is: %.6f"", standarddeviation);.    }.}"
