"blank httpconnection/httpsconnection input/error stream in blank how do you know whether you have an error stream from a http(s)connection or if it is an inputstream? the only way i can tell to do it is go for both, check for null and catch any exceptions. ..    httpconnection con = (httpconnection)url.openconnection();.    //write to output.    inputstream in = con.getinputstream();.    //vs.    inputstream error = con.geterrorstream();...how does blank determine which stream it has? is it based solely on response code of the connetion? so if its >=200 and &lt;300 then its inputstream otherwhise its an errorstream?..thanks."
