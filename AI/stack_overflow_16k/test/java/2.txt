"blank safe string.format and escaping % i'm using string.format method of blank api to log something. my method is like:..public static void log(string message, object... params){.    system.out.println(string.format(message, params));.}...however the problem is, if the user sends a message that has % character somewhere in it, it throws exception. here's a scenario:..log(""select * from my where name like '%six%'"");...and blank looks for something to replace %s (that's ok) and %' (oops). i want to fix that. because there there are no params and %s will be lost and %' causes exception...one solution can be message.replace(""%"", ""%%"") but i'm not sure it is an elegant solution or not."
