"constructor ambiguity with varargs in blank 8 in the class below, i get a compilation error with blank 8 due to an ambiguous call to this(). with blank 6 this class compiled fine, though..i know i could refactor this using factory methods and such but for the actual class where the problem occurs, i would strongly prefer to maintain the current api for now...can anyone think of a way to resolve the ambiguity without changing the external api?..public class vararg8 {..    public vararg8(final object... os) {}..    public vararg8(final boolean b,.                   final string s,.                   final int... is) {}..    public vararg8() {.        this(true, ""test"", 4, 5, 6);.    }.}"
