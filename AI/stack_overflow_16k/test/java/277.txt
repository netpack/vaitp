"not sure how this extractdigits method works? the person must create a while loop to  create an algorithm extractdigits that prints the individual digits of an integer. ex) extractdigits(123) outputs ""3"", ""2"", ""1""...i am not sure why exactly this method is correct and able to return each digit...while(num &gt; 0).       {.            system.out.println(num % 10);.            num = (num/10);.        }"
