how to make compareto sort a list alphabetically? how do i change my code so that it lists the elements in alphabetical order from a to z.  right now it's ordering from z to a.  i can't figure it out and am stuck :-/..    string sname1 = ((address)o).getsurname().tolowercase();.    string sname2 = (this.surname).tolowercase();.    int result = (sname1).compareto(sname2);..    return result;...thanks :)
