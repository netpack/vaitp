"cmputer not following rules i'm trying to come up with a reverse guessing game. computer to guess my selected number with a range of 1-100. i do have the binary search algorithm, but when i tell the computer it's first guess is too high, it will give me another high guess instead of going lower...import blank.util.random;.import blank.util.scanner;..public class computersguessgame {..public static void main(string[] args) {..    scanner in = new scanner(system.in);.    random value = new random();..    int computerguess;.    int highvalue = 100;.    int lowvalue = 1;.    string myanswer;..    do {.        computerguess = value.nextint(highvalue - lowvalue +1)/2;..        /*.         *above line should use the binary algorithm so the computer can.         *make guesses and not just guess my number by going one number at a time.        */..        system.out.println(""i'm guessing that your number is "" + computerguess);.        myanswer = in.nextline();...        if (myanswer.equals(""tl"")){.            highvalue = computerguess + 1;//too low answer.        }.        else if (myanswer.equals (""th"")){.            lowvalue = computerguess - 1;//to high answer.        }.    } while (!myanswer.equals(""y"")); //answer is correct..    in.close();.    system.out.println(""thank you, good game."");...        }.}//comptuer keeps making random guesses, but if i say too high, it will guess another high number instead of going low."
