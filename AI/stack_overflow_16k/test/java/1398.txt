"finding average character per word in a single string i'm kind of stuck on this issue. i'm trying to store 1 or more words in a single string, find the length of all the words combined then divide it by the number of words to find the average. i'm required to do this in a while loop (that's the objective of the homework)   ..when i enter ""hello my name is"" it returns the length as ..result:  .5  .2  .4  .2  ...but what i want is to add those results then divide it by the amount of words..5+2+4+2 = 13  .13/4 = 3.25...this is what i have so far:..scanner in = new scanner(system.in);..int counter = 0;.double sum = 0;..while (in.hasnext()) {.    string word = in.next();.    double totalchar = word.length();.    sum = totalchar + sum;.    counter++;...    double average = 0;.    if (counter &gt; 0) {.        average = sum / counter;..    }.    system.out.println(average);.}"
