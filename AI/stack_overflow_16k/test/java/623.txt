"nullpointerexception when passing / assigning values in my classes i am recieving this error whenever i run my program : ..exception in thread ""awt-eventqueue-0"" blank.lang.nullpointerexception.at course.enroll(course.blank:50).at appcoreprocessor.enroll(appcoreprocessor.blank:62).at coursewindow.actionperformed(coursewindow.blank:91).at blankx.swing.abstractbutton.fireactionperformed(unknown source).at blankx.swing.abstractbutton$handler.actionperformed(unknown source)...this is the code that generates the exception which is implemented in my course class: ..    public static void enroll(student student){.        student.setstatus(true);.        enrollees.add(student);.    }...this is the code from my appcoreprocessor class that calls the method:..    public static void enroll(int modelrow, int index) {.    oldcourse.get(modelrow).enroll(oldstudent.get(index));..    }...and finally this is the code that calls the enroll method from my appcoreprocessor class:..   public void actionperformed(actionevent event) {..        if(event.getsource()== enrollto){.        appcoreprocessor.enroll(modelrow,index);.        }...what i'm trying to here is that, i'm getting the selected index in my table which is exactly the same index in my arraylist of students, and same way, getting the selected index of course from another table. i will now use these values to call the static method enroll(int,int) from my app processor  class. and i just cant figure out why i'm getting the nullpointerexception? please help me , i'm only new to blank. ..edit*  this is my implementation of my arraylist of student and course, ..    public class appcoreprocessor {.private static arraylist&lt;student&gt; student = readandwrite.getdefaultstudentarrays();.private static arraylist&lt;course&gt; course = readandwrite.getdefaultcoursearrays();...and i'm using these arrays as data in my jtables, and before using the enroll method, i made a system.out.println statement to display the student at a given index and its really displaying the value, i checked the course is not null and the student is not null, but whenever i call the method of my course class enroll(student s) to enroll the student in that course, it just throws nullpointer exception ? which i dunno why ?"
