"how to make program display an error message if the input doesn't start with a letter just like what the title says i have been trying to do this for hours...system.out.print (""please input the first name: "");.name1 = in.next();..if (name1.substring(0,1).equals(""[a-za-z]"")).system.out.println(""t"" + name1.substring(0,1).touppercase()+name1.substring(1).tolowercase() + ""  is in the name list"");..else if (name1.substring(0,1).equals(""[0-9]""));.system.out.println(""error"");...this is part of the code that is not working out for me..i dont really know where i went wrong im a beginner at this..with this code whatever i write i get the second system.out.println back which is error. i want the program to display an error message if the string doesnt start with a number. also, please use the if statement to do that because i couldn't use something i have not covered otherwise i would have searched it."
