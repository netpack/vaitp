"blank.lang.noclassdeffounderror debugging, class was not loaded i have few dependancies (from logback packet) that are linked at the runtime (maven runtime scope). project compiles, but throws noclassdeffounderror when run (command is blank -jar my_uncool.jar)...i ran blank with  -verbose:class option and did not see my logback loaded. i checked the lib folder (./web-inf/lib/) and have all required logback's *.jar files...what might be the problem?.what are the ways to see the reason of blank.lang.noclassdeffounderror exception?"
