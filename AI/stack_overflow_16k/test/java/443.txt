"blank: how to pass typed-array class as parameter? i have some 3rd-party api with method somefn(int code, int[] data)...how can i express types (particulary array-typed argument) outside api container (interface class) for usage in class.getmethod(name, integer.class, ???.class);? how can i describe argument of array type properly?..as far as i know, i may use workaround like, but is there a better way of doing this?..class c { void f(int[] a) {} } }..c.class.getdeclaredmethods()[0].getparametertypes()[0]...thanks in advance"
