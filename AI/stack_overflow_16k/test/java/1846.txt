"if you have a string of characters, is it possible to substract each one? blank for (int i= length-1;i&gt;=0; i--){//reverses order of string..        password_2 = password_2 + password.charat(i);//store in new string.        system.out.print(password.charat(i));...basically after i inverse the order, i need to subtract 7 from each character. so lets say i input: ""kflre"". i need to subtract 7 from the k, from the l etc..and i wanted to do it within my for loop. is it possible or do i have to convert everything into ints before?"
