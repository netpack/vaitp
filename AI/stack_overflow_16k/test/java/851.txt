"time zone is not working properly in windows server if run this code in windows machine, its works properly:..simpledateformat sdf = new simpledateformat(""yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"");.system.out.println(sdf.format(new date()));...it shows date &amp; time same as clock, but the same code if i run on windows server it's showing -2hrs of clock time. ..i tried by the setting the timezone as, ..timezone timezone = timezone.gettimezone(""europe/vienna"");.sdf.settimezone(timezone);.then, it shows same as clock time....my doubt is why is it not taking the clock time zone by default in windows server."
