"does system.exit(0) as the last statement make a difference? blank 1.5+..how is class a different from class b ?..public class a {.    public static void main(string args[]) {.        system.out.println(""ending.."");.        system.exit(0);.    }.}..public class b {.    public static void main(string args[]) {.        system.out.println(""ending.."");.    }.}...if system.exit(0) or system.exit(1) is the last statement of the program to be executed, would class a and class b behave the same in all aspects of the program execution ?..i understand that by convention, a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination."
