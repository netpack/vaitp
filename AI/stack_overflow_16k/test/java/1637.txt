"what does ""u001b[j"" represent? can anyone explain to me what u001b[j within a string might represent? i'm converting an input byte stream to an ascii string. perhaps the stream is in some other encoding...update:..this is how i read the stream..inputstreamreader = new inputstreamreader(session.getstdout(), ""ascii"");..int length = inputstreamreader.read(buffer);.stringbuilder.append(buffer, 0, length);..// log the result.stringescapeutils.escapeblank(stringbuilder.tostring());"
