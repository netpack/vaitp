"blank guess game. how do i input data validation(range checking) and how do i input guesses? i have a project im working on for class. its a guessing game that gets a random number and the user guesses what it is. ive got a working version of the project, but according to my instructions, it needs data validation(range checking would be best) and it also needs to display a certain message depending on how many tries it takes the user to guess correctly. if its less than 3, it should say something like ""good job!"" if its more than 3 but less than 7, it should say something like ""need more practice."" if its more than 7 it should say something like ""need way more practice."" i dont want to have to de-construct my whole project, i would like to just add into it, and tweak accordingly. can someone give me a way of coding these things?..heres my code:...import blank.util.scanner;..public class guessinggamecalc {..    private static void displaywelcomemessage(int max) {.       system.out.println(""welome to the blank guessing game!"");.       system.out.println("" "");.       system.out.println(""i'm thinking of a number between 1 and"" + "" "" + max);.       system.out.println("" "");   .    }  ..    public static int calculaterandomvalue(int max){.       double value = (int) (math.random() * max + 1);.       int number = (int) value;.       number++;.       return number;.    }..    public static void main(string[] args){.        final int max = 100;.        string prompt = ""y"";.        displaywelcomemessage(max);.        int unit = calculaterandomvalue(max);.        scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);.        int counter = 1;..        while (prompt.equalsignorecase(""y"")) {.            while (true) {.                system.out.println(""please enter a number."");  .                int userentry = sc.nextint();..                if (userentry &lt; 1 || userentry &gt; max) {.                    system.out.println(""invalid guess! guess again!"");.                    continue;.                }..                if (userentry &lt; unit) {.                    system.out.println(""too low! guess higher!"");.                }else if (userentry &gt; unit) {.                    system.out.println(""too high! guess lower!"");.                } else {.                    system.out.println(""congratulations! you guessed it in"" + "" "" + counter + "" "" + ""tries!n"");.                    break;.                }.                counter++;.            }..            system.out.println(""would you like to try again? yes or no?"");..            prompt = sc.next();.            system.out.println(""goodbye!"");.       }.    } ..   public static void validatethedata() { }.}"
