"how do i create a blank library that is dependent upon another library? i am creating my own blank library to help me when creating games. this library is just for personal development. however, some of the commands within the library are dependent upon slick2d which is dependent upon lwjgl...question: how do i develop this library without including the other libraries inside that package?..p.s: i understand that when ever i use this library that i will have to use slick2d and lwjgl with it and i am ok with it."
