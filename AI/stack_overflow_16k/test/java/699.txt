"blank my app is not working on all versions of windows this seems really strange to me, i've gotten reports from some users that they are getting an error message when trying to run my application:..the version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are running.....they claim that they have the latest version of blank installed and are running a x64-based pc with windows 7..what i've done is compile the program into one .jar then run it through launch4j..what can i do to make my application work on all versions of windows? ..edit.it should be said that i have tried to reproduce this problem on several different windows setups but have been unsuccessful in getting any error messages."
