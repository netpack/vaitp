"make jlist visible even if there isn't anything to display i am working on an assignment which requires the use of jlist. ..basically it is an ordering shopping cart. i have 2 lists: one which has all of the items available to be purchased, and a second which holds the items that are ""added"" to the cart. it all works pretty well. however, i am having a tough time figuring out how to display the empty cart list when there aren't any items in it yet. i have an empty panel until it's filled. ..how can i make it visible all the time?"
