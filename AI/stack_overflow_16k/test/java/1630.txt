"how can a string be used to call an object method in blank? i have a class called ""skill"" with a getname() method. i use it to return the name of the skill objects that i create. when i try to compile my code, it says ""cannot find symbol- method getname()"". is there any way to get around this? for example, in my main method:..string[] playerskill = new string[1];.playerskill[0] = ""a"";.system.out.println(playerskill[0].getname());...and in my skill class:..public skill(string n, string d, int p) {.    name = n;.    description = d;.    power = p;.}..public string getname() {.    return name;.}...i know i cannot make the string look like a skill object:..system.out.println((skill)playerskill[0].getname());...the main problem is that the arrays are to be filled with user input so the arrays need to be string arrays. how would i get around this?"
