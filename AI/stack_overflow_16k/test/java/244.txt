button colour .setbackgroundcolour() onclick with delay if(characterarray[i] == '4').{.    btn3.setbackgroundcolor(0xff0000ff);//bright blue.    timedelay(300);.    btn3.setbackgroundcolor(0xff00008b);// dark blue.}...i'm trying to change the colour of a button when it is clicked and have it return to its original colour after a delay. i can get it to change colour but if i use a delay and then have it return to original it seems to skip the part where it changes to its new colour..i'm using .setbackgroundcolor()..any help appreciated.
