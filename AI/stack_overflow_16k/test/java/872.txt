"how to get the combinations of fixed number of elements and variable number of used elements (no repetitions) how to write a recursive method in blank which prints the combinations of 3 different numbers with variable count of the numbers used? (no repetitions should be included.) that is, the method should work for different combination lengths. for example, with the numbers 0, 1, 2 and two numbers used in the combinations you should have: 0  0 - 0  1 - 0  2 - 1  1 - 1  2 - 2  2...with the same numbers, combinations of 3 numbers are: .0  0  0 - 0  0  1 - 0  0  2 - 0  1  1 - 0  1  2 - (...),.and so on..i have checked several types of recursion methods in other similar topics, but i still cannot thoroughly understand this and write my own method."
