"how to import a blank class from a jar which isn't in a package? i have a .jar which contains a class that i want to use: foobar.class . this class is not in a package, its just sitting in the root directory of the .jar...i've added the .jar to the project as a library, but the problem is, i don't know how to import it since its not in a package...if i simply do: import foobar; i get the error: . expected, and i'm not able to use foobar class anywhere since it says symbol not found. ..any ideas?"
