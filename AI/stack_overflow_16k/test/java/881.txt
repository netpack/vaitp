"working with huge file (>10gb) i was googling and didnt find answer..so i have a huge file (>10gb), that i cant store in memory. the words are divided with ""|"". i need to find top 100000 most frequently used phrases. ..so i am going to read this file line by line using inputstream so i need memory only for 1 line. and then im planning to parse line into phrases...but how can i store the phrases? i want to use file for this (format: @phrase@ @count@). .file structure can be like this:...  phrase | count.  ""phrase1"" 17.  ""phrase2"" 5.  ""phrase3"" 6...each time i get phrase i am finding it in file, if there is no such phrase, i put it to the end of file and set count to 1. otherwise i increment count of this phrase. ..is it possible to do? i mean to write to a certain position in file? if so how can i do this? maybe there is some libs? or any other suggestions?"
