"is it possible to convert regular blank applications to web applications? what i mean by this question is that can people start a .jar application embedded on web or they have to download it ? i made a simple online game and people nowadays will not want to individually download the game instead of directly accessing it through the browser. i developed the game on desktop, which steps should i take to make it a web application, or can it directly be converted to a web application ?"
