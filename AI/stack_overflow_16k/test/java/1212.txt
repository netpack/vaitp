"updating a hashmap within a hashmap with a class sorry about the title really struggling to name this.  lets see how the question goes.......in blank i have a class called book which contains the following code.  where name is the book name, the hashmap string is the critics name and the hashmap integer is the critic score...public class book {..    private string name;.    private hashmap&lt;string, integer&gt; results = new hashmap&lt;string, integer&gt;();.}...i then have another class called bookrecord which contains the following code...private hashmap&lt;integer, book&gt; bookrecord = new hashmap&lt;integer, book&gt;();...i have written a ui that allows me to enter a new book and save that book into the bookrecord.  ..the integer in bookrecord is an id for the book..i have written a query to search by the id and return the name of the book.  now i want to be able to update the book if a new critic and score is available...i have been playing with a for each loop to find the right key in the book record and then if the key is found another for each loop but i have confused myself...any advice?"
