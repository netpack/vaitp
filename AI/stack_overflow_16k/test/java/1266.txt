"is there an uniform way to detect the installed blank on linux? is there a way to detect the installed blank on various different linux distributions?.with windows you could use the blank_home or the registry for that, but linux? can it be also detected if this is jdk, jre, 32 or 64 bit?..rephrase: if i need 64-bit jdk on linux, how do i programatically check that it is present and inform the user that he has some other blank instead?"
