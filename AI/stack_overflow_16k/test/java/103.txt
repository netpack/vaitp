"reversing digits numbers in blank i've looked around and came up with this solution, but it doesn't seem to be working. does anyone have an idea? i need to get a number from the user that is only 3 digits and positive. after that, to reverse the 3 digits. what i wrote below only give me the last digit out of the three that i need. ..int reversednum=0;.scanner scan = new scanner (system.in);.system.out.println(""please enter a 3 digit positive number whose first and last digits are different: "");.int usernumber = scan.nextint();..if (usernumber &gt;= 100 &amp;&amp; usernumber &lt;= 999).{.    system.out.println(""user number is: "" + usernumber);.    reversednum = (reversednum*10) + (usernumber%10);.    usernumber = usernumber/10;.    system.out.println(""difference ""+reversednum);.}.else .    system.out.println(""the number you entered is not a 3 digit positive number"");"
