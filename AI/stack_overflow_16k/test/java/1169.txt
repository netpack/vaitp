"write a program to find sum of squares of all numbers given the following conditions? .  given two numbers n1 and n2 such that n2>n1, find sum of squares of all numbers from n1 to n2 (including n1 and n2)....my approach:..i tried to solve the problem using a for loop iterated from n1 to n2 but i am getting wrong answer..below is my function for the code:..public int computesumofsquares (int n1, int n2) .{.    int sum=0;.    if(n2&gt;n1).    {.        for(int i=n1;i&lt;=n2;i++).        {.            sum=((sum)+(n1*n1));.        }.    }.    return sum;.    //write your code here..}...for the input ..parameters  actual output   expected output.'8' '10'    192             245"
