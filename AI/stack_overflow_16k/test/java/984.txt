random numbers 1-10 without repeating. why does this code not work. it compiles but still repeats this code repeats numbers and with the if statement i wrote in i don't think it should..class randomnumber {..    public static void main(string[] args) {..    int y = 0;.    int z = 0;.    int[] q = new int[10];..    while(y != q.length) {.        int x = (int) (math.random() * 10);..            if (x != q[0] || x != q[1] || x != q[2] || x != q[3] || x != q[4] || x != q[5].            || x != q[6] || x != q[7] || x != q[8] || x != q[9]) {.                q[z] = x;.                system.out.println(q[z]);   // or you could print x it doesn't matter.                y++;                        // i just chose this one to make sure each.                z++;                        // q[] was getting set to a value..            }.        }.    }.}
