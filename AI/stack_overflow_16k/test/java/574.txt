"is there a way to get the enum type from and ordinal value? what i mean by  that is suppose ..enum xyztype {..    a,.    b,.    c,.    d.}...i know i can get the ordinal a value of c, by doing   xyztype.c.ordinal() which is 2..suppose i just have 2, i would to get the enum type c.  i can't seem to find anything in the enum api that would do this.   i would prefer not to have a huge switch statement to compare each ordinal value and return the enum.   is there a better to do this ?"
