"getting the percentage of two numbers to the nearest tenth in blank i am trying to get the nearest percent of two numbers in blank, but it is not working...this is what i have so far:..decimalformat df = new decimalformat(""0.0"");.double pd1 = (minus1 / maxint) * 100;.p1 = string.valueof(df.format(pd1));...maxint is number possible, minus1 is maxint - 1 and then i multiply it by 100 to get the percentage and then the decimal format is suppose to round it to one decimal place, but it keeps returning a zero."
