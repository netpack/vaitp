"system.in.read(); comparing in my class we are starting to learn blank, we were tasked to explain why this code:..import blank.io.ioexception;.. class inputif {.    public static void main(string args[]) throws blank.io.ioexception {..         char ch, ch2;..         system.out.print(""hit a key and press enter: "");..         ch = (char) system.in.read();..         system.out.println(""hit a second key and press enter: "");..         ch2 = (char) system.in.read();..         if (ch == ch2) system.out.println(""same""); else system.out.println(""different""); .   }.}...outputs this: .output..in this screenshot i just started the program and typed ""a"" and then hit enter...when i run the program it asks me to enter the first char, then it should ask me to enter the second one, but it skips that and prints out the ""different"" end. i don't know why...the code should compare the two chars that the user inputs and if they are the same it should print ""same"" else it should say ""different""...thanks for any answers!"
