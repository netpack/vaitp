"conditional blank package distributions i know there isn't such a thing as conditional compilation as in c/c++ but i wonder if it is possible to produce a blank program conditionally based on requirements. for example, there could be a public version which contains some features and private version which contains more features...am i right to believe that the only way to achieve this is with the help of something like plugins, i.e. the different features are found dynamically if they are present in the classpath?"
