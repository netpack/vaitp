"zetcode.com blank: spaceinvaders player don't move anymore after i shot a bullet i tried to programm spaceinvaders with the tutorial:.spaceinvaders..everything is okay so far, but i could'nt find out how to set the focus again.on the player after i did a shot. so the player will not move anymore..i tried allready a couple of hours and so i know the keyevents are working - until i shoot..(system.out.println - for testing the events are ok)..i can move the player very fast befor i shot, but afterwards no chance..i can do shots again, but the vk_left` nor the vk_right will react anymore...i work with eclipse luna and blank build 1.8.0_40, and use the original code,.made me some little pngs..i just specified .iterator&lt;alien&gt; it = aliens.iterator(); and.changed: //  imageicon ii = new imageicon(this.getclass().getresource(shot));.to:     ..imageicon ii = new imageicon(shot);...because otherwise i get a nullpointer exception...this i tried in the board.class: workes a litte better, but the player still want move all the time i want..what bothers me most is, it works some times and without i can find a reason, the player stop and.want move anymore... private class tadapter extends keyadapter {..        @override.        public void keyreleased(keyevent e) {..                 //original just this code .               //player.keyreleased(e);..            //works better, but still not as expected.            if(ingame).            {.                if (e.getkeycode() == keyevent.vk_left || e.getkeycode() == keyevent.vk_right ).                {.                    player.keyreleased(e);..                }.                 if(e.getkeycode()== keyevent.vk_alt) .                 {.                     player.x += player.dx;.                          if (player.x &lt;= 2) .                            player.x = 2;.                        if (player.x &gt;= board_width -2*player.width) .                            player.x= board_width - 2*player.width;..                 }.            }..        }...i hope you can help me..nice regards.c."
