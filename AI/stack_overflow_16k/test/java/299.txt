"how to use string variables as a condition for looping purpose i was trying to prepare a flow chart of program for my practice where i encounter that following situation is required for me where a user would enter a string value as input either ""yes""or ""y"" and ""no"" or ""n"" and based on its input the application would either terminate or restart from a certain point till now i have this as an example in my mind ..public class applicationname {..    public static void main(string args[]) {.        string restartoperation;.        do {.            restartoperation = confirm_before_exit();.        } while (!restartoperation.equals(""no""));..        //rest of code .    }..    public static void some_operation() {.        //executed when called before closing application.    }..    public static string confirm_before_exit() {.        scanner inputdata = new scanner(system.in);.        string answer;.        system.out.println(""do you want to perform another operation ?"" + "" "" + ""y"" + "" "" + ""n"");.        answer = inputdata.nextline();.        switch (answer) {.            case ""y"":.            case ""yes"":.                some_operation();.                break;.            default:.                system.out.println(""good bye !"");..        }.        return answer;.    }.}...this works till the user has not given input as ""no"" but obviously it wont work if entered ""n"" or perhaps small ""n"" or even ""no"" but for timing i am only trying for ""no"" and ""n"" as input value."
