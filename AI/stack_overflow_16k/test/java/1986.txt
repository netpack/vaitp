"creating an object based on the state of another object in blank lets say you have a class called explosion where it does not make sense to create an instance of it, without some information from another class instance. the constructor is not made public...is it better to do it this way:..// both classes are in the same package  .explosion e;  .collision c = new collision()    .// do some stuff with collision  .e = c.createexplosion()...or is it better for explosion to have a static method for creating an instance and you pass in a collision object as an argument:..explosion e  .collision c = new collision()    .// do some stuff with collision  .e = explosion.createexplosion(c)...when you are the author of both classes."
