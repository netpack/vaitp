"difference in time between two dates in blank i have to find the difference in time between two different date objects in blank and if that time exceeds 5 sec i have to invalidate the session...here's the scenario :..i have a jsp page which set the session every 5 sec ..session.setattribute( ""sessionaccessedat"", new date() );...i have a another jsp page which is accessed every 1 sec ,..date date2 = new date();...now i have to compare in the another jsp that i have mentioned and invalidate the session,..date date1 = (date)session.getattribute(""sessionaccessedat"");.date date2 = new date();..differnce = date2 - date1;...thereby if the difference exceeds 5 sec, invalidating the session."
