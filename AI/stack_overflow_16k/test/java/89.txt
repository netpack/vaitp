"is it more optimal on memory when you don't save off objects inside a loop and inline them? here is what am trying to figure out...case 1:.for(foo foo : listoffoos) {.  bar bar = foo.getbar();.  if(bar == something) {.    //do something else.    continue;.  }.}..case 2:.for(foo foo : listoffoos) {.  if(foo.getbar() == something) {.    //do something else.    continue;.  }.}...if this list consists of five million foo's, would the second case be in anyway better than the first case in terms of speed or memory?"
