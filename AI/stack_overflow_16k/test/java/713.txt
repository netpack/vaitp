"how do i kill processes in blank without forcing it? i have a blank program that runs a number of other programs. once the user is finished they have a button to kill all processes, this should kill everything that is running but it should do it with forcing them. at least one of these other processes is also written in blank and has a number of shutdown hooks as it automatically saves a preferences file on exit and kills processes it has started itself, such as...    runtime.getruntime().addshutdownhook(new thread() {.      public void run() {.        if (process != null).            process.destroy();.      }.    }...when the main process calls destroy the above code is not run on the subprocess. is there anyway that i can terminate the processes so this will still run?..i am porting from perl which does it will the kill(9,@kill_process);..thanks."
