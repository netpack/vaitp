"how to get parent class of a variable in blank? lets say i have a class a, and a class b...public class classa{.    int a;.    classb b = new classb();.}    .public class classb{.    int someint;.    void somefunction(){.        //here i want to access the variable a of the current classa..    }.}`...the code is pretty self explanatory..i can add the classa in the constructor, but i dont want to do that as classb will be created by the user..so...perhaps some help here?"
