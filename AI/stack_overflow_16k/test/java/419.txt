"objectinputstream available() method doesn't work as expected (blank) i've been trying to figure out why a method i've written to read objects from a file didn't work and realized that the available() method of objectinputstream gave 0 even though the file wasn't fully read..the method did work after i've used the fileinputstream available() method instead to determine the eof and it worked!..why doesn't the method work for objectinputstram while it works for fileinputstream?..here's the code:..public static void getarrfromfile() throws ioexception, classnotfoundexception {.    product p;.    fileinputstream in= new fileinputstream(fname);.    objectinputstream input= new objectinputstream(in);.    while(in.available()&gt;0){.        p=(product)input.readobject();.        if (p.getprice()&gt;3000).            system.out.println(p);.    }.    input.close();...p.s-.i've read that i should use the eof exception instead of available() for this, but i just wanna know why this doesn't work...thanks a lot!!!"
