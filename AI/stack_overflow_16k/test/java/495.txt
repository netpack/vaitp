"estimate the average time when the value of a given parameter is increasing there is the following array track which indicates the increase of some parameter. each row refers to 5 days:..[0] 5.[1] 10.[2] 12.[3] 11.[4] 7.[5] 6.[6] 10.[7] 15.[8] 16...i need to estimate the average time when the parameter is increasing. in this example, from [0] to [2], and from [5] to [8]. the answer must be:..period 1 (from [0] to [2]) = 5+5+5 = 15 days. .period 2 (from [5] to [8]) = 20 days .answer = (15 + 20)/2 = 17.5 days...i wrote the following code. but it fails because curr is > than track.length at the last iteration. how can i solve this issue?..    private double getavggrowingtime(double[] track).    {.        list&lt;double&gt; timelist = new arraylist&lt;double&gt;();..        double temptime = 0.0;.        boolean stop = false;.        int curr = 1;.        while (curr &lt; track.length).        {.            while (track[curr]&gt;track[curr-1]).            {.                temptime += 5;.                stop = false;.                curr++;.            }.            if (!stop).                timelist.add(temptime);.            temptime = 0.0;.            stop = true;.            curr++;.        }..//.....    }"
