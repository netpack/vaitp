"the sum of two linked lists a class nat represents a number (n) by having pre field which points to the n-1 number, if pre is null it means the number is zero...public class nat { ..     private final nat pre; .     public nat (nat pre) { this.pre = pre; } .     public nat () { this(null); } .     public boolean iszero () { return pre == null; } .     public nat succ () { return new nat(this); } ..     â€¦ .    }...and i have to add a method which adds two numbers, i dont understand how this suppose to return a nat which represents the sum of ""this"" and other!..public nat plus (nat other) { .. if (other.iszero()) . return this; .. return succ().plus(other.pre); .} ...i think it creates a ""nats"" which point to the second nat of this (pre) all the time...could any one help me please?"
