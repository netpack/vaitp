"matching strings between lists and removing said string i have a few lists here. a default list which will never change, a temporary list which is the target for this code to change, and two other lists...i need to check both list2 and list3 (one at a time) for it's string contents, and then remove matched strings from list1temp. list1 is used for restoring the original strings to list1temp...to be quite honest, i am very new and i have an idea of how to approach this, but i am not sure how to even attempt...i am assuming i will need a for loop, and then use pop and append method...list1 = [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d""].list1temp = [""a"", ""b"", ""c,"" ""d""]..list2 = [""b"", ""c""].list3 =  [""a""]  #&lt;- this is still a list even though it has just one element because in the future it could be given more elements...i am struggling to match them"
