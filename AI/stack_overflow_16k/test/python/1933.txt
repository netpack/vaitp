"using function within function with parameters as tuples i want to create a function that takes in the following tuples a and b, and use a function that i had already created (cost) to add them together. for my question, it doesn't matter what cost() does...cost has the following arguments (name, amount, extra, team).  say someone provided me with a and b with the first 3 tuples.  if they don't provide team, i will just assume team = 1..a=('john', 20, 5).b=('matt', 30, 7)..def totalamount(a, b):.    a=(name, amount, extra, 1).    b=(sign, amount, extra, 1).    total=cost(u)+cost(v).    return total...the error is saying i'm missing the required positional arguments.  can someone help me on what im doing wrong here?"
