"blank proton api on_accepted() - how do i get the details of the msg being accepted, from the event parameter? there are a dozen ""hello world"" type examples i see where on_accepted() just counts the number of accepted msgs - where it is something to show that ""a message"" was accepted. however, i need to know which message was accepted. ..def on_accepted(self, event):.    m_id = event.message.id.    self.logger.info( 'accepted msg {0}'.format( m_id ))...this doesn't work because there is no valid message element in event, so i end up with a nonetype doesn't have an id type error. ..i looked at the members of the event parameter and i don't see anything which i thought would make sense.."
