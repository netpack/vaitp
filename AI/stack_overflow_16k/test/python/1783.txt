"learn blank the hard way: ex21, print output different than expected def add(a,b):.    print ""adding %d and %d"" %(a,b).    return a+b.def subtract(a,b):.    print ""subtracting %d from %d"" %(a,b).    return a-b.def multiply(a,b):.    print ""multiplying %d and %d"" %(a,b).    return a*b.def divide(a,b):.    print ""divide %d and %d"" %(a,b).    return a/b..print ""let's do some math""..age = add(30,5).height = subtract(78,4).weight = multiply(90,2).iq= divide(100,2)..print ""age: %d, height : %d, weight: %d, iq: %d"" % (age, height, weight, iq)..print ""here's a puzzle"".what = add(age, subtract(height, multiply(weight, divide(iq,2)))).print ""that becomes:"", what, ""can you do it by hand?"" #line25...output: ..let's do some math..adding 30 and 5..subtracting 78 from 4..multiplying 90 and 2..divide 100 and 2..age: 35, height : 74, weight: 180, iq: 50..here's a puzzle..divide 50 and 2..multiplying 180 and 25..subtracting 74 from 4500..adding 35 and -4426..that becomes: -4391 can you do it by hand?..my question: i feel, looking at the print command in line25, output remains same till ""here's a puzzle"". so, output should be: ..here's a puzzle..that becomes: ..divide 50 and 2..multiplying 180 and 25..subtracting 74 from 4500..adding 35 and -4426..-4391 can you do it by hand?..because, clearly print ""that becomes:"" is coming before what. so, why is the final output different?.thank you!"
