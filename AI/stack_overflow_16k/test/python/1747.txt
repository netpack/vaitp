"blank method using multiple same kwargs is there a way to have a blank funciton/method accept multiple kwargs that are the same key?..example:..def foo(**kwargs):.    print kwargs['a']..foo(a=1, a=2).[1, 2]...or something along the lines of that...i know kwargs wouldn't be a standard dictionary at that point. i have a feeling i already know the answer to this but figured i ask if black magic existed in meta classes somewhere...i'm trying to mimic another language as close as possible.  titandb has a query language ontop of gremlin and in gremlin the methods accept keyword args that repeat..g.v(256).oute(label='knows', label='likes').inv...i would like to stay as close to this as possible."
