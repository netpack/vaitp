"how to work with a lot of directory & element strings? i have a blank class which uses selenium, takes and opens a web path. i am trying to find a way to make a list of the full xpath or element id's in a separate file (txt or json or whatever you believe is best) to store all thge elementids in, then the it will take the the file and link it, for example the following xpath will be as:..xpath1='/html/body/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td/table[''1]/tbody/tr/td/div/form/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/input'...my code will then look in this file, take the path and assign it to the variable. but what is the best way to store all these paths and id's. i am sure that storing 30/40 these in script inst good etticate?"
