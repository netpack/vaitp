"parsing firewall rules in blank i am writing a script to parse firewall rules from the configuration of a cisco asa...examples of my input include:..access-list myacl line 1 extended permit tcp host 10.8.13.200 host 10.32.53.22 eq 1122.access-list myacl line 2 extended permit tcp 10.8.13.0 255.255.255.0 host 10.1.206.17 eq 445 .access-list myacl line 3 extended permit udp host 10.8.13.200 eq 54345 host 10.1.206.17 eq 445.access-list myacl line 4 extended permit icmp any any...my desired output, in the form of a .csv, for the three lines above would be the following. however, these could just as well be tuples to be stored in a database...#aclname,linenumber,action,protocol,sourceip,sourceport,destip,destport.myacl,1,permit,tcp,10.8.13.200,*,10.32.53.22,1122.myacl,2,permit,tcp,10.8.13.0/24,*,10.1.206.17,445.myacl,3,permit,udp,10.8.13.200,54345,10.1.206.17,445.myacl,4,permit,icmp,*,*,*,*...i'm having trouble choosing an approach to this project. i've looked at many options including ats, shlex, or even just using a regex, but i'm having difficulty determining what the best option is. would ply help here?..what would be a suitable approach for this?"
