"problem with second run: rock, paper, scissors problem - blank so, i created a code that simulates the rock, paper, scissors game. when i first open the program, it works! fresh from the start, it works. ..the problem is when there is a second run. for some reason, my ""while"" doesnt work anymore. the while loop should stop when any player reaches 3 wins. yo can see that i reached 17 and 13 wins and the thing doesnt stop... ....this is happening only on the post-first-runs of the program...code:..###########function of the random module.import random..###########possible options of play and the number of single wins to win the match.options = [""stone"", ""paper"", ""scissors""].win_the_game = 3..############function that randomly returns one of the 3 options..def machine_play(a):.    return(random.choice(a))..############function that asks your choice: 'stone', 'paper' or 'scissors'..def user_play():.    a = input(""enter your choice: "").    if a not in options:.            print(""not a valid option, try again ('stone', 'paper', 'scissors')"").    while a not in options:.        a = input(""enter your choice: "").        if a not in options:.            print(""not a valid option, try again ('stone', 'paper', 'scissors')"").    return a..############function that resolves a combat..def combat(mchoice,uchoice):.    if mchoice == uchoice:.        return 0.    elif uchoice == ""stone"":.        if mchoice == ""scissors"":.            return 2.        else:.            return 1.    elif uchoice == ""paper"":.        if mchoice == ""stone"":.            return 2.        else:.            return 1.    elif uchoice == ""scissors"":.        if mchoice == ""paper"":.            return 2.        else:.            return 1..############variables that accumulate the wins of each participant.machine_wins = 0.user_wins = 0..#######################     the final loop or program     ######################.while machine_wins or user_wins &lt; win_the_game:.    user_choice = user_play().    machine_choice = random.choice(options).    print(""the machine choice is: "", machine_choice)..    the_game = combat(machine_choice, user_choice).    if the_game == 1:.        machine_wins += 1.    elif the_game == 2:.        user_wins += 1.    else:.        print(""its a tie!! continue"")..    print(""nuser wins: "", user_wins, ""nmachine wins: "", machine_wins)"
