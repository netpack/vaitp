"why does the blank interpreter show syntax errors on the following line? i've been helping a new blank user with some code, and he asked me why the blank interpreter shows some syntax errors on the line after the actual error. consider the following code:..x = [1, 2, 3.print x...a syntax error will be shown for the line with print x, although the error is really on the previous line...this can be very confusing (and time wasting) the first time you run into it, it is a very common issue (search for ""blank syntax error"" on your favourite search engine), and it seems like it wouldn't be difficult to rectify... why hasn't it been fixed? is there some benefit to the present approach?"
