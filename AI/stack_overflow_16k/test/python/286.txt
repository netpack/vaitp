"any better way to generate a tuple of all possible tuples in form of (x1,y1,x2,y2)? i want to generate a tuple of tuple in form of ((x1,y1,x2,y2),...(x1,y1,x2,y2)) where x1,y1,x2,y2 are all in range of (0,8)...is there any other way rather than the following?..s = list().for x1 in range(0, 8):.    for y1 in range(0, 8):.        for x2 in range(0, 8):.            for y2 in range(0, 8):.                s.append([x1,y1,x2,y2]).s = tuple(s)       ...thanks"
