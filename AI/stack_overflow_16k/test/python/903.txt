"why does importing a function from a module import the whole module? i'm new to blank and i'm just testing importing a function from one module into another module using from module_name import function. however, when i import the function it also imports and executes a for loop that is not a part of the function but is part of the module...module 1:.. from fibonacci import fibonacci.    fibonacci(10)...module 2:..def fibonacci(number):.    for i in range(1,number+1):.        if i == 1:.            sumcount = 0.            first = 0.        elif i ==2:.            second = 1.            sumcount = 1.        else:.            sumcount = first + second.            first = second.            second = sumcount ..    print(sumcount)..for f in range(1,10):.    fibonacci(f)...when i import the function fibonacci, the for loop is executed. why is this and how can i stop this?"
