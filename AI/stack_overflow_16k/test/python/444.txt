"translating a phrase using a dictionary i'm attempting to translate a phrase using a dictionary by matching each word in that phrase with a dictionary's key...http://paste.org/62195..i can translate it just well through the interactive shell, but when it comes to the actual code:..def translate(dict):.    'dict ==&gt; string, provides a translation of a typed phrase'.    string = 'hello'.    phrase = input('enter a phrase: ').    if string in phrase:.         if string in dict:.            answer = phrase.replace(string, dict[string]).            return answer...i'm not sure what to set string to that would check for anything other than 'hello.'"
