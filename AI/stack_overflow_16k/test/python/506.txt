"how can i open a file from a location that everyone has but under a different name? i'm trying to open a .txt file under the appdata folder but i cannot understand how to make blank open from a specified directory with different names..import os.f=open(""os.getenv('appdata')/local/filedir/filename.txt"",'r+')...that's what i came up with after few minutes of googling but i don't really know how should i implement os.getenv('appdata') to work. if i print it,it says the right path but if i put it together with the rest of the path it says it cannot find it."
