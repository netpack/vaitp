"never ending while in this code i try to call a function. on the other hand its not working the way i want it to work, for it is staying in the loop even though i am changing the loops condition options_secondscenario[0] from 0 to 1 at the end of the loop. what i want this to do is to move to third_scenario() function. thanks in advance...options_secondscenario = ['whats going on out there?', 'so what now?']..def third_scenario():.    print ""this is the third scenario"".    choiceselection2 = raw_input(""&gt; "").    if choiceselection2 == 1:.        print ""stay"".    else:.        print ""leave""..def dead():.    print ""you are dead"".    exit()..def second_scenario():.    print ""conversation 1"".    print ""conversation 2"".    print ""conversation 3"".    print options_secondscenario.    choices = options_secondscenario[0].    while choices == options_secondscenario[0]:  .        choiceselection = raw_input(""&gt; "")   .        if choiceselection == 'whats going on out there?':.            print ""conversation 4"".        elif choiceselection == 'whats up':.            print ""nothing""        .        elif choiceselection == 'what is that':.            print ""i dont know"".        elif choiceselection == 'is':.         dead()        .        else: .         third_scenario().    choices == options_secondscenario[1]..second_scenario()"
