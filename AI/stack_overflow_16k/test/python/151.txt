"how can i fix nameerror in __init__? i was trying to make my first discord bot. i got this error: nameerror: name 'exceptions' is not defined. it was in __init__. i guess that something is wrong with names...here's how my __init__ looks like:..from .client import *.from .exceptions import *.from .protocol import *.from .server import *.from .uri import *.from .version import version as __version__  # noqa..__all__ = (.    client.__all__ +.    exceptions.__all__ +.    protocol.__all__ +.    server.__all__ +.    uri.__all__.)...if i need to add something else, tell me in comments."
