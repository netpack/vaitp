"how to read and change bam files from a blank script? i'm planning on using a blank script to change different bam (binary alignment map) file headers. right now i am just testing the output of one bam file but every time i want to check my output, the stdout is not human readable. how can i see the output of my script? should i use samtools view bam.file on my script? this is my code...#!/usr/bin/env blank..import os.import subprocess...if __name__=='__main__':.    for file in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):.        if file == ""srr4209928.bam"":.            with open(""srr4209928.bam"", ""r"") as input:.                content = input.readlines().                for line in content:.                    print(line)"
