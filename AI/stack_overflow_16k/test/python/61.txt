"simplifying reverse triangle code (while loop) i have successfully created a code to print a horizontally flipped triangle using a while loop. now although it works, i was wondering if i could simplify this i.e. without using a ""store"" variable. but i want to keep it using a while loop..current code is:..mylen = int(input(""enter the number of rows: "")).while mylen &lt; 1 or mylen&gt; 40:.      print(""the number of rows must be greater than 1 and less than 40"").      mylen = int(input(""enter the number of rows: ""))..mynewlen=1.store=mylen.while mynewlen &lt;=store:.      print(("" ""*(mylen-1))+""*"" * mynewlen).      mynewlen=mynewlen+1.      mylen=mylen-1...which will print out a result of:..    *.   **.  ***. ****.*****...i was wondering how i could simplify this code for efficiency."
