"global name for the directory of project i'm making an e-mail sending script in blank, in which the code for the attachment is as follows:..filename = ""output.txt"".attachment = open(""/root/desktop/test/output/project/file.txt"", ""rb"")...now, the problem is the directory output has been changed as per the name of my project. so is there any way that i can use a global name for this?"
