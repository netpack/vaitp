"blank: changes to my copy variable affect the original variable i've got a list that i create a copy of in order to do some manipulations while still keeping the original list. however, when i set copy_list equal to org_list, they become the same thing, and if i change copy_list, org_list changes too. for example:..org_list = ['y', 'c', 'gdp', 'cap']..copy_list = org_list..copy_list.append('hum')..print(copy_list).print(org_list)...returns..['y', 'c', 'gdp', 'cap', 'hum'].['y', 'c', 'gdp', 'cap', 'hum']...i don't know too much about what is actually going on but it looks like org_list is actually  passing itself to copy_list so that they are actually the same thing...is there a way to make an independent copy of org_list without doing something clumsy like:..copy_list = [].for i in org_list:.    copy_list.append(i)...i say this because i have the same problem with other types of variables, for example a pandas dataframe."
