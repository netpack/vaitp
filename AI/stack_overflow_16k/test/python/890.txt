"why are my if statements only responding to the first measurement? thank you whitebeard and everyone else ! functions properly now...i have a function that measures the time it takes to charge a capacitor, then prints out that time at the end, which works as intended. i have 2 if statements that i need to update every cycle, but they only react to the very first measurement of the script. any explanation for why this is would be greatly appreciated...import rpi.gpio as gpio, time.gpio.setmode (gpio.board)..def rctime(rcpin):.    reading = 0.    gpio.setup (rcpin, gpio.out).    gpio.output (rcpin, gpio.low).    time.sleep(.1).    gpio.setup (rcpin, gpio.in).    while (gpio.input(rcpin) == gpio.low):.        reading += 1.    return reading.if rctime &lt;= 300000:.    relay1 = true.if rctime &gt; 300000:.    relay1 = false..while 1:.    print rctime() #works as intended.    print relay1  #only works for the first cycle...thus far, thats my entire code..why does relay1 print the proper true/false statement the first cycle?.im not sure where my indents are wrong.initialize relay1 = none at the top?.even though ""print rctime()"" does work currently, should i not use that function as a variable? how should i make it something different?.i very much appreciate all your help. im trying to grasp good fundamentals"
