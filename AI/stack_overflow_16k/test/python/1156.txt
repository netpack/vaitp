"make a dictionary from two lists after applying a function i have two lists of tuples..keys = [(0,1), (2,1)].values = [('a','b'), ('c','d')]...i want to make a dictionary dict that will apply a function f1 to each..dict.keys[i] = keys[i][0], keys[i][i]: f1(keys[i][0],keys[i][1])...and for the values of the dictionary, i would like to be tuples ..dict.values[i] = (f2(values[i][0]), f2(values[i][1]))...what is the most efficient way of doing that in one pass in a blankic way?"
