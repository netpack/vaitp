"an efficient blankic way of mapping values? i have some values to remap based on there being two ways to specify a rule.  the simple if / else method appears the more efficient variant, but i wonder if there is an equally as efficient but more blankic approach?.. if mod == ""i"": mod = ""+"". elif mod == ""e"": mod = ""-"". elif mod == ""d"": mod = "":"". elif mod == ""m"": mod = "".""...not so efficient mapping approach:.. mod = { ""i"":""+"", ""e"":""-"", ""d"":"":"", ""m"":""."" }.get(mod, mod)"
