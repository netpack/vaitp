"what is the difference between two below definitions for lambda? i saw two models for lambda and could not use them instead of them. you suppose:..languages = [""html"", ""javascript"", ""blank"", ""ruby""].print max(lambda x:x==""blank"", languages)...you can see it is started with lambda then x:x and at the end the name of list(y). suppose below:..languages = [""html"", ""javascript"", ""blank"", ""ruby""].print max(languages,key=lambda x:x==""blank"" )...i found that in an example. in this one a parameter is equal with lambda, the name of list is in the beginning and it is different all in all from the first one. are there two different definitions?.thanks"
