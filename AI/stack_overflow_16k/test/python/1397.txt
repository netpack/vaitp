"using data from csv to make directories i have a .csv file such as the following:..name1,name2,name3 and so on...using blank script i am trying to have it read the .csv and make directories for each value.eg: name1,name2,name3 will create these directories :name1 and name2 and name3..this is my code so far:..import os.import fileinput.textfile = 'e:/videos/movies/subtest/dirlist.csv'.path = ""e:/videos/movies/subtest/""..#generate a txt file with the current names of the directories.def makefile():.    # open a file.    dirs = os.listdir( path ).    # this would print all the files and directories.    for file in dirs:.        #open the file.        tfo = open(textfile, ""ab+"").        #write to the file, seprating each item with ""||"".        tfo.write( file + ',' ) .        #print output.        print ( file ).        #prints confirmation.        print 'file printed!'.        #close the file.        tfo.close().    mainmenu()..def makedirs():.    #open textfile as read only and set its varible as mylistread.    mylistread = open(textfile, 'rb+').    #reads the x amount of lines and stores it as str.    str = mylistread.read();.    for line in str:.        os.makedirs(path + str).    print 'directories created:', str...running this code creates the .csv as i intended, but when i run makedirs() it makes the directory name all of the .csv (name1,name2,name3 as the foldername)"
