"how to run function while also returning value in blank i am currently running a program that has a robot shifting piles of ""beepers""...i want to be able to return a value from a function while also running that function. when i run the function, it stops the program. i'm using a module called pykarel which is creates a robot and beepers. count_beepers_1_1 and count_beepers_2_1 are global variables, and count_beepers_1 and count_beepers_2 are local variables that are defined within the shiftpiles method. i want to save over the local variables into the global variables. here is my code...def shiftpiles(arg, count_beepers_1, count_beepers_2):.   #shift the piles of beepers.   return count_beepers_1, count_beepers_2...while piles &gt; 0:.   count_beepers_1_1, count_beepers_2_2 = shiftpiles(bob, count_beepers_1_1, count_beepers_2_1)"
