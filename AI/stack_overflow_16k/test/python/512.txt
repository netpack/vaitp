"beginner index out of range in blank this is a problem i am working on for a class (below is my question and the code i wrote):..the program should accept a series of students and their exam scores in response to a .""?"" prompt. enter the two digit exam score (no one ever gets 100 or less than 10), a single.space and the name of the student. keep entering these until the user enters ""stop"" – .your program should be able to handle any form of ""stop"" – for example, ""stop"", ""stop"", .""stop"", ""stop"", etc..you should then display a list of student names ordered by their exam scores (low to .high)..for instance (user input is underlined):..? 23 warren.? 44 dona.? 33 tom.? stop.warren.tom.dona...so i understand everything i've written and i understand that this is not an especially complicated problem. though, the way my code is written, when i input ""stop"" to show the program that i am finished with inputs, it runs the input ""stop"" in the for loop creating a index out of range error. how can i make it run ""stop"" only in the while loop and not in the for loop?..    students = [].    namescore = """".    while (namescore.lower() != ""stop""):.        namescore = input (""? "").        students.append(namescore)..    students.sort()..    for student in students:.        x = student.split().        print (x[1])"
