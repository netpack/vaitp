"blank - create an arbitrary number of lists to store all values in a column i have csv files in which the number of columns are not constant. for each column, i am trying to store all values in that column into a separate list so that i can count the number of recurring values. i have written some code to do this but, it does not seem to append into a list well enough...sample input is love hurt hit. .my input is a csv file with a varible number of rows and a variable number of columns. it keeps changing for a different csv file. say one file has 3 columns and the next file has 20 columns. yes and no are the values which are present under all those columns. the occurrence of those values is random. what i want to do is extract all the values in each individual column, and append them to a list. so, once i exit the for loop, i would ideally like to see all values in a given column; not the last value nor each value printed one below the other. ..when i append all the values, it should be ['love', 'yes' 'no', 'yes' ......] where yes and no are values under the column of love..instead, i have each value printed on a new line such as:..['love']..['yes']........this is what i have so far. please help!..a,b,c = [],[],[].headings = [].allcols = []..def getcolcount(currline):.    return len(currline)    ..# open the file and read it.with open(filename1, 'r') as f1:.. csvlines = csv.reader(f1, delimiter=',').. for linenum, line in enumerate(csvlines):.      colcount = getcolcount(line)               .      allcols = [[] for x in range(0, colcount)]         ..      a.append(line[0])            # this prints like i want it to - in series..      for i in range(0, colcount):..           allcols[i].append(line[i])   # this doesn't..      print ','.join(allcols[2])"
