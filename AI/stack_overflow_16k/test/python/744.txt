"check blank interactive mode in sitecustomize i have a motd-type message which prints on invocation of the interpreter. currently this is printed up in sitecustomize. i'd like to suppress the message if the interpreter is not in interactive mode; unfortunately all of the checks in .tell if blank is in interactive mode do not work in sitecustomize. (sys.argv, sys.ps1, __main__.__file__ are not populated.) are there checks which work in sitecustomize?"
