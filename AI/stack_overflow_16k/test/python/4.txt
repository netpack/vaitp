"blank pefile member question gang,..i apologize if this is a really dumb question...  i am wanting to use the super convenient blank script pefile (http://code.google.com/p/pefile/) that parses an executable and lists particular information about the pe structure.  my question is where can i find information about how to access particular members of the executable?  i've scoured the wiki and read the usage examples but that documentation only covered 4-5 members.  what i am wondering is if you guys have a list of members i can access to display the information i care about.  so specifically,  if i wanted to list the stack commit size of an executable, does it look like this: pe.file_header.stackcommitsize, obviously i can run this code and figure it out but have you guys seen api doc floating around that i find the members i need?..thanks!"
