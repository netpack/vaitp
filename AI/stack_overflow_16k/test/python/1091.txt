"convert all input parameters of function with generic function i am writing a function which gets users from database and returns a list of user objects..function signature is as given below:..def select_users(self,userid,firstname,lastname,emailid,tenants,groups):.    result = self.authservice.select_users(userid,firstname,lastname,emailid,tenants,groups)...in this function, i call select_users method of authservice object which will return a list of custom user objects. but if any of input parameters has '' value then it must be converted to none because self.authservice.select_users cannot handle empty strings. i can check each element value and convert it to none if it is empty, but i want it to be generic and reusable. if i could write a different function which can give me updated list of input parameters it would be very helpful. please let me know how do i do that?"
