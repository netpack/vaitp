"programmatically parse a blank class/py file at runtime, to find if it contains a given function i have few blank files with classes, each class contain unit tests. ..was wondering if it is possible to parse these py files, and their classes, to know if it contains a specific test?..examples1.py.    class stresstest.        test1.        test2.        test3.    class verifications.        testa1.        testa2..examples2.py.    class basicfeatures.        testa.        testb.        testc...for example, if i want to run testa, i can retrieve which class and file contains it, so i know that i need to call the class basicfeatures from examples2.py file, and so on..my first approach was to load the py file as stream and check in each line if the test name as string is present, but it doesn't look very efficient. i assume there is a programmatical way to check if a function is included in a class, but i do not load these files unless i need to run the unit tests in them...it works when searching the string in the stream file, but i would like to try different options, and if possible, something less cumbersome."
