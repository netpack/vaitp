"blank same script opens files in order in one dir and not in another for file screening i have following code in two different directories:..import os, re..g=open('results_1.txt', 'w') #other has 'results_2.txt'..for filename in os.listdir('.'):.    if filename.startswith(""f""):.        with open(filename, 'r') as f:.            content =[line.rstrip() for line in f]..        a = filter(lambda x: 'keyword_1 :' in x, content).        b = filter(lambda x: 'keyword_2 :' in x, content)..        print &gt;&gt; g,filename,..        for item in a:.            print &gt;&gt; g,item,.        for item in b:.            print &gt;&gt; g,item,..g.close()...both directories have similar file (to be parsed my script) naming convention. so files look like this: file_1000.txt, file_100.txt, file_101.txt,.....,file_1.txt,......file_9.txt...i change the script just to change the name of results file. but in one directory the files are sorted from _1 to _1000 and then results file has appropriate order while other does not. why?..i am sorry this is related to my work and i can give any specifics...p.s. i tried sorted function and it did not work as i wanted."
