"two string replacement at the same time i want to replace chars in a string, but it must all happen at the same time..i don't want one replacement to affect the second. ..for example, i have the string ""hello world"". i want to replace h with e and e with h. i want the end result to be ""ehllo world"" and not ""hhllo world"", which is what will happen if i run 2 replace functions one after another...i know i can do it by iterating once on the string but i was wondering if there was a more blankic way to do this."
