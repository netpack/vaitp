"why a variable is required to open files i'm having a bit of a conceptual problem. for writing to the file ""to_file"", this works:..out_file = open(to_file, 'w').out_file.write(indata)......but this doesn't:..(open(to_file, 'w')).write(indata)...in theory, shouldn't swapping out a variable's (out_file) definition for the variable itself produce the same result? i'm confused as to why the extra step of creating the variable is necessary."
