"how to reinitialize list in loop iteration? i'm trying to create draws without replacement, and output the result of each draw as a text file. the list is in a separate file, and i want to re-import it for each iteration of my loop..import random.import numberlist..counter=0.draws= 100.while (counter&lt;draws):.    x=  numberlist.listx     #this imports a list of strings eg. ['a341','c32k','42b]]..    random.shuffle(x)     ..    x.pop().    """"""operations with popped value""""""..    counter += 1...what i was hoping for was that x would be realitialized to the the complete listx at the beginning of every loop iteration. instead what i""m finding is that every time i pop a number, the list gets smaller every loop iteration. why is this happening, and how can i get around it?..thank you."
