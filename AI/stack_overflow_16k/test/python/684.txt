"updating a line in terminal with blank i'm not sure where to start with this, so even pointing me in the right direction would be helpful. i would like to update a line continuously in the terminal using blank but can't figure out how to do this. i'm thinking something like top is doing with constantly updated information but not printing new lines...so simplistically something like this:..for i in mylist:.    print i #but overwrite previous output rather than putting on new line"
