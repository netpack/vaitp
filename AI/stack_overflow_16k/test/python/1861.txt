"what's the best way of distinguishing bools from numbers in blank? i have an application where i need to be able to distinguish between numbers and bools as quickly as possible. what are the alternatives apart from running isinstance(value, bool) first?..edit:.thanks for the suggestions. actually, what i want to be able to do have a check for numbers that leaves out bools so that i can reorder my checks (numbers are far more prevalent) and improve my negacalls. isinstance() itself is fast enough. the x is true or x is false is intriguing."
