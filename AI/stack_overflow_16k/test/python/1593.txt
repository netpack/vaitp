"how can i get this code to include more than just the first occurrence in the loop? i am trying to take an input and output it with alternating upper and lower case. ..example, if i type in the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the o's in fox and dog aren't output the way i'd like. same thing happens with double vowels too like ""good"" or ""beets"" etc. is there a way to make the code include occurrences after the first? also i haven't learned enumerate or any modules like that, i was trying to make it work with what i have learned so far. thank you...text = input('enter a sentence: ')..def sponge(t):.    new = ''.    for i in t:.        if int(t.index(i)) % 2 == 0:.            new += i.lower().        else:.            new += i.upper().    return new..print(sponge(text))"
