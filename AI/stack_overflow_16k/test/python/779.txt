"removing quotes from text files i need to read a pipe(|)-separated text file..one of the fields contains a description that may contain double-quotes..i noticed that all lines that contain a "" is missing in the receiving dict..to avoid this, i tried to read the entire line, and use the string.replace() to remove them, as shown below, but it looks like the presence of those quotes creates problem at the line-reading stage, i.e before the string.replace() method...the code is below, and the question is 'how to force blank not to use any separator and keep the line whole ?""...with open(filein) as txtextract:.    readlines = csv.reader(txtextract,delimiter=""Âµ"").    for line in readlines:.        (...).        li_text = newline[107:155].        li_text.replace(""|"",""/"").        li_text.replace("""""","""") # use of escape char don't work....note: i am using version 3.6"
