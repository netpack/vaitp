"compare the number of significant digits in two numbers for a coding exercise i'm working on, i'm trying to compare two numbers and choose the one that has the larger number of significant digits. ..for example: compare 2.37e+07 and 2.38279e+07, select 2.38279e+07 because it has more significant digits. ..i don't know how to implement this in blank. i considered counting the length of each number using len(str(number)), but this method returns ""10"" for both of the numbers above because it doesn't differentiate between zero and non-zero digits. ..how can i compare the number of significant digits in blank?"
