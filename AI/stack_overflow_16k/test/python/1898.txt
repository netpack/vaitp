"assigning values of keys using a for loop in a list or array in blank, we can use a for loop to print out keys and values like the following:..for k, v in dict.items():.        print(k,v)...i understand this. but but i have a hard time understanding the following lines of code...count = [['unk', -1]].count.extend(collections.counter(words).most_common(vocabulary_size - 1)).# made a new dictionary.dictionary = dict().# here is where i'm confuse.for word, _ in count:.    dictionary[word] = len(dictionary)...does this means that every word in the dictionary are keys and the length of the dictionary is the value?"
