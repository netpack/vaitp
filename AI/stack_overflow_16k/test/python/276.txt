"catching the traceback on keyboardinterrupt() i have a code that i use to stop on ctrl+c. i would like to do some things juste after i did ctrl+c. therefore i write:..try:.    work().except keyboardinterrupt:.    do_other_stuff()...but i don't see where i did ctrl+c, as no traceback prints; i want to see the usual message..    traceback (most recent call last):.       file ""x.py"", line 16, in &lt;module&gt;.         ......how can i print this? i tried to do..    except keyboardinterrupt as e:.       print str(e).       do_other_stuff()...but it prints nothing."
