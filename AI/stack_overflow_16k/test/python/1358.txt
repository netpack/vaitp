"unable to check for space, new line and delimiter from text file - blank text file has multiple lines such as below:..01      19-07-2000      09:30:40        'fe2962545516         5001.01      19-07-2000      09:30:40        'fe2962545516         5001.01      19-07-2000      09:30:40        'fe2962545516         5001.01      19-07-2000      09:30:40        'fe2962545516         5001...my code: ..readfile = open(file,'r').read = readfile.read().print(read.strip())...the problem is that blank doesn't read the space between all values and doesn't read the new line for the next line.  if i put it in a list..res=[].read.append(res).print(res)...it's inserted as res[0] &amp; not res[1..x]...what i want to do is read the text file and create a new file with the columns 2,3 &amp; 4. i have 100s of auto generated files which i want to read so copy/past the values in another text file is not an viable alternative."
