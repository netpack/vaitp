"how do you divide a string in blank? i have a string in the form of ( + m1 + ""|"" + m2 + ) and ( + m1 + ""."" + m2 + ).where m1 an m2 are strings made up of ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", ""a""..these are some of the valid expressions:..""(6|7)"".""((8.7)|(6.7).(a.2))""...now my question is, if i want to split at the ""."" basically that works a a divisor, how would i do that?..what i did was tried finding a middle point but the thing is it's not always in the middle..i also tried doing s.rindex(""."") and s.index(""."") and s.find(""."") but they also don't seem to work...i was thinking of calling the outer most brackets and then work it's way inside .but i don't think that's gonna work...i am thinking there is some relation perhaps with the brackets but i just can't seem to figure out what it is..any suggestion on how do i approach this problem? or hint about how i can find that splitting point?.any help will be appreciated..thanks in advance"
