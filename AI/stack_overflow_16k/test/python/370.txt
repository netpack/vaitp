"blank - prime number else i don't understand the first else that is written. i mean it was written outside the for loop then how it is working? and when i write it inside the loop after the if statement over. the answer is going wrong. ..num = int(input(""enter a number: ""))  ..if num &gt; 1:  .   for i in range(2,num):  .       if (num % i) == 0:  .           print(num,""is not a prime number"")  .           print(i,""times"",num//i,""is"",num)  .           break  .   else:  .       print(num,""is a prime number"")  ..else:  .   print(num,""is not a prime number"")"
