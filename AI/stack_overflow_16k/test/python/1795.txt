"generating a list with a sublists and b elements in each sublist for some reason..a=4.b=3..sublists=[].p=0.while p&lt;b:.    sublists.append(0).    p+=1.list=[].p=0.while p&lt;a:.    list.append(sublists).    p+=1...is not the same as:..list=[[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]...although they print the same, but they don't work the same way... .can someone clarify if there is a difference between the lists, and which is it?"
