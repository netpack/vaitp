"blank. updating value matching on a list i have a column (row[""menuitemid""]) which contains certain numbers. if the values in that particular location matches values in another list, i want a new column to be created. so i would like to create a list that has the values {45, 46 &amp; 47} and amend the following code and replace it with the name of the list:...  this is my current code...if row[""menuitemid""] == 45 or row[""menuitemid""] == 46 or row[""menuitemid""] == 47:.            dforders.loc[x,""beef""]= 1.else:.            dforders.loc[x,""beef""]= 0....  intended output..... menuitemid   beef  .      45      1  .      55      0  .      46      1  .      46      1 ...how do i change the current code so that rather then manually specifiying the numbers with an ""or"" statement, if the location matches with any item in the list the corresponding value is updated :)"
