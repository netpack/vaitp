"the corner case of largest number at least twice of others i am taking efforts to solve largest number at least twice of others - leetcode...  .  largest number at least twice of others.  .  .  in a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element..  .  find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array..  .  if it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1..  .  example 1:..input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0].output: 1.explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,.6 is more than twice as big as x.  the index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1...  .  example 2:..input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4].output: -1.explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1...  .  note:.  .  .  nums will have a length in the range [1, 50]..  every nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 99]..  ...the condition nums will have a length in the range [1, 50],to don't need to check len(nums) ==1 and nums == none..my solution..class solution:.    def dominantindex(self, nums: list[int]) -&gt; int:.
