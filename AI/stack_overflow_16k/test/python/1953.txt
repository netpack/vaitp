"how to simplify multiple for statements in blank with relational lists i'm currently trying to simplify the below blank, because i believe that it's likely very inefficient and i'm doing it the wrong way. using sql i would just use some joins, but i'm unsure how to simplify in blank. i'm using a database of politicians, which are dictionaries (legislative body) of areas/memberships/persons (lists) which then contain the individual records (dictionaries). for every single congressional district, i want to print the name of that district, then print the respective representative. these are linked through the memberships table. is there a more efficient method to conduct this matching?..for state in housedata['areas']:.    print(state['name']).    for position in housedata['memberships']:.        if position['legislative_period_id'] == currentlegislature and state['id'] == position['area_id']:.            for person in housedata['persons']:.                if person['id'] == position['person_id']:.                    print(person['given_name'], person['family_name'])"
