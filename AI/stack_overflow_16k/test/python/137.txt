"passing numpy array as parameter in command line i am building several histograms, and i want to pass the bins parameter in command line. however, the bins may be unequally spaced sometimes, so i would prefer to pass the numpy function directly to command like, this:..blank test.py arr=np.arange(0,10,2)..or some other numpy array or matrix. my code can read what happens after the = sign, so in this case i have something like..kwargs['arr'] = 'np.arange(0,10,2)'..so that it is read as a string. i've checked can i pass a matrix as command line input in blank with numpy? but assumes that everything is an np.array; what i want here is that it could be np.arange, or just range, or even np.array. so i'd prefer to make that string run as it is, if possible. i'd like to avoid something like..if 'np.arange' in kwargs['arr']:.    # some string manipulations here.    arr = np.arange(effective_str).elif 'range' in kwargs['arr']:.    # and so on...is there such a way?"
