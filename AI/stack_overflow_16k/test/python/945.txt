"adding zero width characters to strings i want to add a zero width character to a string, so it visually looks like there's no space, but actually i can use the blank split function on the character to separate the string into ""words""...i've searched around a lot, and apparently the equivalent of zero width space would be u200b. however, if i write a string like ""testu200btest"", it gets printed as: test?test...i also tried to add .encode(""utf-8""). but that caused weird character additions to appear in the string. i suppose because the encoding is already set to utf-8. do i have to set the encoding to something else to get the output right?..edit:..i'm actually working on a text encrypting program. as i don't want to give away where words end on first sight (to make manual decoding more difficult), i want to use an invisible char - as in the zero width space..as you can see.here., the inserted question mark means that there's been an error trying to encode the u200b char. another indication for this:..teststr = ""test""+chr(8203)+""test"".file = open(""c:\...\chartest.txt"", ""w"").file.write(teststr).file.close()...this leads to the following error:.unicodeencodingerror: 'charmap' codec can't encode character 'u200b' in position 4: character maps to ..this is possibly a console problem. which is weird, though, as the console should have full unicode support. it shouldn't be necessary to do anything to add unicode characters. besides: changing to another code page (chcp 65001, chcp 1252) doesn't fix the problem (cp 65001 is even messing with blanks traceback output, so better avoid it)...all in all i'm out of ideas. none of the mentioned characters are truly invisible. and the one which maybe would be invisible causes an encodingerror. any ideas?"
