"what's the accepted blank style for long tuples on the left-hand side of for loops? i'm traversing all combinations of many possible (very unrelated) parameters. if we have 7 such parameters, we might have something like..fruit_list = ['apple', 'banana'].letter_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].class_list = [someclass, anotherclass].list_list = ....dict_list = ....animal_list = ....language_list = .....combinations = itertools.product(fruit_list, letter_list, ...)..for i, (fruit, letter, class_, list_, dict_, animal, language) in enumerate(combinations):.    ......two questions: first, is there a more canonical way of doing this in the first place? we could have many nested for loops, but this is just as gross. second, if we're stuck with this, what style is best for breaking up the tuple in the for loop? i don't think this matches anything in pep 8."
