"projecteuler 7. 10001st prime by listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13...what is the 10 001st prime number?...k = 10001.b = 2.for i in range(2, 100000):.    if i % 2 != 0 and i % 3 != 0:.        b += 1.        if b == k:.            print(i)...i expect the output of 104743, but the actual output is 29999. why?..if k will be 6, i get the output of 13 and it's correct. but if k will be 10001, i get 29999 and it's wrong."
