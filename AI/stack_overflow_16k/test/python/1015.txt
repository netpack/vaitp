"how would i go about converting parts of a string read-in from a file to an int i started working on blank and i'm currently stuck on this concept, and its kind of hard to explain so i'll use an example...example:..i have a txt file containing:.france,210026,63929000,1.15..i have already figured out how to split the elements and add them to the list. but i want to add the numbers as floats and the country name as a string...currently what i do is:..inf = [].with open('small.txt', 'r') as inputfile:.    for line in inputfile:.        line = line.strip().        if line != '':.            info += line.split(',').print info...the output is:..['france', '210026' , '63929000', '1.15']..as you can see this is a list of strings. want i actually want is for only france to be the string, the rest should be floats. any ideas? ..thanks"
