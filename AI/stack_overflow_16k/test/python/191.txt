"blank program does not return the value bonus i'm having trouble with one of my very first programs for a blank class. this is supposed to take three values which are calculated in two different functions (one with and one without bonus). then i want to output all the results in the main function. as you can see, i'm having problems printing out the results correctly. if i input some variables that are going to return salary, bonus, base, months worked and commission, i should get all these variables back if months worked > 3 and without bonus if months worked &lt; 3. it should also subtract or add an extra value based off two other if statements...#calculate income rates with sales, bonus, comission.def income(sales):.    if (sales &gt; 1000000):.        bonus = 100000.        commission = .35.        salary = 2000 + sales + bonus + (sales * commission)..    elif(sales &gt;= 500001 and sales &lt;= 1000000):.        bonus = 5000.        commission = .28.        salary = 2000 + sales + bonus + (sales * commission)..    elif (sales &gt;= 100001 and sales &lt;= 500000):.        bonus = 1000.        commission = .15.        salary = 2000 + sales + bonus + (sales * commission)..    elif (sales &gt;= 10000 and sales &lt;= 100000):.        bonus = 0.        commission = .02.        salary = 2000 + sales + bonus + (sales * commission)..    else:.        bonus = 0.        commission = 0.        salary = 2000 + sales + bonus + (sales * commission)..    return salary.    return bonus.    return commission..#calculate income rates with sales and commission, no bonus.def calc_no_bonus(sales):.    bonus = 0.    if (sales &gt; 1000000):.        commission = .35.        salary = 2000 + sales + (sales * commission)..    elif(sales &gt;= 500001 and sales &lt;= 1000000):.        commission = .28.        salary = 2000 + sales + (sales * commission)..    elif (sales &gt;= 100001 and sales &lt;= 500000):.        commission = .15.        salary = 2000 + sales + (sales * commission)..    elif (sales &gt;= 10000 and sales &lt;= 100000):.        commission = .02.        salary = 2000 + sales + (sales * commission).    else:.        commission = 0.        salary = 2000 + sales + (sales * commission)..    return salary.    return commission..def main():.    name = input(""what is your name?
