"finding minimum value in an array of dicts i have an array like the following:..people = [{'node': 'john', 'dist': 3}, .          {'node': 'mary', 'dist': 5}, .          {'node': 'alex', 'dist': 4}]...i want to compute the minimum of all the 'dist' keys. for instance, in the above example, the answer would be 3...i wrote the following code:..min = 99999.for e in people:.    if e[dist] &lt; min:.        min = e[dist].print ""minimum is "" + str(min)...i am wondering if there is a better way to accomplish this task."
