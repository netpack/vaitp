"how to (and where) install/upgrade pip for blank? i plan on using blank in the liclipse ide to play around with ai. however i require a few libraries. the libraries can be installed with pip. they mention the commands to install and upgrade pip(e.g. blank -m pip install -u pip), however i am not sure where i should write this command anymore because it does not work in either the cmd or blank shell...is there any condition while using these commands i should think about?..thank you"
