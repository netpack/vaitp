'name': 'aaa aaa'.}...and i have an array of dict myarray that look like this : ..[.    {.        'score': 0.9, .        'surname': 'aa aa', .        'name': 'aaa aaa'.    },.    {.        'score': 0.6, .        'surname': 'bb bb', .        'name': 'bbb bbb'.    },.    ....]...i am looking for a function that will find in myarray, the element that have the same name and surname that mydict, and return the score...is there a way to achieve this without manualy itering over myarray ?"
