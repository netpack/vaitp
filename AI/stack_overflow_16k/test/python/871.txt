"can you open a headless browser with webbrowser? i was just wondering if it's possible to open a headless browser with the webbrowser module? i'm new to programming and have virtually no experience and don't even know where to look. i heard this is a good site to start. i wanted to use the webbrowser module because i'm planning to run the program on other computers and the average person doesn't have special software like chrome drivers installed on their computers, also webbrowser doesn't require a path to open a browser window. so i wanted to use it. if anyone knows any other alternative modules that can open common browsers without needing a path please say so."
