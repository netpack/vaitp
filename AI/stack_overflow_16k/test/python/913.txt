"reducing the number of conditionals in a small blank script i have been developing a small program..it works perfectly how it is but i want to make the code a bit smaller...import time, math .name= input(""enter your name: "").age= int(input(""enter your age: "")).end= ""th"".if age == 3 or age == 13 or age == 23 or age == 33 or age == 43 or age == 53 or age == 63 or age == 73 or age == 83 or age == 93:. end= ""rd""..if age == 2 or age == 22 or age == 32 or age == 42 or age == 52 or age == 62     or age == 72 or age == 82 or age == 92:. end= ""nd""..print (""your name is ""+ name + "", you are "" + str(age) + "" years old."").print (""hi "" + name + "", happy "" + str(age) + end + "" birthday!"").time.sleep(5)...i would like to have an easier way to change the 'end' to other values without having to write them all, can i have it start at 3 then do it for everything 10 more than three."
