"how to limit file to not be bigger than 1mb i have script which is looking for differences and than saving this differences to the file. it looks like that:..for line in difflib.unified_diff(new_content, old_content):.    raport.write(line)...it is working correctly for small amount data..but when i have huge amount of data, file seems to be created empty. it is probably because it is writing too much data to file? so what i would like to try is to create something that will limit file size to lets say 1mb. so if data will exceed this limit it will create another file, with let's say file.txt.2 file.txt.3 etc..do you have any idea how to bite this problem?"
