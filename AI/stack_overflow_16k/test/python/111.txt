"reading in .txt and using header string as list name i have read in a .txt file and have split those lines up into a list. this list contains header info and data. i want to use the header info to name subsequent lists. because the data contained in the original list (seen below as my_list) are all strings, it is an object which does not support item assignment. i'm trying to make new lists objects with their names defined by the strings in an existing list...i'd like for name1 and name2 to be the names of list objects to which i can append data...errors include 'str' object does not support item assignment and 'str' object has no attribute 'append'...these errors aren't unexpected, but i'm not sure how to turn this string into the name of my new list...    my_list = [line.split() for line in open(""file.txt"", ""r"") ]..    listnames = my_list[0]..    #my_list[0] = ['name1','name2']..    for i in range(1,len(my_list)):.        listnames[0].append(my_list[i][0]).        listnames[1].append(my_list[i][1])"
