"keyword arguments during function call as the definition says it is not legal to follow a keyword argument with a non-keyword argument. therefore showing an error in first printname function call. ..but as far as i know in second function call reverse= false is also keyword argument(definition: formals are bound to actuals using the name of the formal parameter)..now reverse = false is also a keyword argument &amp; it follows non-keyword arguments i.e. 'firstly', 'lastly' why it doesn't show error?..def printname(first, last, reverse):.        if reverse:.            print last, first.        else:.            print first, last..printname('firsty', last='lastly', false)      -----&gt; this shows an error .printname('firsty', 'lastly', reverse= false)  -----&gt; this doesn't why so"
