"blank: returning an instance of derived class from a base class method assume the following situation. there is a base class holding some data and a derived class which assumes that the data now has some additional characteristic which allows for running algorithm. the base class also has an algorithm that processes the data in some generic way and returns a copy which is the result of processing. now, that processing does not affect the specific characteristic of the data and therefore we can safely assume that the returned value should be of the type of the derived class. ..my current implementation:..class genericdata:..    def __init__(self, d):.        self._d = d..    def process(self):.        # process the data in a way that is compatible.        # with any specialization. then, return an instance.        # of the specific derived class..        return type(self)(some_processing(self._d))...class specificdata(genericdata):..    """"""this class is just a gathering of algorithms that make.       certain assumptions about d.""""""..    def __init__(self, d):.        super().__init__(d)..    def algorithm():.        # do some stuff assuming certain characteristic of data.        pass...my question is: is this a good/blankic way of handling such a case? the answer to that question could be either a different design pattern or a better implementation of the pattern used above."
