"how to find the nth prime number faster? i just started to learn how to program and i was trying to make a program to find the nth prime number. and i did it. but it takes a very long time for large number. is there a way to make it faster? here's the code i used(it's really basic):..def prime_finder(nth1):.   s = 1.   n = 0.   while n &lt; nth1:.       s += 1.       for x in range(2,s):.          if s % x == 0:.             break.       else:.          n += 1..   return s..print prime_finder(31337)"
