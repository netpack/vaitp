"how to change a dictionary key into a value i have been trying to user beautiful soup to parse a website and get necessary data. now that i have the data i want to use pandas to organize the data but for that i want to make a well-structured dictionary...the data that i have scraped and cleaned up is in the dictionary data_dict. here, the keys are the names of the turtles and the values are some information about the corresponding turtle...data_dict = {'aesop': ['age: 7 years old', 'weight: 6 lbs', 'sex: female', 'breed: african aquatic sideneck turtle', 'source: found in lake erie'], 'caesar': ['age: 2 years old', 'weight: 4 lbs', 'sex: male', 'breed: greek tortoise', 'source: hatched in house'], 'sulla': ['age: 1 year old', 'weight: 1 lb', 'sex: male', 'breed: african aquatic sideneck turtle', 'source: found in lake erie']}....now, i wanted the keys of this dictionary to be something like ""turtle_1"" and the next one ""turtle_2"" and so on. so i wrote the code: ..name_num = 1.for name in list(data_dict.keys()):.    data_dict[""turtle_""+str(name_num)] = data_dict.pop(name).    name_num += 1...this changed the keys from ""aesop"".... (and so on) to ""turtle_1"".... and so on. now i want the name of the turtle (that was previously the key) to be a value of the corresponding key. i want data_dict to look something like this: ..data_dict = {'turtle_1': ['age: 7 years old', 'weight: 6 lbs', 'sex: female', 'breed: african aquatic sideneck turtle', 'source: found in lake erie', 'name: aesop'], 'turtle_2': ['age: 2 years old', 'weight: 4 lbs', 'sex: male', 'breed: greek tortoise', 'source: hatched in house', 'name: caesar'], 'turtle_3': ['age: 1 year old', 'weight: 1 lb', 'sex: male', 'breed: african aquatic sideneck turtle', 'source: found in lake erie', 'name: sulla']}...so, the keys get a new value which is the name of each turtle. thanks and i really appreciate your help."
