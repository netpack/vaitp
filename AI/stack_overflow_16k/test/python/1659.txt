"max method of a list consisting of strings i am wondering why the result is '4' if i write the following code:..lists = ['1','2','3','4'].print(max(lists)).lists.append(5).print(max(lists))...i suppose that the max method of lists converts from str to int first and then gives me the max of ints in the first couple of lines, but this seems untrue if i try the next lines. can anyone explain this?"
