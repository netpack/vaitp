"initial directory for os.walk() i'm trying to use os.walk() to print out all the files in a directory and its subdirectories. this is what i wrote:..def usewalk():.   for root, dirname, filename in os.walk(""/""):.       print filename...i don't know what i should use as the directory for os.walk(). that is, i'm not sure what i should include in the parentheses. i thought if i used ""/"", it would start from the directory that the file is in, but it printed out files that are not in it, such as ""['.dbfseventsd', '.ds_store', '.file', '.hotfiles.btree', 'mach_kernel']"". it seems to me that it is starting from the default directory of blank?"
