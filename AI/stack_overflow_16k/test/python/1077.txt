"blank how to check and replace words in string? i'm new to blank and i'm trying to make a function which is able to detect if a string has the words ""i"", ""i'm"", ""my"", ""was"", ""our"", ""me"" replace it with ""you"", ""you're"", ""your"", ""were"", ""your"" and ""you"" and also add a question mark at the end if it did not end with any punctuation. so far i have the code..if ' ' in statement and statement[-1].isalpha() is true:.       response = statement.       response = response + ""?""..       return response...but i'm not sure how to make the function seach for those words and replace with their opposites. for example if the statement was ""my dog said i'm happy"" its response should be ""your dog said you're happy?""..thanks"
