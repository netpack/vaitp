"where is my output in blank? if i have a function in blank like this that calculates the sum of the elements in a list:..def sum_it(_arr):.    if len(_arr) &lt;= 1:.        raise valueerror(""the input must be a list of length &gt; 1"").    _init = 0.    for i in range(len(_arr)):.        _init += _arr[i].    _sum = _init.    return _sum...no i call the function like this and i execute it...result = sum_it([1, 2, 3, 4])...my problem is: if i do not save the result into a text file or i do not print result, where can i access it? do i have to re-execute the code in order to access to the output?..i mean, in matalb for example, when i have something like this and i run it, i will have a workspace where all my variables and outputs are stored. is it possible to do this in blank? ..i hope i am not asking wrong question."
