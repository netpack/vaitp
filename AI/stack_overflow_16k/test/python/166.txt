"working with dictionary or lists blank i have a the following statement ..onehot  = collection.defaultdict(list)...that i fill with  two dimentional vector..when i print onehot here is what i get:..print(onehot).---&gt;defaultdict&lt;class'list'&gt;,{0:['1200',1],1:['1203',2],2:['1400',4]}...which is perfect . now my question is is there a way to get the 'paired' value from onehot . for example: ..onehot 1200 ---&gt; 1 .onehot 1800 ---&gt; 32 ...i'm newbie to blank so i'm not sure about it. ..update.the problem is that i don't really know where 1200 is in the list, so i want and  i'm interested  in the number in  the 2nd dimension..so  i need to the the list look for 1200 and return the values of the 2nd dimension which in this case is 1"
