"blank file reader convert invalid literal i have been trying to make blank code that reads a text file makes it a variable and sends it using i2c. heres the code:..import serial.import smbus.import time.import sys..from time import sleep....# for rpi version 1, use ""bus = smbus.smbus(0)"".bus = smbus.smbus(1)..# this is the address we setup in the arduino program.address = 0x04..loopvar = 1..while loopvar == 1:.    text_file = open(""./pb_vision/command.txt"", ""r"").    print text_file.read().    visioncommando = text_file.read().    print visioncommando..    def writenumber(value):.        bus.write_byte(address, value).        bus.write_byte_data(address, 0, value).        return -1..    var = int(visioncommando).    writenumber(var).    print (""rpi: hi arduino, i sent you"").    print (var)..    text_file.close()...when i run this, i get this as output;..110..traceback (most recent call last):. file ""testai.py"", line 29, in &lt;module&gt;.  var = int(visioncommando).valueerror: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''...any suggestion, fixes?..anyways thanks in advance...thanks your suggestions worked, one step closer  to an working project."
