"printing to stdout or file without repeating code i'm writing a function in blank with the following signature..def print_results(input_file, output=none)...the parameter input_file is just a text file, as is output. if an output file is provided, i want to write the results there. otherwise, i want to print them to the standard output...i'd like to do this in such a way where i do not have to repeat code. as of now, the function looks something like this:..def print_results(input_file, output=none):.    // do some computation.    if output:.        with open(output) as out:.            // print results to output file.    else:.        // print results to standard output...is there any way to merge the parts where i'm printing the results so that it only needs to be done once?"
