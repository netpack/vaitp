"how to import content from a text file and add them to variables i have a settings file for a monopoly like game i'm making, the settings file has parameters like the number of people playing and whatnot, i would like to know how to import the settings from that text file and bring it into different variables, for example, having number of players in the settings file go to a numplayers variable in the actual code so i can use it for other games and also usee the settings in the code..this is my code: ..    def inputs(line, typeinp=none, start=none, end=none):.        while true:.            string = input(line).            if typeinp != none:.                try:.                    if typeinp == ""string"":.                        string = str(string).                    elif typeinp == ""integer"":.                        string = int(string).                    if start != none and end != none:.                        while not (string &gt;= start and string &lt;= end):.                            print(""please input a number between"", str(start) + ""-"" + str(end)).                            string = int(input(line)).                    break.                except:.                    print(""plese input a"", typeinp).            else:.                break.        return string...    # settings file, if user chooses to run setup this is all the setup questions...    def gamesettingssetup():.        settingscheck = open(""settings.txt"", ""r"").        print(""lets setup"").        # int setup questions.        numplayers = str(inputs('how many real players are playing: ', ""integer"")).        numaiplayers = str(inputs('how many ai players will be playing?: ', ""integer"")).        ailevel = str(inputs(""what ai difficulty level would you like?
