"blank - finding the average of scores of a list in a list i'm trying to find the average scores of a list in a list, using lambda...scores=[['james','q',3,4,1,5],['kat','s',3,4,1,2],['john','g',3,5,6,4]['erikson','g',3,7,6,8],['filip','nj',3,8,9,9]].sortedscores=sorted(scores,key=lambda score:avg(score[3:],reverse=false))..for i in scores:.    print(i[0:1],avg(i[3:]))...avg is not a command, so what would be the best way to calculate the average within this code?"
