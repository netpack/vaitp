"find next immediate line with string (after finding a first string) i'm trying to scrape some information out of a large text file and ran into a bit of a problem. ..there are several items in this file that have the start_needle as an id, but they are out of order. the end_needle is the string that denotes the end of the item. i am able to get the starting point, but how would i pull the line where the next immediate instance of the end_needle occurs? ..basically, ""find the next instance of end_needle after start_needle""..start_needle = '725160001'.end_needle = '* * end item * *'..filename = 'las3300combined.txt'.target = open('file.txt', 'w')..start_list = []..with open(filename) as myfile:.    for num, line in enumerate(myfile, 1):.        if start_needle in line:.            start_list.append(num)"
