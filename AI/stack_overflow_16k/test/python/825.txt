"simplifying code: classes as simple containers in blank i am trying to write a function drag which can be called as drag('object1').to('object2'). the code below works as i want, but it seems using a class simply as a container may be unnecessary:..def drag(source):.    class container:.        def to(self, target):.            print 'dragging ' + source + ' to ' + target..    return container()...can the above code be simplified?"
