"blank: how do i take an imported text file with a list of names, two column format, and put them in blank sorted alphabetically? this is what i have so far and its giving me errors when sort(), sorted() are used..i have to import the names and print them..sort the names and print them again...the text file is formatted in two columns and is from notepad..riggs, jerry.stone, ruby.wood, holly.dover, ilene.funt, ella.storm, wayne.lowe, lyle.free, bjorn.caine, candy.carr, rex.downs, mark.twain, lionel.thorn, rose.shore, rocky.bush, rose.waters, muddy.graves, doug.stone, roxanne.rivers, wade.banks, rob.carr, rusty.trout, brooke.carr, rhoda.apple, adam.ponds, lily.burns, forest.dover, ben.sales, clarence.nichol, penny.beech, sandy...i just can't get it to alphabetically sort the names or how to go about doing it. the desired outcome is that it will print the same style as the text file, in two columns. ..def main():.    infile = open('names.txt','r').    str = infile.read().    print(str).    name = str..    for name in str:.        ch = 'x'.        print(name)..    #for line in str:.        #str = line.readlines().        #print(line)..    name = input('who are you looking for? (case sensitive):') .    if name in str:.        print(name,'was found in the list').    else:.        print(name,'was not found in the list').    infile.close()..main()"
