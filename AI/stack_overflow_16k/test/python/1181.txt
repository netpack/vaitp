"how do you iteratre over a list performing some operation that turns a single element into multiple? i have a csv file of data from a lidar sensor that looks like this, but with a bagillion more lines:..scan_0,scan_1,scan_2.timestamp_0,timestamp_1,timestamp_2.7900200,7900225,7900250.logtime_0,logtime_1,logtime_2.27:46.8,27:46.8,27:46.8.distance_0,distance_0,distance_0.132,141,139.136,141,155.139,141,155.138,143,155.138,143,142.139,143,136.138,143,136...this is data from a planar sensor. so scan_0 is a list or ""radial"" coordinates for the specific scan at a time stamp. ..my plan is to:...read the csv file into a list.transpose the list.turn each element of row into a xyz format like the example below...scan_0 -----&gt; scan_0.timestamp_0-&gt; timestamp_0.7900200-----&gt; 7900200.logtime_0---&gt; logtime_0.27:46.8-----&gt; 27:46.8.distance_0--&gt; distance_0.132---------&gt; [132*cos(1),132*sin(1),7900200].136---------&gt; [136*cos(2),136*sin(2),7900200].139---------&gt; [139*cos(3),139*sin(3),7900200].138---------&gt;          .          ..138---------&gt;          .          ..139---------&gt;          .          ..138---------&gt; [138*cos(7),139*sin(7),7900200]..write the array of xyz coordinates to a new csv file with one coordinate per line'.eventually use a trajectory instead of timestamp for the z coordinate from another csv file....i tell you all of this, so you have some context for my motivation. ..here is what i have so far:..import csv .import numpy.from numpy import genfromtxt.from numpy import vsplit.import math..with open('2016_09_16_14_29_09_953.csv',""r"") as f:.    reader = csv.reader(f,delimiter = "","").    data = list(reader).    row_count = len(data).print row_count.with open(""out.csv"", ""a"") as f1:.    my_r = genfromtxt('2016_09_16_14_29_09_953.csv', delimiter=',', skip_header=6, autostrip=true) #import data.    my_r = my_r.t #transpose.    for x in my_r:.        i=0.        while i &lt; row_count/360:.            x = [x*math.cos(i), x*math.sin(i), i].            i = i + row_count/360..    thedatawriter = csv.writer(f1) #setup writer.    for row in my_r: #write the data.        thedatawriter.writerow(row)...all this really does it ouput the transpose of the source file. it appears that i am having trouble turning the single entry in the list into a list itself. what am i doing wrong here? any help, advice, and guidance is greatly appreciated."
