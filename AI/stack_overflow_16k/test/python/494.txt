"how to prevent downloading html/text pages as .png http://puu.sh/3krct.png..my program generates random links to a service that hosts images, and it grabs and downloads random images. the program makes a lot of requests, and so it has to go through proxies...well, when the program is started, i just give it the path to a fresh large proxy list; however, sometimes the proxies will not connect to the website and sometimes they will return a custom html page - or the image service will return the message on the page ""you don't have permission to view this image."" although, the program will still save the request and download the page with a .png extension..and so sometimes those html/text pages are saved as .png files:..http://puu.sh/3krxm.png..http://puu.sh/3krgn.png..is there any way i can prevent the downloading of these pages, and only download the actual images?..thank you...if self.proxy != false:.    #make our requests go through proxy.    self.opener.retrieve(url, filename).else:.    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)"
