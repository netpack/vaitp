"how to transform floats to integers in a list i have the code below which takes a list of coefficients which are floats and i want to turn the ones that are actually integers, to integers (for example 2.0 i want to become just 2)...so i have the code below and the output of the 3 print functions are: .[ 0.   0.  -0.   0.  -0.  -0.  -0.   0.   0.5  0. ],..0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0...and .[ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.5  0. ]..so based on the printing, it enters the ""if"" statements, which means it confirms that my coefficients are actually integers (i have also tried ""is_integer"" function, getting the same result), but for some reason it doesn't convert them to integers. can somebody help me with this? thank you!..def function(coeffs):    .    coeffs = np.round(coeffs,2).    print(coeffs).    for w in range(len(coeffs)):.        if coeffs[w]-int(coeffs[w])==0.0:.            coeffs[w] = int(coeffs[w]).            print(coeffs[w]).    print(coeffs)"
