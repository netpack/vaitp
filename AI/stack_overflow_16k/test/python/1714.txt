"bidirectional connection between objects in blank is there any smart way in blank to make bidirectional connections between objects?.it's many-to-many type of connection. take a look at this sample picture:....all of the objects visible on the picture are also objects in my program. .what i would like to achieve is that whenever i do something like print(object.connetions) i get a list of all connected objects..so looking at the sample picture when i do print(n2.connections) it lists r6,jolie etc. similarly print(ab.connections) prints p1...3, p8..0. ..what i currently implemented is one-way connection using list(), so that i am only able to print connections of ab object - it stores all connected objects(p1...3, p8..0) in a list...i know that one of the possible solutions is to add such a connection lists to all objects, but it would require two lists and two append() operations for every single connection...do you now any other smart method to implement such functionality?"
