"blank if and else statements calculating employees pay i'm having a little trouble with this assignment its about calculating the employees pay it goes like  write a blank program that prompts the user for an hourly rate and a number of hours worked and computes a pay amount. any hours worked over 40 are paid at time and a half (1.5 times the normal hourly rate). write a version of the program  using the if/else my code so far is this ..hours = int(input('how many hours did you work? ')).rate = 1.50.rate = (hours/2)+hours*(rate+1.5).if hours&lt;40:. print(""you earn"",rate)"
