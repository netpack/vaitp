convert an integer into 32bit binary blank i am trying to make a program that converts a given integer(limited by the value 32 bit int can hold) into 32 bit binary number. for example 1 should return (000..31times)1. i have been searching the documents and everything but haven't been able to find some concrete way. i got it working where number of bits are according to the number size but in string. can anybody tell a more efficient way to go about this?
