"why is this saying that the object is not subscriptable (blank) i'm trying to write a code that will detect if a list is a palindrome. here is what i have so far-..##thesublist = raw_input(""input the list here"").def ispalindrome( thesublist ) :.    return thesublist == thesublist[::-1]...why does this tell me that the ""int"" object is not subscriptable. the only way i can get this to run is by putting the top line in (the commented out part) but i don't want to have to do that, everything should come from just the ispalindrome( thesublist ). ..any ideas?..thanks."
