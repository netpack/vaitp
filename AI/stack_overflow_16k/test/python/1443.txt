"does blank repeatedly calculate value of function appear multiple times in one formula in blank, if i have a function..f(x)=(g(x)+1)(g(x))..g(x) is defined before and takes time to calculate. ..some thing like this..def g(x):.  return value.def f(x):.  return (g(x)+1)*(g(x))...when i am calculating f(x), will blank calculate g(x) two times when substitute g(x) in to the equation? .if it does calculate two times, how people usually handle it in blank?"
