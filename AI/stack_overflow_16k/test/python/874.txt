"blank: naming dictionary from list data i am trying to create dictionaries based on a variables in a list. ..why? i have a bunch of sites and thought it would be best to save the necessary data to individual json files and when a site is called for further evaluation to have a single site file called instead of a huge dictionary with all sites.  ..example:..mylist = ['site1','site2','site3']..for new_dict in mylist:..    temp_dict = {} .    # gather data to temp_dict.    temp_dict['mickjagger'] = {}.    temp_dict['mickjagger'] = ['useless information'].    globals()[new_dict] = temp_dict # use global to 'rename temp to new...many smart folks say you shouldn't do this. i say, do what is necessary."
