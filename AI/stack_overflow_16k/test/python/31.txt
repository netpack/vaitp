"i cannot complete page 246 of blank data analytics. the last four lines of code always produce ""invalid syntax"" i am in the process of completing an assignment in blank that requires me to copy the code in a book ""starting at in[7]"". however, when i attempt to do so, i am informed that the ""&lt;"" in  in ""invalid syntax"". i have underwent numerous attempts to resolve the issue as shown below, but i always get an error of some sort. what is the correct way to write this?!..attempt 1 and how it is supposed to look;..in [7]: t = np.arange(0,2.5,0.1)....: y1 = np.sin(math.pi*t)....: y2 = np.sin(math.pi*t+math.pi/2)....: y3 = np.sin(math.pi*t-math.pi/2).in [8]: plt.plot(t,y1,'b*',t,y2,'g^',t,y3,'ys').out[8]:.[&lt;matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbd2e48&gt;,. &lt;matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbe10b8&gt;,. &lt;matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbe15c0&gt;]...the result of attempt 1 as shown above....attempt 2;..in [7]: t = np.arange(0,2.5,0.1)....: y1 = np.sin(math.pi*t)....: y2 = np.sin(math.pi*t+math.pi/2)....: y3 = np.sin(math.pi*t-math.pi/2).in [8]: plt.plot(t,y1,'b*',t,y2,'g^',t,y3,'ys').out[8]: [&lt;matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbd2e48&gt;,. &lt;matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbe10b8&gt;,. &lt;matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbe15c0&gt;]...the result of attempt 2 as shown above....attempt 3;..in [7]: t = np.arange(0,2.5,0.1)....: y1 = np.sin(math.pi*t)....: y2 = np.sin(math.pi*t+math.pi/2)....: y3 = np.sin(math.pi*t-math.pi/2).in [8]: plt.plot(t,y1,'b*',t,y2,'g^',t,y3,'ys').out[8]: [matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbd2e48,. matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbe10b8,. matplotlib.lines.line2d at 0xcbe15c0]...the result of attempt 3 as shown above.....finally, the code that i am expected to duplicate (i import pyplot, math, and numpy in a previous cell as part of the project requirements)..i've looked for a solution for a long time but i can't find anything useful. does anyone know what to do?"
