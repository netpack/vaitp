"blank: changing .py file to .exe i need some help with changing .py file to .exe file. i am trying to do it with cx_freeze module, i managed to do the setup.py file, the only problem is, i dont know what should i put in my command prompt?..setup.py file looks like this:..import sys.from cx_freeze import setup, executable..# dependencies are automatically detected, but it might need fine tuning..build_exe_options = {""include_files"": [""postevanka.ui,beep.wav,gang.wav""]}..base = none.if sys.platform == ""win32"":.    base = ""win32gui""..setup(  name = ""po≈°tevanka"",.        version = ""0.1"",.        description = ""postevanka"",.        options = {""build_exe"": build_exe_options},.        executables = [executable(""postevanka.py"", base=base)])"
