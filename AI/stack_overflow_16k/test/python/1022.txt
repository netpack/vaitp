"popen launch window on screen i currently have the below code which launches a bat file, waits a few seconds, and then enters a command into the bat window. this currently is working...    # find bat file to open (named echo_test.bat).    os.chdir(target_dir).    target = [x for x in os.listdir('.') if 'echo_test' in x][0].    print target.    # open file, wait, and write ""test"" to it.    p = popen('{}'.format(target), stdin=pipe, stdout=pipe).    time.sleep(2).    p.stdin.write('test').    time.sleep(4).    sys.exit(0)...how can i have the initial bat file that i open launch interactively on the screen? i've tried passing /k to it but it's not doing anything. i seem to be missing something."
