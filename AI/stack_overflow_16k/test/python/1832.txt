"date ordinal output? i'm wondering if there is a quick and easy way to output ordinals given a number in blank...for example, given the number 1, i'd like to output ""1st"", the number 2, ""2nd"", et cetera, et cetera...this is for working with dates in a breadcrumb trail..home &gt;  venues &gt;  bar academy &gt;  2009 &gt;  april &gt;  01 ...is what is currently shown..i'd like to have something along the lines of..home &gt;  venues &gt;  bar academy &gt;  2009 &gt;  april &gt;  1st"
