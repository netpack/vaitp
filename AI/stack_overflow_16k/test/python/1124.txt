"trouble parsing csv file - can't read it 2 times super noob here, so this might be a little embarrasing..i need to work with a csv file, and found that you can use csv.dictreader to make a list of ordered dicts. so far so good..i can loop through the list and do stuff, but only one time..if i want to print the dicts 2 times, it doesn´t work...import csv.csv_file = open('untitled2.csv', mode='r').csv_reader = csv.dictreader(csv_file, delimiter = "";"")..    for rows in csv_reader:.        print (rows)..    for rows in csv_reader:.        print (rows)...this only prints the list of dicts 1 time. i need to go through the list a number of times. but i´m not able to do that."
