"how to write an object to a tempfile in blank i want to write an object to a tempfile in blank...import tempfile..clip = clip() // dynamic generated from ffmpeg.buffer = tempfile.spooledtemporaryfile(max_size = 1024*1).buffer.write(clip).buffer.seek(0)...the content is an object and it is not a string type. how can it be implemented? thanks..for example, this content is a movie clip. after creating a clip object, i want to upload it to a server. then, delete it from memory."
