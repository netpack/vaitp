"blank file.read() method i'm reading a text file, line by line, using blank.  each line is of a variable length.  the first line could be 10 characters, the next one could be 100; there's no way of telling.  presently, i issue a file.readline() method for each line, process it, and then save it to a database.  this method guarantees me one full line of input.  i'd like to do this faster however.  is there a way to do a bulk read using the blank file.read() method such that i can guarantee an end-of-line read character when the buffer stops in the middle of a line?  what's the best way to handle this?"
