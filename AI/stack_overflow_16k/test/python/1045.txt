"comparing elements between elements in two lists of tuples here is what i am looking to do.i have two list of tuples. build a list of elements such that the first element in a tuple in list1 matches the first element in a tuple in list 2..list1 = [('a', 2), ('b', 3), ('z', 5)]..list2 = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]..list3 = ['a','b']...note: there can be no duplicate first elements..after looking at blank list comprehensions, this is what i have done ..[x[0] for x in list1 if (x[0] in [y[0] for y in list2])]...my questions is would this be how an experienced blank programmer would code this up? having coded this up myself i still find this fairly hard to read. if not how else would you do it"
