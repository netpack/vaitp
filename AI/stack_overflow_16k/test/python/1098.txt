"blank variable value reset out of loop i have written the following code in a programming exercise:..q = lenp[0]*[lenp[1]*[0.]] # empty 2d array.for i in range(lenp[0]):.    for j in range(lenp[1]):.        hit = (z == colors[i][j]).        q[i][j] = (hit * sensor_right + (1-hit) * (1.-sensor_right)) * p[i][j]...the value of every element q[i][j] is correctly set if i test for it inside the loop. but, if i print any q[i][j] outside of the loop, it has reverted to its initial value of 0. i think i have missed something in the management of blank references to object, but what would that be ?..in a normal setting i would have used numpy for the array and be done with it, but this is a code for an udacity course (ia for robotics, very interesting by the way) and one is not allowed to import anything."
