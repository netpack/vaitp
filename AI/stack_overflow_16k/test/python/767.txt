"storing items within a dictionary to be then used to calculate area i'm pretty new to blank (2 days) and i'm struggling to find a solution to add a variable to a dictionary with a defined value as well as .. choice = input("""").    if choice == ""1"":.        print (""1.basic - £8"").        print (""2.standard- £13"").        print (""3.premium- £25"").....        premium = dict(name =""premium"",.                       cost = 25.0)..        standard = dict(name =""standard"",.                       cost = 13.0)..        basic = dict(name =""basic"",.                       cost = 8.0)....        grass_dict = {}...        premium = input(""type premium"")...        basic = print(input(""type '3' for basic"")..        grass_dict['1'] = premium...        grass_dict['2'] = standard....        grass_dict['3'] = basic.....i have then tried to add the variables to the second part of the code so that when i reference the cost calculation i will be able to use the stored variable and it's value (25.0) to be used...elif (choice ==""2""):..  time.sleep(0.2).print(""-"")..time.sleep(0.2).print(""-"")..print(""2.select area of grass"").print(""1.select shape required"")..if (choice ==""1""):.        print(""grass calculation program"").        print(""select shape required"").        print(""1.square"").        print(""2.triangle"").        print(""3.circle"")...shape = input (""please select (1/2/3)"")..if choice ==""1"":.    length = input (""please enter length"").    width = input (""please enter width"").    area = (length*width)...    print (""calculating cost"")...elif choice ==""2"":.    length = input (""please enter length"").    width = input (""please enter width"")...thanks for everyone's help!"
