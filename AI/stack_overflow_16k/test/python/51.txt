"i have issues with printing out the array in a function i am trying to make a tictactoe game for my school project. i am using pycharm and somehow inside the print_board function, i get red lines under the board[0]. it seems like it can't get the board elements inside the function. how can i print the board elements inside print_board function?..class tictactoe:..    board = [0, 1, 2,.             3, 4, 5,.             6, 7, 8]..    def print_board(self):.        print(board[0])"
