"confusion with split function in blank i am trying to alphabetically sort the words from a file. however, the program sorts the lines, not the words, according to their first words. here it is...fname = raw_input(""enter file name: "").fh = open(fname).lst = list().for line in fh:.    lst2 = line.strip().    words = lst2.split().    lst.append(words).    lst.sort().print lst...here is my input file..but soft what light through yonder window breaks .it is the east and juliet is the sun .arise fair sun and kill the envious moon .who is already sick and pale with grief...and this is what i'm hoping to get..['arise', 'but', 'it', 'juliet', 'who', 'already', 'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief', 'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft', 'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window', 'with', 'yonder']"
