"after parsing url as json, can't return a specific element from list- only whole list all,..i wrote the following code:..import requests,bs4.res=requests.get('http://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=551798799').res.raise_for_status().wwe=bs4.beautifulsoup(res.text).print wwe.select('p averageuserrating')...if i only do: print wwe.select('p') then the code works, but it prints everything in the list. however when i print what is in the output above, this throws an error saying the selector is unsupported...i am basically only trying to return the averageuserrating value (which is 4.0)..thanks for the help!"
