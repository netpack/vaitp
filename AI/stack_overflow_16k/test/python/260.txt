"blank json.dumps and json.loads before dynamodb insertion is there any way to populate an empty string at any position (without knowing the json's structure) in a json received from a certain endpoint before inserting it into dynamodb? as you all know it has issues with floats that you must transform them into decimals, but can't seem to figure out an easy way to populate the empty string such as ""full_name"": """" with a value like ""n/a""...i'm looking for something like json.loads(json.dumps(data), parse_float=decimal), as for the parse_float thing but for empty strings. something clean and easy to use. i've seen you can use a custom cls class for that but i don't quite get it how to do it properly especially without knowing the structure of the json which might vary...json example:..{.  ""campaign_id"": ""9c1c6cd7-fd4d-480b-8c80-07091cdd4103"",.  ""creation_date"": 1530804132,.  ""objects"": [.     {.        ""id"": 12345,.        ""full_name"": """".     },.     ....  ],.  ....}"
