"returning a print statement still shows the value i tested the following code:..in [266]: def foo(): .     ...:     print(""yes"") .     ...:                                                                                                         ..in [267]: def bar(): .     ...:     return foo() .     ...:                                                                                                         ..in [268]: bar()                                                                                                   .yes..in [269]: x = bar()                                                                                               .yes...i am very puzzled about the result, it act as ..in [274]: def foo(): .     ...:     return print(""yes %.1f"" %12.333) .     ...:      .     ...:                                                                                                         ..in [275]: foo()                                                                                                   .yes 12.3...how should i understand this? much like shell script shell's command substitution echo $(ls)"
