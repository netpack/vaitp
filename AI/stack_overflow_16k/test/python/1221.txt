"how to remove spaces/hashes from a string and replace them with hashes at a particular length? i would like to change the string of numbers in a way that all extra spaces and hashes will be removed and the output will have a proper string with hashes at the right length. it must be after every 3rd digit unless the remaining length of the string is 2 or 4...the code i tried with is able to give me half of the result, i am not able to write a code where the remaining length of the string is 4 and then divide them into 2 with a hash in between. it divides remaining 4 also into 3 and 1. e.g - 1234 must be 12-34 not 123-1...def solution(s):.    # this will remove all extra spaces and hashes.    number = """".join(s.split()).replace('-','').    return '-'.join(number[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(number), 3))...print(solution(""00-44  48 5555 8361"")) # output is 004-448-555-583-61.print(solution(""0 - 22 1985--324"")) # output is 022-198-532-4 (not expected)...output must be like below:..print(solution(""00-44  48 5555 8361"")) # expected o/p - 004-448-555-583-61.print(solution(""0 - 22 1985--324"")) # expected o/p -  022-198-53-24"
