"read a file in byte chunks using blank i am trying to convert a file containing more than 1 billion bytes into integers. obviously, my machine cannot do this at once so i need to chunk my code. i was able to decode the first 50,000,000 bytes but i am wondering how to read the integers in the file that are between 50,000,001 and 100,000,000, 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 etc. the following is what i have now;the range function is not working with this. ..import struct.with open(x, ""rb"") as f:.    this_chunk = range(50000001, 100000000).    data = f.read(this_chunk).    ints1 = struct.unpack(""i"" * (this_chunk //4) , data).    print(ints1)"
