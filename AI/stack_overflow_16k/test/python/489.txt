"trying to return numbers in a list i have a few questions about this code here.  what i'm trying to do is write a function that takes 2 inputs, a list and an option, which the option is either 0 or 1, and returns a list of numbers in the list.  if the option is 0, it will return numbers that are greater than 5 or less than -5.  if the option is 1, it will return a list of all the odd numbers on the first list.  this is what i have for code right now:..def splitlist(mylist, option):.    nlist = [].    for element in range(0,len(mylist)):.        if option == 0:.            if mylist[element] &gt; 5:.                nlist.append(element).    return nlist...right now i got it to return a list of if the elements are greater than 5, but it returns where they are in the list, not the actually value.  say i ran the program..splitlist([-6,4,7,8,3], 0)...it would return.    [2, 3]..i want it too return the values of 7 and 8 and also -6 but i know i don't have the right code to return -6 as of now.  can someone guide me in the right direction.  also, i want to be using a for loop here.  also i have no clue how to return odd numbers if the option is 1...here is my code which works:..def splitlist(mylist, option):.    nlist = [].    for element in mylist:.        if option == 0:.            if abs(element) &gt; 5:.                nlist.append(element).        elif option == 1:.            if element % 2:.                nlist.append(element).    return nlist...how would i be able to switch this to a while loop?.i tried the following code but it does not seem to work:..def splitlist2(mylist, option):.    nlist = [].    element = 0 .    while element &lt; len(mylist):.        if option == 0:.            if abs(element) &gt; 5:.                nlist.append(element).        elif option == 1:.            if element % 2:.                nlist.append(element).        element = element + 1.    return nlist"
