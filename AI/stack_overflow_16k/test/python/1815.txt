"how would i check if 'a' is in 'b'? need assistance i'm tasked with doing this assignment in class, (i'm making code that checks if a password a user puts in follows guidelines)...a portion of this requires me to check if for example a is in b, but i'm having trouble. here's a portion of the code, how would i check if an uppercase letter is in the password inputted? sorry, i'm new to blank and i'm trying to learn new concepts!..i looked online but what people are saying to put is a bit to complicated for me (as of now)...def valid_password(pw):.    up = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxwy'.    if pw in up.      return true"
