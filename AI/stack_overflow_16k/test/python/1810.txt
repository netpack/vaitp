"how would i check if a word or sentence is a palindrome? i am supposed to check if a word or sentence is a palindrome using code, and i was able to check for words, but i'm having trouble checking sentences as being a palindrome. here's my code, it's short but i'm not sure how else to add it to check for sentence palindromes. i'm sort of a beginner at blank, and i've already looked at other people's code, and they are too complicated for me to really understand. here's what i wrote:..def is_palindrome(s):.  if s[::1] == s[::-1]:.    return true.  else:.    return false...here is an example of a sentence palindrome: ""red roses run no risk, sir, on nurses order."" (if you ignore spaces and special characters)"
