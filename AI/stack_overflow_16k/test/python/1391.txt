"understanding builtin next() function i read the documentation on next() and i understand it abstractly. from what i understand, next() is used as a reference to an iterable object and makes blank cycle to the next iterable object sequentially. makes sense! my question is, how is this useful outside the context of the builtin for loop? when would someone ever need to use next() directly? can someone provide a simplistic example? thanks mates!"
