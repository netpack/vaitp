"processing a for loop with an error i have a for loop which has an error in it.  ..try:.    for line in text:.        'do stuff'.except:.    pass...when the error occurs blank just exits the for loop.  i can't get blank to ignore the error and keep iterating through the loop.  incidentally, it is a text file and i am looping through the lines. i should also point out that the error does not occur in the do stuff part, it literally occurs in the for loop.  i also frankly don't understand why the error is being thrown since the line is just like any other line.  i tried deleting the line to see if it was just a one time thing but the next line has an error in it too which leads me to believe that i cannot just delete bad lines. the name of the error is unicodedecodeerror..here's the text:..https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9zzw6-3m2qgvfrtbzlxms0tvuu/view?usp=sharing..i'm trying to make a list of all the words that follow the word 'abstract'..here's the actual code..with open(full_path_of_old_file) as old:..for i, line in enumerate(old):...    if ""abstract,"" not in line:.        b = line.find('abstract').        line2 = line[b+9:].        list1 = line2.split().        list1[0] = list1[0].replace("","","""").        list1[0] = list1[0].replace(""."", """").        try:.            if list1[0][-1] == ""s"":.                list1[0] = list1[0][:-1].        except:.            pass.        objects_of_abstract.append(list1[0])...here's the full traceback..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""/applications/pycharm ce.app/contents/helpers/pydev/pydevd.py"", line 1596, in &lt;module&gt;.    globals = debugger.run(setup['file'], none, none, is_module).  file ""/applications/pycharm ce.app/contents/helpers/pydev/pydevd.py"", line 1023, in run.    pydev_imports.execfile(file, globals, locals)  # execute the script.  file ""/applications/pycharm ce.app/contents/helpers/pydev/_pydev_imps/_pydev_execfile.py"", line 18, in execfile.    exec(compile(contents+""n"", file, 'exec'), glob, loc).  file ""/users/kylefoley/pycharmprojects/inference_engine2/inference2/proofs/z_natural_language.py"", line 25, in &lt;module&gt;.    for i, line in enumerate(old):.  file ""/library/frameworks/blank.framework/versions/3.6/lib/blank3.6/codecs.py"", line 321, in decode.
