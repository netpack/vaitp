add an incrementing number to end of string in blank i am trying to add an incrementing number to the end of a string and apply this to every row in one column of my dataframe. the column has 76 rows. ideally i want the output to look like this:..event reference number.february_2019_1.february_2019_2.february_2019_3...i am trying to use apply with a lambda function but am stuck trying to figure out the next step...df_trade_file['event reference number'].apply(lambda x: enumerate(df_trade_file['event reference number']))
