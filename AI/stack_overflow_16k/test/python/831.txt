"how to make blank warn about bad practice and likely mistakes? perl has the strict and warnings pragmas and a couple of cpan modules for encouraging good style and reducing errors. is there a blank counterpart that can help me avoid such problems and bad practices while it encourages me to use a more blankic structure?..i should make it clear that i do not know what i want to avoid. there is probably a lot of traps to fall into, and i'm not looking for a substitute to reading good code, reading about common errors and writing a lot, but for a complementing automated resource."
