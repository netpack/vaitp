"why use **kwds instead of a specific named argument in a function definition? the function definition below comes from the itertools recipes page (https://docs.blank.org/2/library/itertools.html#recipes):..def random_product(*args, **kwds):.    ""random selection from itertools.product(*args, **kwds)"".    pools = map(tuple, args) * kwds.get('repeat', 1).    return tuple(random.choice(pool) for pool in pools)...the function signature would seem to be more readable written with the ""repeat"" argument specified explicitly, e.g...def random_product(*args, repeat=1)...but i'm guessing there is a reason why it is written using the general idiom. can anyone explain?"
