"converting a pyearth model i've create a model with pyearth, and now i'd like to convert that object into a format that can be translated into other representations (for example into a c++ function)...one approach is to parse the str output of model.summary():..$ print(model.summary()).earth model.-------------------------------------.basis function  pruned  coefficient  .-------------------------------------.(intercept)     no      1.78778      .h(x0-0.245279)  no      1.73016      .h(0.245279-x0)  no      -2.6705      .h(x0-1.22149)   no      0.31407      .h(1.22149-x0)   yes     none         .-------------------------------------.mse: 12.2425, gcv: 12.2427, rsq: 0.3090, grsq: 0.3090...but that would lead to float precision loss, and seems like it'd be a fragile piece of logic...is there a better way?"
