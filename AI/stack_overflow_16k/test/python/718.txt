"incorrect count in output i made a simple guessing game for practice. the program is functioning without an error but the output given is a wrong value...here is the code:..import random..welcome_phrase = ""hi there. what's your name?"".print(""{:s}"".format(welcome_phrase))..user_name = input(""name: "").print(""hey {:s}, i am crash. let's play a game. i am thinking of a number between 1 and 20. can you guess the number?"".format(user_name))..attempts = 5.secret_num = random.randint(1,20)..for attempt in range (attempts):.    guess = int(input(""guess the number: "")).    if guess &gt; secret_num:.        print(""your guess is higher than the number. try again"").    elif guess &lt; secret_num:.        print(""your guess is lower than the number. try again."").    else:.        print(""well done! {:d} is the right number."".format(guess)).        print(""it took you {:d} attempts."".format(attempt)).        break..if guess != secret_num:.    print(""sorry, you have used up all your chances."").    print(""the number was {:d}"".format(secret_num))...and here is the output:....as you can see in the image above, even though it is clear that 3 attempts were made to guess the right number, blank only counted 2 attempts. will anyone please let me know how to solve this?"
