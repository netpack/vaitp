"""ctrl + c"" is not recognising while bootup in rhel 6 seems ctrl + c is not recognising .while i run in terminal ctrl + c is recognised and its going to signal handler function as expected ..but when script is run as boot script it should recognise ctrl + c and enter .the signal handler ,but its not happening .here is part of script ....def signal_handler(signal, frame):.    print 'going to linux terminal....'.    sys.exit(0).print 'press ctrl+c to abort script and enter linux terminal....'.signal.signal(signal.sigint, signal_handler).time.sleep(5)...script is working proper ,but the problem is its not getting the terminal..ssh to the termianl is possible ,..thanks in advance"
