"arguments of function in and out of a class are different i apologize, i still don't entirely understand classes in blank. anyway, i have a program like this:..class foo(args):.    def __init__(self):.         #stuff.         self.func(self, var).    def func(self, var):.         return things(self, var).def things(self, var):.    ##some stuff...my problem is that when i run this it says i am giving 3 arguments when it asks for 2. when i change things by getting rid of the self.func and putting func(self, var) instead, it says i am giving one variable too few. what is going on? thanks in advance...edit: thanks for the answer cppcoder, but that doesn't help, because it just spits back saying there are too few args. i used a static variable instead of a function."
