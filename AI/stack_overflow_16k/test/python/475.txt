"blank: are there ways to detect missing () in method call? i want to call a method f(), but accidentally i just say f. blank3 mistakes this for a meaningless evaluation of a nonexisting variable, and therefore skips over my intended method call without any notice. is there a way to override this default behavior and to get an error message? either by forbidding dual use of an identifier as a method and as a variable, or by forbidding a meaningless statement consisting just of an identifier?"
