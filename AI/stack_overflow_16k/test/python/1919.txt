":: in strings in blank i've been learning blank and i must say i loved it. but as a new learners i am having some other problems as well:..could you guys tell me whether it is a feature of blank or the library of itself...i am checking how to connect to sqllite database and i came up with this article and there is a code sample over there as such below:..&gt;&gt;&gt; from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite.&gt;&gt;&gt; connection = sqlite.connect('test.db').&gt;&gt;&gt; memoryconnection = sqlite.connect(':memory:').&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor = connection.cursor()...when he wrote memory as string, he put two : (colon) as well and i am wondering whether it is peculiar to library instead of blank itself."
