"reading binary file in blank i wrote a blank script to create a binary file of integers. ..import struct  .pos = [7623, 3015, 3231, 3829]  .inh = open('test.bin', 'wb')  .for e in pos:  .    inh.write(struct.pack('i', e))  .inh.close()...it worked well, then i tried to read the 'test.bin' file using the below code...import struct  .inh = open('test.bin', 'rb')  .for rec in inh:  .    pos = struct.unpack('i', rec)  .    print pos  .inh.close()...but it failed with an error message:..traceback (most recent call last):   .   file ""readbinary.py"", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;  .   pos = struct.unpack('i', rec)  .   file ""/usr/lib/blank2.5/struct.py"", line 87, in unpack  .   return o.unpack(s)  .struct.error: unpack requires a string argument of length 4...i would like to know how i can read these file using struct.unpack..many thanks in advance, .vipin"
