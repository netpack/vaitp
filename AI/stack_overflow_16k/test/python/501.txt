"blank print between two patterns, including lines containing patterns i need to open a log file, and print out specific lines that are in between two different patterns...beginning = pattern1.ending = pattern2...this is what i have so far:..       def seeifdatetimeisfound():.           mylist = [].           for line in input_data:.               if ctfbegina in line:  # or whatever test is needed.                   if re.search(stringa, line) and re.search(stringb, line):.                       mylist.append((line.strip())).                       break.           for line in input_data:  # this keeps reading the file.                   if ctfendina in line.strip():.                       nextline = (next(input_data, '').strip()).                       if ctfendin not in nextline:.                           break.                       else:.                           if re.search(stringa, line) and re.search(stringb, line):.                               mylist.append((line.strip())).                           if re.search(stringa, line) and re.search(stringb, line):.                               mylist.append((line.strip())).           return mylist...what i'm trying to do is basically the equivalent of this awk code:..awk '/beginning/,/ending/' logfile...one of the problems i have with the blank code above is, it only grabs the first line it finds that contains ending pattern.  if there are multiple lines containing ending, i want the blank code to grab every one of them and only stop grabbing them when it has grabbed the last one."
