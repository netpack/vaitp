"exchange data between interactive_mode and script_mode? suppose to run a block of code in script_mode and produce such data:..my_data = [1, 2, 3, 4] #please note this is output after running not data in script...now i switch to work in console for  debugging the code..i need to use the data produced just now, while cannot copy directly for avoiding the effect of gibberish. .my solution is to pickle first in the script_mode and unpickle it in interactive_mode:..codes with 5 commands:..script mode..import pickle..with open('my_data','wb') as file:.        pickle.dump(my_data, file)...interactive_mode:..import os, pickle.# change to the working directory.os.chdir('~..').with open('my_data', 'rb') as file:.         my_data = pickle.load(file).# my_data is finally loaded in console.# then manipulate it on the console....how to do it in less steps?"
