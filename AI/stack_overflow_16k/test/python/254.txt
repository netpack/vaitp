"create a private class in a test method i am trying to do this in a test method:..def test_init(self):.    class args:.        def __init__(self):.            self.server = ""myserver"".            self.project = ""myproject""..    print(args.server).    print(args.project).    commandfile(args)...on first appearance, it looks like it should work just fine, passing an args object to my class constructor.  but for some reason its not.  pretty sure its a syntax issue, but i never tried this with blank before so im not sure.  any ideas?"
