"reading files as both vertical lists and horizental lists(blank 3.2) i have a text file that i want my program (in blank 3.2) to read as (1) every line as a list and then (2) i want to make new list that contain elements with same index in (1). like this:  ..shagy 2 3 4 5 6  .dely 3 4 5 6 7 ..horizental lists = [shagy,2,3,4,5,6] and [dely,3,4,5,6,7]  .vertical lists = [shagy,dely] and [2,3] and [3,4] and [4,5] and [5,6] and [6,7] ...i need to do this because i'm supposed to find the max value of each column (elements with the same index). so i thought if i put them in a list it would be easier to find their maximum,but i don't know how to write that."
