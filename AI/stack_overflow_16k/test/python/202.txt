"how do i manipulate a multi dimension array in a blank not using a library? i have this method:..def encode(message, rails):.    result = """".    datarails = [].    activerail = 0.    # allocate multi-dimensional array...seems inefficient.    for r in range(rails):.        datarails.append([])..    # copy characters from message into one of the arrays, or ..    for m in message:.        count = 0.        # for each rail either give it the character or a ..        while count &lt;= rails:.            print(""count: "", str(count), "" active rail:"", str(activerail)).            if activerail == count:.                datarails[activerail][count] = m.            else:.                datarails[activerail][count] = ""."".            count += 1..        activerail += 1.        if activerail &gt;= rails:.            activerail = 0..    for r in datarails:.        print(r).    # ill calculate result once i get the above right    .    return result...message is a string of text.  rails is a number.  the encode method would be called like this:..encode('xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo', 2)...in this case, i want to allocate my datarails as 2 elements, each the same length as input message.  i would replace elements in the arrays with either a letter from message or a "".""...but, it seems rather inefficient to use a loop to allocate datarails...when i run this, i get the following error:..datarails[activerail][count] = m.indexerror: list assignment index out of range...the print statement looks like valid index values:..count:  0  active rail: 0...it feels like there are two problems with my multi-dimensional array.  1) allocation and 2) access...if there is a duplicate question, please post a link. i searched through stackoverflow.  answers that seemed relevant relied on a library, which i did not want to use. i have just started learning blank and want to learn the basics of blank, not using libraries...are arrays really that difficult in blank or did i make it more difficult than it needs to me?..thanks.matt..edit:.ultimately, if the message input was this ""we are dis"", the return of this method would be ""weerdsai"". i am working through a tutorial on exercism.io.  i haven't completed the method yet. i am stuck on the array i defined."
