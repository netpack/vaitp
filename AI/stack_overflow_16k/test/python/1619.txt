"changing a library's name in blank i have a rather large personal blank library that i use for projects. i want to release it to the public, but first i wanted to change the name to something a little less silly then the personal anecdote that i named it after. ..lets say i have a library name ""foobarlib"" and it is contained within the folder ""foobarlib"" and internally it makes references to ""import foobarlib.modulename"" and what have you. ..i want to change it to ""newlibname"" and have every instance in every file of ""foobarlib"" replaced with ""newlibname"". ..what is the best way to go about this?"
