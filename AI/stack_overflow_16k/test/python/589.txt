"i have written a program that computes the collatz conjecture, it works but can't compute very large numbers, how do i get around this? the collatz conjecture is a famous unsolvable problem where a positive integer is inputted, if the number is even, the number is halved and if the number is odd, the number is multiplied by 3 and one is added. this cycle repeats until you get a recurring pattern, which is always 4,2,1...i don't know any other way to complete this task so i haven't tried anything else...if n % 2 == 0:.       n = int(n/2).       steps = steps + 1.       print(n).else:.       n = int(3*n+1).       steps = steps + 1.       print(n)...my program does this perfectly well but i want to be compute extremely large numbers (pages long), when i try to, i get an error:..overflowerror: integer division result too large for a float"
