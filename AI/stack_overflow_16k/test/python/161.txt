"listing blank tuples, the edge case i have a list of points positions, as tuples, and i'm trying to collect the points before and after point n...points = [.    (0, 0),.    (1, 1),.    (2, 2),.    (3, 3),.    (4, 4),.    (5, 5),.    (6, 6),.]...eg. if i have point three (3, 3) as an input the expected output is [(2,2), (4,4)]...testing this out, it works fine:..index = 3.a, n, b = points[ index-1 : index+2 ].print(a, b).# returns: (2, 2) (4, 4)...as long as the index is not less than 2 or greater than 5 it works as expected...here follows a few examples of where the list of tuples acts as expected:..# tuple at index zero.print(points[0]).# returns: (0, 0)...# tuples from index zero to (but not including) index three.print(points[0:3]).# returns: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]...# tuple at index negative one, (6,6) in this case.print(points[-1]).# returns: (6, 6)...however, when i combine the negative and positive indices it falls apart, why?..# tuples from index negative one, up to but not including index two.print(points[-1:2]).# returns: []...the expected output is [(6, 6), (0, 0), (1, 1)] while blank gives []...solution..thanks to dev khadka...points = [.    (0,0),.    (1,1),.    (2,2),.    (3,3),.    (4,4),.    (5,5),.    (6,6),.]..index = 0.a, _, b = np.roll(points, -(index-1), axis=0)[:3].sel_points = zip(a,b).print(list(zip(*sel_points)))...result: [(6, 6), (1, 1)]"
