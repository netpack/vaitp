"how to understand the following 'os.path.join' blank command? i have a snippet like the following...out_dir = os.path.join( dir, ""myfile-{0}"".format(os.environ['job_id']) )...i understand os.path.join is used to join one or more path components intelligently. so does that mean ""myfile-{0}"".format(os.environ['job_id']) is also a path component? why would that be? many thanks for your time and attention."
