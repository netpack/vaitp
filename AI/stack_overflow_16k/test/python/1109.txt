"assign value multiple times array, blank i have a list of elements in blank and need to assign a number to the entire list. in r, i could simply do the assignment and r would rep that number the necessary number of times. in blank, is the easiest thing to do a list comprehension?..x = [1,2,3,4,5].#want to assign 0 to every element, would like to do x[:] = 0 but this causes an error.x[:] = [0 for i in range(len(x))] #pretty long for such a simple operation"
