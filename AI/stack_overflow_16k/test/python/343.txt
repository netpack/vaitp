"drawing a checkerboard out of 1s and 0s with a nested for loop i'm using just normal blank to make a checkerboard grids out of alternating 1s and 0s. i know that i can use a nested for loop with the modulus operator but i don't know exactly what to do with the modulus inside the for loop...def print_board(board):.    for i in range(len(board)):..        print "" "".join([str(x) for x in board[i]])....    my_grid = []..    for i in range(8):.        my_grid.append([0] * 8).        for j in range(8):.            #this is where i'm stuck....print_board(my_grid)"
