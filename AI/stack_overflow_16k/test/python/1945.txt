"why do blankistas call the current reference ""self"" and not ""this""? blank is the language i know the most, and strangely i still don't know why i'm typing ""self"" and not ""this"" like in java or php...i know that blank is older than java, but i can't figure out where does this come from. especially since you can use any name instead of ""self"": the program will work fine...so where does this convention come from?"
