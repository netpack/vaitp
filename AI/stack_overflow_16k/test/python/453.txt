"menu in blank / automatic variables? i'm working on a program but i'm stuck. i have created a menu with multiple options. now i'm wondering is it possible to automatically create variables if you add a team. i.e.: normally you would enter the variable at the top and do it like teama = input. is it possible to do this automatically without any given variables and use of a database?..loop=true.while loop:.    print("""""".    lan-party 2017:.    ---------------..    1. add a team..    2. look at the teams..    3. look at the scores for the teams..    4. add scores for the team..    5. quit..     """""").loop=input(""what do you want to do?"").if loop==""1"":.#what goes here?...i've tried looking around on google and on this site but couldn't find anything. also sorry for the vague description, this is the best i could do. .thanks in advance :)"
