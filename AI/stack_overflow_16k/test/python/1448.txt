"replacing elements and removing all elements i am currently trying to figure out how to fill a list with one given element, overriding the rest of the elements in a list. so completely replacing every element in a given list with only 1 element..how can i fill a list with zeroes, overwriting all elements in the list?..for the list values = [1,2,3,4,5] is there a way to make it so the list is values = [0,0,0,0,0] ..and is there a way to remove all elements from a list? .so for values = [1,2,3,4,5] make it values[] ?"
