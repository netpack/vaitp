"blank string.format with inline pipes i'm formatting a lot of strings for user messages. one might look like this:..def sms(**kwargs):.  return ""sorry {name}, but your payment was rejects. please visit {url} and try again."".format(.    name=kwargs.get('name'),.    url=shorten_url(kwargs.get('url')).  )...if i dont need to reformat any of the keyword args, i could just do this this is sweet:..def sms(**kwargs):.  return ""sorry {name}, but your payment was rejects. please visit {url} and try again."".format(**kwargs)...so i was hoping maybe it would be possible to do something like this:..def sms(**kwargs):.  return ""sorry {name}, but your payment was rejects. please visit {url|shorten_url} and try again."".format(**kwargs)...so i could format the string inline using pipes. it may not seem like a big deal, but i'm writing a lot of these messages...i noticed blank string.vformat function but i'm not sure if thats what i'm looking for. any ideas?"
