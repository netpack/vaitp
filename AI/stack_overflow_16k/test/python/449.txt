"linear systems of inequations with blank i'm trying to solve a linear systems of inequations in blank..my linear system look something like this :...3 * x1 + 2 * x2 + 4 * x3 > 0.x1 - 4 * x2 - 7 * x3 > 0...i've tried to use numpy but linalg.solve(a, b) is designed for equations (=) and i have inequations (>)..i've thought about adding variables to my problem to trasnform inequations into equation like :...3 * x1 + 2 * x2 + 4 * x3 - x4 + 0 * x5 = 0.x1 + 4 * x2 + 7 * x3 + 0 * x4 - x5 = 0...x4 and x5 being > 0...but i don't know how many constraints i'm going to have and i don't know if linalg.solve gives only strictly positive value to variables.....i've also look into scipy linprog. ..i could add an objective function like x1 + x2 + x3, that would'nt be a problem. .but with linprog i have only inequations as &lt;= 0, but i want to exclude the value 0. it would be okay if i could have &lt; 0...i hope my problem is clear..i've asked google for some help, but find nothing. i guess i'm missing something since i can't be the only one with this problem..thank you for your help."
