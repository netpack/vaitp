"fastest way to check if a string can be created with a list of characters in blank i need to check if a string can be created with a list of characters and return true or false...i am using different solutions with list.count or collections.counter...i am also using this solution which i dont need to read through the list of characters:..def check(message, characters):.    try:.        [list(characters).remove(m) for m in message].        return true.    except:.        return false...is there a fastest way? for a very very very big list of characters. counter and list count seems slower. dont know if there is a fast blankic way to do this...example:..message = ""hello"".characters = ""hheellooasdadsfgfdgfdhgfdlkgkfd""..check(message, characters) # this should return true or false.# characters can be a veeeeery long string...duplicates matter so for example characters = ""hheloo"" would not work for message = ""hello"""
