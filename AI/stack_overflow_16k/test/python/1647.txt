"how can classes work in the same file but if they are separated then imported properly there are errors? i am new to programming, i have made a little program just to learn how to use blank and i made this. ..it works just fine if i have it in one file, but when i separate it into three files calles atlas.py , robot.py and test.py...i get an error: ""undefined variable: atlas"" in the robot class on the init line...i have commented which file it is inside in a comment right above...#atlas.py.class atlas:..def __init__(self):.    self.robots = [].    self.currently_occupied = {}..def add_robot(self, robot):.    self.robots.append(robot).    self.currently_occupied = {robot:[]}...#robot.py.class robot():..def __init__(self, rbt, atlas = atlas): #this is the main error:""undefined variable: atlas"" this happens after i separate the file.    self.xpos = 0.    self.ypos = 0.    self.atlas = atlas().    self.atlas.add_robot(rbt).    self.name = rbt..def walk(self, axis, steps=2):.    ......#test.py.robot1 = robot(""robot1"")...i put these classes into the corresponding files and test.py looks like this now:..#test.py.import robot.robot1 = robot(""robot1"")"
