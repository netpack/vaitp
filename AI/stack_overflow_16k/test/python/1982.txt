"how to avoid if/elif/else when one value corresponds with another? what's a concise way to express a direct correlation between (apple, banana) and (red, yellow).  although it gets the result i need, i'm just not happy with this.....if value == apple:.   result = red.elif value == banana:.   result = yellow.else:.   result = none...tough to search for, or even work out what to title this question, but i'm sure it's a basic exercise. isn't it?"
