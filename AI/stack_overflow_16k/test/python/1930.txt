"blank says that a float number is an integer i was writing a program to check and print if a number is integer or float and it usually works great..but when i try some value like 2.0000000000000001 i get the message it is an integer, why?..code:..import math..number = float(input(""enter a number: ""))..if number == round(number):.    print(""integer number"").else:.    print(""float number"")"
