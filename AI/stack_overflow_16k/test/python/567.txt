"building blank interpreter on windows with ucs4 support how can i configure the blank interpreter build project to build with ucs4 support on windows?  for example, i want to create blank 2.6.9, 64 bits + ucs4 support for windows...we want to produce pre-compiled blank files (.pyc files) for multiple platforms.  due to our existing build setup we wish to build all the .pyc files on windows, with those files in turn being distributed for use on other, unix-like platforms...so, we need to have various versions of the blank interpreter on windows - versions that do not exist as an installer package...i have built blank 2.6.9 32 bits with ucs2 support using visual studio and the unmodified blank source tree and visual studio project files.  i see in pyconfig.h there is #define py_unicode_size 2.  however, changing this 2 to a 4 has no effect on the resulting blank interpreter."
