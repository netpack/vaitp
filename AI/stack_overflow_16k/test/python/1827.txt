"blank text file data extraction i have a text file that looks likes this..p1 : some data.p2 : blabla.p4 : whatever.f1 : something.f2 : something else.g6 : this entry continues.g6 : down here...this is followed by a empty line and then a new record which looks the same as above (about 100k total). i need to get a text file in which every line contains the p2, p4 and g6 entry separated by a tab...this is what i have so far..output = open('out.txt', 'w').output.write(""p1tg6n"")..p1_ = false.g6_ = false..with open(""data.txt"", 'r') as data:.    for line in data:.        if line.startswith('p1 :'):.            p1 = line[4:10].            p1_ = true..        elif line.startswith('g6'):         .            g6 = line.lstrip('g6 :').            g6_ = true..        else:.            continue..        if p1_ and g6_ :.            output.write(year + ""t"" + abstract).            year_ = false.            abstract_ = false.output.close().data.close()...the problem i encounter is that some records do not have all entries i need and some have the g6 spread over several lines. any ideas on how to do this?..edit: after reading all of your answers i realised my question was a bit vague. i do need the records which do not have all entries."
