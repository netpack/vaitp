"converting nc4 to .cvs and iterate over files with os.walk i am a blank beginner and i was writing a litle simple code to extract .nc4 data to .cvs..the code works, but i would like to iterate it over a file directory. i tried with os.walk but i couldn't get it to work...here is my code:..from netcdf4 import dataset.nc=dataset('g:\oco2_ltco2_190801_b9003r_190918235239s.nc4','r').for i in nc.variables:.         print i.         latitude=nc.variables[""latitude""][:].         longitude=nc.variables[""longitude""][:].         xco2=nc.variables[""xco2""][:]..with open('g:\co2.csv', 'w') as csv_writer:.         csv_writer.write('""lat"",""lon"",""co2""n').         for i in range(len(latitude)):.                 csv_writer.write('""{}"",""{}"",""{}""n'.format(latitude[i],longitude[i],xco2[i])).csv_writer.close()"
