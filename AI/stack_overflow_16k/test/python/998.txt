"combine lists of strings element-wise with special rules i am new to blank and i'm trying to modify an existing program. i have several lists and i need to perform an operation on them in a sorted way. for example if i have the following lists:..list_a = ['a1', 'a2', 'a3'].list_b = ['b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5']...i want to get a new list with elements = ['a1b1', 'a2b2', 'a3b3', 'b4b5'] (i.e combine alternating elements till the smaller array runs out then combine remaining elements from the large array...this is an example for 2 lists but i'm trying to do this for n lists...is there a 'blankic' way of achieving this?..edit: adding more info for the n>3 case (and made the lists bigger to show them more clearly)...list_a = ['a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'a4', 'a5', 'a6'].list_b = ['b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6'].list_c = ['c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4']...start with the 'smallest' list and start pairing. for now i am handling a case where there is one shorter list and the others are the same lengths. so either a or b below would work...expected output: ['c1b1', 'c2b2', 'c3b3', 'c4b4', 'b5b6', 'a1a2', 'a3a4', 'a5a6']"
