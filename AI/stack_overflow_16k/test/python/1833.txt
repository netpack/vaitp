"don't understand this blank for loop i'm still a blank newb, but i'm working through the pyneurgen neural network tutorial, and i don't fully understand how the for loop used to create the input data works in this instance:..for position, target in population_gen(population):.    pos = float(position).    all_inputs.append([random.random(), pos * factor]).    all_targets.append([target])`...what is the loop iterating through exactly? i've not come across the use of the comma and a function in the loop before...thanks in advance for any help :)"
