"syntax error in blank 3.2.1: unable to write an exception to a valueerror i'm new at blank and recently i've been trying to write a code for a hangman game: a part of the mit ocw course: introduction to computer science and programming. my code goes as follows:..def write_words (word, al):.    neww = (list(word)).    newal = (list(al)).    x = 0.    while (x &lt;= (len(newal))):.        z = newal[x].        y = neww.index(z).        except valueerror:.            pass.        x = x + 1.        return (z).        return (y)...when i call the function using write_words (""word"", ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy"") i still get the valueerror:'a' is not in list, that is supposed to be corrected with the exception. i 've been trying to figure out the problem, and apparently is a syntax error. please, i would be very grateful with any help. my blank version is the 3.2.1"
