"how to iterate a tuple of lists? alright this might be a stupid one but i am kinda stuck right now..i am dealing with arguments of type tuple, containing lists of lists and just can't read them properly...here is a basic example:..def test(*args):.    for arg in args:.        print(arg).        print(arg[0]).        print(arg[1])..testtuple1 = ([[""x_1"", ""x_2"", ""x_3""], []]).testtuple2 = ([['x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3'], []], [['x_2', 'x_3'], ['x_1']])..test(testtuple1).test(testtuple2)...which results in the following outputs:..[['x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3'], []].['x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3'].[]..([['x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3'], []], [['x_2', 'x_3'], ['x_1']]).[['x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3'], []].[['x_2', 'x_3'], ['x_1']]...the output of the first example is the output i would have expected. however i don't get the first output of the second example. why am i getting a tuple and not the first of the lists contained in the tuple: [['x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3'], []]?"
