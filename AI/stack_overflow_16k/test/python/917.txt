"how do you get number frequencies in a list, then index into another list? blank 2.7.5 (don't judge me) ..what i have (e.g.):..numbers = [1,3,5,1,3,5,7,0,2,2,9,1]..frequencies = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]...i need a for loop that counts by going through the elements of numbers and modifying frequencies accordingly by indexing. frequencies should look like: ..[1,3,2,2,0,2,0,1,0,1]...i tried using the len() function...for some reason...i just haven't found a way to incorporate count properly."
