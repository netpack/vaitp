"how to simulate roll of a dice how to simulate the roll of an unfair 6-sided die. instead of each side having an even chance of coming up (1/6 = 16.7%), the middle numbers should be favored. there should be a 20% chance of rolling a 2, 3, 4, or 5, and only a 10% chance of rolling a 1 or a 6. .thanks"
