"list of lists to dictionary conversion i have a list of lists:..l = [['bob'],['5', '0', '0', '0', '0'],['jack'],['3', '0', '0', '1', '-3'],['larry'],['1', '-3', '1', '-5', '0'], ...]...i want to convert this list of lists into a dictionary with the names as keys and the numbers as values so that it returns:..{'bob':[5, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'jack':[3, 0, 0, 1, -3], 'larry':[1, -3, 1, -5, 0], ...}...so i want a dictionary with strings as keys and an array of integers as values for each string, however, i can't figure out how to go about doing this...the major thing here that troubles me is how to make it so the dictionary takes every other entry of the list as the values, while at the same time convert the strings into integers."
