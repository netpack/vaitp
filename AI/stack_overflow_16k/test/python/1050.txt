"can you create traditional fixed length and type arrays in blank? i am teaching the a level syllabus by the cambridge exam board. one typical question on the practical paper is this:...  in a programming language of your choice, declare an array of ten integers and then initializes it....i have this:..myarray = []        #create the array..for i in range(10): # initializes to 0.    myarray.append(0)...i believe this is what most people would do in blank? however, unlike pascal etc it does not strictly answer the question as the lists in blank are essentially dynamic arrays with the added problem of not restricting the data type of each element. can i declare a specific size array and type  like in pascal, instead of an empty dynamic list, without any type of loop and restricts the type of the array?..something like (pseudo code):..myarray[10] : integer...this is a none commercial question but an educational one."
