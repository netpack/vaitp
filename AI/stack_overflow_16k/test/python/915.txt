"printing same line in blank3 with a function callback i'm trying to create a function that returns a 'pulse' every time it does something. the function must be passed as a callback if the person desires to receive the pulse. i'd like to print the pulses as new . character in the same line, so i did this:..import time..def do_something(do=none):.    while true:.        time.sleep(1).        if do: do('.')..def prtn(text):.    print(text, end=' ')..do_something(prtn)...but the code gets stuck and won't print anything!"
