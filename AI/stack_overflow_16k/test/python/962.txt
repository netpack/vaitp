"obtain input and append into separate list i have a set of integers that will be an input for my set of code and after the input, i want to append them into separate list. my input has ':' that acts as a separator...example of user input:..10.3:42.1:54.7:65.2...example of output:..list1 = [10.3,42.1].list2 = [54.7,65.2]...my code:..userinput = input(""enter input digits).#it's not possible for float only as it also has ':'?.list1 = [].list2 = []..for i in userinput:.    list1.append().    list2.append().    ..    ....i'm not familiar with inputs with both floats and punctuations in them. i'll appreciate if anyone could explain on how i could implement them correctly as an input."
