"using a variable as an index for a list can't find a way around this anywhere else..using blank 3.7 ..rownum = input.row = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].print(row[rownum])...this is an overly simplified example of my program..basically all i want to do is make it so that i can use whatever value is entered into ""rownum"" as the index. i'm getting ""keyerror : number inputted"".not sure how to fix..(i am relativley new to this site so excuse me for bad formatting if any)"
