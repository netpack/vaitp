"blank : case of opening a file code : ..f = open('workfile', 'r')   line #1.if f != none :              line #2.     print f.read()         line #3...workfile is not there in the directory, so understandably blank create one.(although in blank documentation they did not mention it ). ok..but when i change the file name from 'workfile to 'names 'with same code .. f = open('names', 'r')   line #1...it shows ioerror : no such file or directory...why didn't it created another file of 'names' ? as it did in case of 'workfile'"
