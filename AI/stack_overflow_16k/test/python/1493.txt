"parameter based branching let's suppose i have to branch depending on the parameter passed to the function:..def args_func(foo=none, bar=none):.    if foo:.        print foo.    else:.        print baz..args_func(foo='foobarbaz')...is this the only way to branch on this context? this is because the else clause is ambiguous whereas the if clause is very specific with it's conditional (""if foo is true"") and since i only have two possible parameters following the zen of blank, explicit is better than implicit.    ..maybe if/else is not the right construct for this task?"
