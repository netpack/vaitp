"how to check whether an element is in a list of lists? i want to check if zero is in this list of lists. for example:..lst = [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]..if lists in 'lst' contains ""0"", then print(""yes""), else print(""no""). the above list should give the result of ""yes"", since lst[1][2] == 0...here is my code, but it doesn't work:..if (0 in (lst[x] for x in range(len(lst)))):.    print(""yes"").else:.    print(""no"")"
