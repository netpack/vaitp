"what's going wrong with my blank logic? i'm attempting to create a directory editor for a warehouse managing project, but every time i try to create a new folder that has already been created, rather than handling the problem like i specify in the elif block it gives me this error :..fileexistserror: [winerror 183] cannot create a file when that file already exists: 'c:/users/user_name/documents/warehouse_storage/folder_name'...as far as i can tell, there's nothing wrong with the base logic of my if statement...here's my code:..if operation.lower() == ""addf"" :..    name = input(""what would you like to name your new folder? n"")..    for c in directory_items :.        if name != c :.            os.makedirs(path + name + ""/"").            operation_chooserd()..        elif name == c:.            print(""you already created a folder with this name."").            operation_chooserd()"
