"is it possible to create a nested function with state in blank? i'm trying to make a callback that updates if it's been more than a second since the last report.  it looks something like this..def main_func().    ....    start_time = time.time().    def callback():.        current_time = time.time().        if current_time - start_time &gt; 1.0:.            print 'working'.            start_time = time.time().    work_function(args, callback)...since start_time is local the global keyword won't work inside callback.  is there a blank paradigm that can handle adding state to local functions?"
