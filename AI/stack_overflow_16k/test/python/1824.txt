"how can i check if recv is empty from my client socket i have a client sending messages every second. ..i'm trying to implement a keepalive method: if no message have been sent in the last 5 seconds then the client should send a keepalive message to let the server know we still want it to stay alive. ..the way i want to handle it is: if keepalive is set to true in my ini fil then make client send an empty message. then i want the server to check if the recv from the client is empty, if it is empty then it should a message back to the client to send a keepalive message. ..i tried to check data like this: ..data = s.recv(1024).if data == """";. #do something...i tried with coding my client to send an empty message to test it, but it does not work...     msg = """".            s.send(msg.encode())...is it wrong to use """" as an empty message in blank when it comes to sockets?.if i set my client to send a empty message such as ="""" it wont return true in my if data =="""";"
