"apply operation to multiple variables i feel like this solution is overkill and i might not be using the builtins correctly...can someone suggest a better way to apply the same operation to a list of variables?..edit -- or change them without re-assigning the values (if that's possible)..size = 150.free = 27.used = 123..size, free, used = list(map(lambda x: x * 1024, [size, free, used]))"
