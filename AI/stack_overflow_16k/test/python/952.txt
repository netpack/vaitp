"how to collect the value corresponding to a field of an array/list of named tuples i am new to blank, in the process of migrating from matlab. i was using the namedtuple class the following way...from collections import namedtuple.import numpy as np.mystruct = namedtuple(""mystruct"", ""field1 field2 field3"").d = [].d.append(mystruct(field1=np.array(3,'int'),field2=np.array(4,'int'),field3=np.array(5,'int'))).d.d.append(mystruct(field1=np.array(4,'int'),field2=np.array(5,'int'),field3=np.array(6,'int')))...here d is a 2-element list of namedtuple objects. what i want is to obtain an array of all field1 values through all the elements of d in a nifty way without the need to iterate through the elements of d. something similar to matlab, where we put square brackets around an array of structures. ..i'd appreciate any insights into this matter...srini"
