"pymatch giving error when fitting: unable to coerce to series, length must be 1: given xxx i am trying to build a score matching using pymatch. unfortunately i am getting the following error ..fitting models on balanced samples: 1200error: unable to coerce to series, length must be 1: given 1898...here is my code..from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_blobs.from pymatch.matcher import matcher.import pandas as pd.import numpy as np..x, y = make_blobs(n_samples=5000, centers=2, n_features=2, cluster_std=3.5).df = pd.dataframe(dict(x=x[:,0], y=x[:,1], label=y)).df['population'] = np.random.choice([1, 0], size=len(df), p=[0.8, 0.2])..control = df[df.label == 1].test = df[df.label == 0]..m = matcher(test, control, yvar=""population"", exclude=['label'])..m.fit_scores(balance=true, nmodels=200)...if i ran this code i will get the error. i am quite sure that i was able to run this before, but after changing some versions, this doesn't work anymore. unfortunately i wasn't able to fix it by going back to previous versions, so not sure what's going on here..."
