"ending blankw.exe process on manual exit i can't seem to find the right google search to figure out something that should be easy...i am using wxblank to create a gui, and saving the blank files as .pyw so i don't have a console. then i am importing another .py file into the main window when a user does an action. doing so created the blankw.exe instance that won't close. to be clear, the .pyw that opens if i only open the main console will clear from my processes if i don't open/insert the other .py file from the first file while running...when i use the program everything is perfectly fine, but when i use the windows ""x"" button to close i still get blankw.exe in my processes, and the file i am printing errors to is locked due to something else using it(the blankw.exe). what code do i need to use to make sure that blank is exiting completely? it also seems to stay whenever i build in a file - exit as well, and it is only staying on the processes if i insert the other module(only done with user input)..also this may be obvious but if i open the imported file manually it has the same behavior, as in the blank.exe closes when i close out of the file."
