"dictionary becomes nonetype at the end of for loop i'm writing a sample code for a function that will add a list of items to a dictionary. the problem is that at the end of the for loop, the backpack dictionary becomes a nonetype object. why is that, and how do i stop my dictionary from becoming blank?..def addtoinventory(inventory, addeditems):.    for i in addeditems:.        inventory.setdefault(i, 0).        inventory[i] += 1..backpack = {'gold coin': 42, 'rope': 1}.dragonloot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby'].backpack = addtoinventory(backpack, dragonloot)..print(type(inv))"
