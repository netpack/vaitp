"reading and deleting lines in blank i am trying to read all the lines in a specific file, and it prints the number of the line as an index...what i am trying to do is to delete the line by inputting the number of the line by the user..as far as it is now, it prints all the lines with the number of that line, but when i enter the number of the line to be deleted, it's not deleted...this is the code of the delete function:..def deleteorders ():..    index = 0.    fh = open ('orders.txt', 'r').    lines = fh.readlines()..    for line in lines:.        lines = fh.readlines().        index = index+1.        print (str(index) + ' ' + line)...    try:.        indexinp = int(input('enter the number of the order to be deleted, or ""b"" to go back: '))..        if indexinp == 'b':.            return.        else:.            del line[indexinp].            print (line)..            fh = open ('orders.txt', 'w').            fh.writelines(line).            fh.close()..    except:.        print ('the entered number is not in the range').        return"
