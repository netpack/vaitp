"shutil.move removing file extensions you guys have been a great help with my learning blank. i was tasked today with modifying an old employees code and have since downloaded several resources to help. i am renaming files in a folder. basically a user inputs something in a text box and that is being added on to the end of the file...if len(self.toloc.get()) == 0:.        searchrev = ""_r"" + newrev .        for filename in os.listdir(app.pdfdir):.            sep = searchesri.            rest = filename.split(sep, 1)[0] + searchrev + fromlocation.            shutil.move(os.path.join(app.pdfdir, filename), os.path.join(app.pdfdir, rest))...it works perfectly, the only issue i have is that it does not keep the file extensions and unfortunatly there are pdfs and xlsx's in the dir so i can't just hard code pdf on the end. i tried to see if the os function had a way of getting it but i kind of confused myself..."
