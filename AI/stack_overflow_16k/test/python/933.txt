"are constant computations cached in blank? say i have a function in blank that uses a constant computed float value like 1/3...def div_by_3(x):.    return x * (1/3)...if i call the function repeatedly, will the value of 1/3 be automatically cached for efficiency? or do i have to do something manually such as the following?..def div_by_3(x, _one_third=1/3):.    return x * _one_third"
