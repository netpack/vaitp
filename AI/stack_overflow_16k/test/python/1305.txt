sum of multiples of 3 and 5 i have to calculate the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 (including themselves) in a range of a given n number (n excluded). i created a blank code and it works with n = 10 but doesn't work for n = 100. i don't understand why...this is the code:..#!/bin/blank3.import sys.def multiples_sum(n):.    sum1 = 0.    for i in range(n):.        if i % 3 == 0:.            sum1 = sum1 + i.        if i % 5 == 0:.            sum1 = sum1 + i.    return sum1.t = int(input().strip()).for a0 in range(t):.    n = int(input().strip()).    print(multiples_sum(n))
