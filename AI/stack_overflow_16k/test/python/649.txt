"list index out of range error for blank constant size list i am trying to read a certain number of lines from a txt file and split store some of words per line into variables. however, i keep getting an index out of range error and i cannot understand why...here is the code:..for i in range(230218):.    count=i+1.    if count != coordinate:.            writefile.write(str(count)+""0"").    else:.            writefile.write(str(count)+coverage).            lineread=f.readline().            x=lineread.split().            coordinate=int(x[1]).            coverage=x[3]...and the error say tat coordinate and coverage are the ones which are out of range...edit: i think the problem was that the input file was too large so it wasn't generating a list for x at all. the problem resolved itself when i ran it on a different machine."
