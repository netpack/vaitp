"how do i implement rstrip for arbitrary strings? say i have a bunch of strings, which can either end in pineapple, ham, or grapefruit.  what is the best way to produce a list of ""stripped strings,"" that are exactly identical to the original strings except that if the string ended with pineapple, the pineapple would be trimmed from the end, and if the string ended with ham, the ham would be trimmed?..for example, suppose my input was ..[""i really like pineapple"",.""i don't like ham or grapefruit"",.""today i ate a lot of ham"",.""but i also ate a lot of grapefruit""]...then the output should be..[""i really like"",.""i don't like ham or grapefruit"",.""today i ate a lot of"",.""but i also ate a lot of grapefruit""]"
