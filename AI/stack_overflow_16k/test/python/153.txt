"passing list between functions i have the code below where i change the globals. most of what i have read has said to stay away from globals... in the example below i want to use ""make_lists"" then print it in ""print_list"" then clear the list. i use globals to do this, suggestions on how to avoid globals?..i know i could add this all in one function, but this is all part of a bigger function this is the only part i am having problems with. thank in advance...x_lst = []..def make_lists():.    global x_lst..    x_lst.append(""hello"")..def print_list():.    global x_lst..    for i in x_lst:.        print(i)..    x_lst = []..def main():.    make_lists().    print_list()..if __name__ ==""__main__"":.    main()"
