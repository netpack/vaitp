"how to append and prepend to every line in each text file in directory? i've come up with this code in blank which takes a text file in directory and prepends and appends input to every line. here it is:..prefix = '111'.suffix = '222'..with open('source.txt', 'r') as src:.    with open('dest.txt', 'w') as dest:.       for line in src:.           dest.write('%s%s%sn' % (prefix, line.rstrip('n'), suffix)).....so, i want to do the same type of thing, but instead, i have in the directory a bunch of txt files each containing several hundred lines...and i want it to append and prepend (like above) to each line in each file in that directory...how can i do this?"
