passing text file data to a variable i am learning blank and am having a bit of trouble with utilizing data in a text file...as an example the text file is structured line by line like this:..name 656 334...i want to grab the data in a loop line by line and put the two integers into two separate variables like a = 656 b = 334 but i’m having trouble getting it to do that. i’ve tried various iterations of lists and numpy arrays but at most i can only get it to include both numbers together when i call on the array...any help would be much appreciated.
