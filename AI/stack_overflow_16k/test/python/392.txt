"what is the most effecient way to keep track of collisions i am a new young programmer and i am learning blank. i am just making a sample program to learn how to make bigger programs...class robot():..    def __init__(self):.        self.xpos = 0.        self.ypos = 0..    def step(self, axis):.        print ""step"".        if axis in ""xx"":.            self.xpos += 1.        elif axis in ""yy"":.            self.ypos += 1..    def walk(self, axis, steps=2):.        for i in range(steps):.            self.step(axis)..    def get_pos(self):.        print ""x:%i  y:%i"" % (self.xpos, self.ypos)...robot = robot().robot.walk(""x"", steps=3)...all this does is keep track of where an individual robot is. how can i keep track if i have two robots and if they are in the same location...example:..robot1 = robot().robot2 = robot().robot1.walk(""x"",5).robot2.walk(""x"",5)...they would be in the same location so how would i check to see if any robots are in the same location?"
