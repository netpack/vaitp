"list of lists to dictionary where key is entry value and value is entry value i have a list of lists:..[[0, 1, 2,], [130, 131], [142, 143]]...i want to transform this list l to a dictionary of the following form:..{'0': 0, '1': 0, '2':'0, '130': 1, '131: 1, '142': 2, '143': 2}...so the key is the list element. the respective value is the entries name from the sublist of l. i hope you can follow my issue...i tried the following code, which didn't work at all...cluster_list = list(range(len(list(l))))..dictionary = dict(zip(cluster_list, l))...i have to add: every sublist states which nodes are members of the same cluster. so every node is only present once...i hope we can solve this issue together. thank you!"
