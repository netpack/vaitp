"blank: problem with local modules shadowing global modules i've got a package set up like so:..packagename/.    __init__.py.    numbers.py.    tools.py.    ...other stuff...now inside tools.py, i'm trying to import the standard library module fractions. however, the fractions module itself imports the numbers module, which is supposed to be the one in the standard library...the problem is that it tries to import the numbers modules from my package instead (ie my numbers.py is shadowing the stdlib numbers module), and then complains about it, instead of importing the stdlib module...my question is, is there a workaround so that i can keep the current structure of my package, or is the only solution to rename my own offending module (numbers.py)?"
