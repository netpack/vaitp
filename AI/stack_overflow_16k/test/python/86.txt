"my code is returning the wrong if statement i'm trying to write a simple code which will open a door for students above 18, but whatever number i input it always returns the wrong option in the if statement. .please see it below...def checkstudentage:. input(""what is your name student?: "")..age = 0..if int(age) &lt; 18. print(""this door only opens for students that are 18 are above"")..elif int(age)  &gt; 18. print("" you are welcome, please push the door and step in"")..else int(age) ==18. print(""congrats you can step in)..checkstudentage()...whenever i call the function, and input an int higher than 18, it still says "" this door only opens for students 18 and above"". i am new to blank and this my first language,  i'd appreciate corrections ..i did age = 0, because i want to assign a value to age incase no input is given"
