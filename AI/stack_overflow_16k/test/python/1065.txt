"can i create a list inside of an object i am an intermediate programmer just getting into blank.  i am creating a simple classroom manager program that allows you to create a class of students with property names, age and avg.  i was wondering if it was somehow possible for me to create a function i.e. getmarks() that would allow me to insert x amount of marks for that student and have that list stored inside the property avg (or the sum(list)/len(list) for actual average)..here are some code examples so you can understand what i mean better..class student():..    def __init__(self, name, grade, avg):.        self.name = name.        self.grade = grade.        self.avg = avg..    def addstudent():..        studentnum = int(input(""how many students do you want to add?: ""))..        for n in range(studentnum):..            newname = input(""student name: "").            newgrade = int(input(""student grade: "")).            newavg = random.randrange(50, 100) .            # *i would like to be able to store this as a list*.            myclass.append(student(newname, newgrade, newavg))...here are some things i tried but none of them really worked..def setmark():..    markwho = input(""who are you adding a mark(s) for?: "").    newmark = int(input(""enter mark: ""))...    for i in myclass:.        if(i.name == markwho):.            markdict[i] = []..            markdict[i].append(newmark)..def getmark():.    markwho2 = input(""whose mark's would you like to see?: "")..    studavg = 0..    for i in myclass:.        if(i.name == markwho2):.            studavg = sum(markdict[i]) / len(markdict[i]).            print(markdict[i] + "" naccording to this data this student has a {}%       average"".format(studavg))..def getavg(name):.    for i in markdict:.        if(i.name == name):.        print(markdict[i])"
