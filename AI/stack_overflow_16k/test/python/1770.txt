"using for loop variable to select tuple value (blank) i'm creating a for loop in blank to loop through values in a tuple. the code i have is:..for x in sageresult:.    soporderreturnid=sageresult[x]...this produces the error:..inserterror: list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple...replacing x with 0 works fine, but using the loop value doesn't work. how can i get around this?"
