"gtk loop or cron for timer well, i have created a blank script, which checks the number of uncompleted tasks of tasque and displays it using pynotify periodically. my question is how do i implement this timer. i can think of two things. a cron job to execute a blank script periodically or using a blank script which uses a gtk loop to call the specified function for checking periodically."
