"is there a purpose in calling super() from a basic blank class? i have somewhat of a strange question here. let's say i'm making a simple, basic class as follows:..class myclass(object):..    def __init__(self):.        super(myclass, self).__init__()...is there any purpose in calling super()? my class only has the default object parent class. the reason why i'm asking this is because my ide automagically gives me this snippet when i create a new class. i usually remove the super() function because i don't see any purpose in leaving it. but maybe i'm missing something ?"
