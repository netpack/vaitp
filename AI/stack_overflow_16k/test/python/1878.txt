"how to calculate how many line has a specific word i'm not sure if the if statement is wrong? i tried to split each line and iterate through each index and find 'the raven' and return the count.    ..def count_word(file_url, word):.    r = requests.get(file_url, stream=true).    count = 0..    for line in r.iter_lines():.        words = line.split().        if line[1:] == 'the raven':.            count += 1.    return count"
