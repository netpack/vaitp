"blank get function monthconversions={.    ""jan"":""january"", #key:value.    ""feb"":'february', #make sure keys are unique.    'mar':'march', #can also use integers.    'apr':""april"",.    'may':'may',.    'jun':'june',..}.print(monthconversions['jan']) #gives value associated with the key.print(monthconversions.get('luv','not a valid key'))...hi, i am currently learning blank through freebootcamp on youtube, and the person mentioned we can use the get function to pass in a value for a key that is not in the dictionary. i kind of understand that, but i fail to see what the use of this would be. i thought it would add luv in when i put in ..print(monthconversions['luv'])...but it instead gives a error. what would be the purpose of the get function in this situation anyway? it feels like extra work and i don't get how it would be useful. any explanations would be greatly appreciated, thank you."
