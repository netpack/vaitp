"check if input is available on stdin with timeout i have a blank script that publishes messages that are read from stdin onto a message queue in the network. however, if there wasnt any message on the pipe for a specified amount of time i have to send a heartbeat. ..so i have to distinguish between 3 cases:...) there is input on the pipe that can be processed.) there was no input for some specified amount of time.) the piping process has been closed and we can gracefully terminate....currently, my code looks as follow:..import sys.for i, line in enumerate(sys.stdin):.    connection.publish(line).connection.close()...however i need to interrupt the for look if there was any timeout. i.e. sys.stdin has not delivered any data for some time."
