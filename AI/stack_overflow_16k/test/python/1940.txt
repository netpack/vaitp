"why is sorted documented as taking an iterable instead of a collection? is there some deeper meaning why blank's sorted is documented as taking an iterable (which may be infinite) instead of a collection (which is sized)?..for example, this will run forever:..# do not run.import itertools..for item in sorted(itertools.count()):.    print(item)...i get that they'd want to allow sorted to work on a collection's iterable object instead of the collection itself, but isn't there a fundamental difference (perhaps to be reflected in collections.abc) between iterables that are guaranteed to raise a stopiteration and iterables that may be infinite?"
