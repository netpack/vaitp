"call function of class using a variable function call i'm trying to call a function from a class thats name will change depending on what type of enemy is being instantiated. how can i accomplish this?..my attempt was this: assignclass.[self.class](self)..but obviously that sintax makes no sense..class creature:..    def __init__(self, name, class):..        self.name   = name.        self.class  = class..        # using a variable function call to remove.        # the need for a ton of 'if' statements..        assignclass.[self.class](self)..        # basically automate doing this:..        if self.class = ""orc"":.            assignclass.orc(self).        elif self.class = ""wizard"".            assignclass.wizard(self)...class assignclass:..    def orc(creature):.        creature.class='orc'.        creature.health=100.        creature.mana=0..    def wizard(creature):.        creature.class='wizard'.        creature.health=75.        creature.mana=200..evil_wizard = creature(""evil wizard"", ""wizard"")"
