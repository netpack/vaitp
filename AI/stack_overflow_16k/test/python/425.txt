"how to convert value's in df by loop? i have data set with string column and i had to convert them into int value the problem is some columns have 90+ different value and to convert them .manually and take time, there is a function to solve it automatically?..i did it, but manually:..price_dict = {91:0, 65:1, 0:1, 20:1, 35:1, 32:1, 41:1, 36:1, 15:1, 90:1, 6:1, 67:1, 2:1, 57:1, 39:1, 1:1, 79:1, 34:1, 85:1} # not all..app[`price`] = app[`price`].apply(lambda a: price_dict[a]) # 0 = free, 1 = not free..app[`price`].value_counts() # to check....i have tried :.. for x in app[`price`]:..        if x == 1:.            price_dict = {91:0}.        else:.            price_dict = {x:1}..app[`price`] = app[`price`].apply(lambda a: price_dict[a])# 0 = free, 1 = not free..app[`price`].value_counts()"
