"blank http request is not working properly so i am trying to code that registers an account on a squarespace website. i fired up fiddler and intercept the http requests, saw the post request that sends the form data:....so i wrote this code in blank: ..import requests..session = requests.session()..data = {.

'email': 'flff30@mxi_w.com'.}..r = session.post('http://miniview.squarespace.com/api/site-users/account/profile', data=data,verify=false).r.text..u'{""message"":""user must be logged in to access this resource.""}...what's my mistake with this blank request?..it's strange because i'm expected to be logged before i can register...edit:..the first person that answered me said i should look into the cookies which i did, now i am trying to manually add cookies to the request session cookiejar but something is unclear to me. this request..post https://minnicow.squarespace.com/api/census/recordhit http/1.1.host: minicow.squarespace.com.user-agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64; rv:71.0) gecko/20100101 firefox/71.0.accept: application/json, text/plain, */*.accept-language: en-us,en;q=0.5.accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br.content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8.x-csrf-token: btoh7ecmmp4cyzg0yji3otq3mji5nzk1mge2zwzkztq1otqwotiw.content-length: 741.origin: https://minicow.squarespace.com.dnt: 1.connection: keep-alive.referer: https://minicow.squarespace.com/.cookie: crumb=btoh7ecmmp4cyzg0yji3otq3mji5nzk1mge2zwzkztq1otqwotiw; ss_cvr=014571ee-fb3f-498c-b2a0-a9b5c470f9af|1576941479208|1576941479208|1576941479208|1; ss_cvt=1576941479208..event=1&amp;data=%7b%22localstoragesupported%22%3atrue%2c%22querystring%22%3a%22%22%2c%22referrer%22%3a%22%22%2c%22websiteid%22%3a%225dfd4479a068b47518c09b20%22%2c%22templateid%22%3a%225c5a519771c10ba3470d8101%22%2c%22website_locale%22%3a%22en-us%22%2c%22useragent%22%3a%22mozilla%2f5.0%20(windows%20nt%2010.0%3b%20win64%3b%20x64%3b%20rv%3a71.0)%20gecko%2f20100101%20firefox%2f71.0%22%2c%22clientdate%22%3a1576941479207%2c%22viewportinnerheight%22%3a790%2c%22viewportinnerwidth%22%3a1536%2c%22screenheight%22%3a864%2c%22screenwidth%22%3a1536%2c%22url%22%3a%22%2f%22%2c%22title%22%3a%22home%22%2c%22collectionid%22%3a%225dfd45313ef7d373d3d9a389%22%7d&amp;ss_cvr=014571ee-fb3f-498c-b2a0-a9b5c470f9af%7c1576941479208%7c1576941479208%7c1576941479208%7c1...responds with this ..http/1.1 200 ok.date: sat, 21 dec 2019 15:18:08 gmt.strict-transport-security: max-age=0.set-cookie: ss_cid=40ec759f-0ef6-4c31-a7c8-d8c1f2127d8a; path=/; expires=mon, 20-dec-2021 15:18:09 gmt; max-age=63072000.expires: thu, 01 jan 1970 00:00:00 gmt.set-cookie: ss_cvisit=1576941489288; path=/; expires=sat, 21-dec-2019 15:48:09 gmt; max-age=1800.set-cookie: ss_cpvisit=1576941489288; path=/; expires=mon, 20-dec-2021 15:18:09 gmt; max-age=63072000.content-type: application/json;charset=utf-8.x-content-type-options: nosniff.transfer-encoding: chunked.x-contextid: kpebsi9l/goykgpyu.server: squarespace..11.{""success"": true}.0...i.e three new cookies are set (ss_cid, ss_cvisit and ss_cpvisit) .. when i tried to recreate this request in blank requests, i get the same success message in the response body but these 3 new cookies are not being set. ..then i noticed that the request header contains three cookies - i was able to set the first one  (crub cookie), but  could not figure out how the other two cookies (ss_cvr and ss_cvt ) are being set...i checked the whole fiddler log right from where the page is loaded to the point where this request is made, i could not find where they are set. i also search their values in the preceding responses i couldn't find them, while ss_cvt looks like epoch form of the time was made while ss_cvr hasthe  form ""uuid()|ss_cvt|ss_cvt|ss_cvt|1"" . i tried generating and substituting those values in the request but nothing works...i am trying to get this to work, but it is obvious that i need help"
