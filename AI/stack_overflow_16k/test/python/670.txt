"is there a way to escape keywords in kwargs i have the following instance function ..class myclass:..    def __init__(self):.        self.request = dict()..    def my_func(self, **kwargs):.        self.request['arguments'] = kwargs...and i wish to use it as below:..obj = myclass().obj.my_func(global = true)...as you can see, i wish to use a blank keyword as a key value on the kwargs. i know it is a syntax error. i wonder if there is a way to escape it so one can produce a kwargs with value {'global':true}...i couldn't find anything related to this in the official docs. i was expecting a way to escape them as kwargs keys are of type string."
