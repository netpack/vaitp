"run an autocorrect program on a text file on blank i am very new to blank, and i am currently working on a project. this project would be to create (among other things) a program to correct a text. i am having difficulty combining two separate ideas and parts of code together. first of all, i have been experimenting with a code to correct a word that is inputted by a user...the code can be found here..so far, i am using this exact code without any modifications. ..my goal is to be able to read a text file and go through it and find and propose corrections for the words which are wrong, as this spellchecker code does. ..i would use something like:..    with open('words.txt','r') as f:.        for line in f:.            for word in line.split()...to go through the text file and split it into individual words. ..ideally, if my text said .""wgat is the definiton"" i would want to be able to recognize wgat and correct it to what, and recognize definiton and correct to definition. ..how do i combine these two ideas? thanks"
