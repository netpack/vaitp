"how to access list/dictionary in a function from a different function i'm new to blank and i was wondering if there's a way for me to access a list or dictionary with data already stored in it from a different function. ..i was wondering if there's a way for me to make the list global so i can access it outside the function, or any other alternative solution. ..def upload():.    numlist = [1,2,3,4]..def add():.   for i in numlist:.       print(i)"
