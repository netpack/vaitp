"get type of data stored in a string in blank is there any way to understand what data type that a string holds... the question is of little logic but see below cases..varname = '444'.somefunc(varname) =&gt; int..varname = 'somestring'.somefunc(varname) =&gt; string..varname = '1.2323'.somefunc(varname) =&gt; float...my case:.i get a mixed data in a list but they're in string format...mylist = ['1', '2', '1.2', 'string']...i'm looking for a generic way to understand whats their data so that i can add respective comparison. since they're already converted to string format, i cant really call the list (mylist) as mixed data... but still is there a way?"
