"how to divide blank files? i am building a cli web scraping application in blank that should gather data for stock traders. it should do the following:...call reddit's api to get news about stocks..call twitter's api to get tweets about stocks..call yahoo's api to get price data about stocks..call google trends to get ""popularity over time"" for stocks....each one of those actions has its own imports. also, all of those actions will be triggered by a cli. ..what makes sense to me is that each action will be structured in a single .py file of its own with probably a single class per file...then in the main.py would have a cli class that initiates other classes according to the user's flags and arguments.   ...is my logic correct here? .what other things should i be considering?.what directories should i include those files in and what other directories should i be having?"
