"adding punctuations inside dictionary values? i have a dictionary as output that has some numerics:..example_dict = dict{'x': ordereddict, 'y': ordereddict}..print(example_dict)..example_dict = {'x': ordereddict(['value1', '100000', .                                  'value2', '10000', .                                  'value3', '1000']).                'y': ordereddict(['value4', '2000', .                                  'value5', '20000', .                                  'value6', '200000'])}...and i would like blank to print this output with commas automatically assigned to the proper places so that the new output becomes:..example_dict = {'x': ordereddict(['value1', '100,000', .                                  'value2', '10,000', .                                  'value3', '1000']).                'y': ordereddict(['value4', '2000', .                                  'value5', '20,000', .                                  'value6', '200,000'])}...these values can be random throughout the dictionary and not in the fashion that i described above. in some places hundred thousands are altogether missing while some have only numerals in thousands. that is, i need to define the function such that any value in the dictionary that has 5 digits inserts a ',' between the forth and the third digit and so on."
