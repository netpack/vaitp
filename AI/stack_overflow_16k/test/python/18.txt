"why the attribute of instances cannot be recognized by lambda? i create five lists for storing instances satisfying a certain condition and i intend to sort them by the instances attribute ""hours"". i can read the attribute outside the loop and run this line seperately and there is no error. however i run the block, the results say that the attributes don't exist. what causes that? how can i solve it?..  file ""f:/aalto study/semester3/programming/project_studyplan.py"", line 143, in print_course.    courselist.sort(key = lambda x: x.hours[0]).  file ""f:/aalto study/semester3/programming/project_studyplan.py"", line 143, in &lt;lambda&gt;.    courselist.sort(key = lambda x: x.hours[0]).attributeerror: 'list' object has no attribute 'hours' ...workbook trace:..in [196]: courselist[0].hours.out[196]: (9, 10)..in [199]:courselist.sort(key = lambda x: x.hours).in [200]:courselist.sort(key = lambda x: x.hours[0])...code:..    courselist = [[] for _ in range(5)].    for selected in self.course:.        if given_period == selected.period:.            course_n += 1.            courselist[selected.weekday-1].append(selected).    courselist.sort(key = lambda x: x.hours[0])...thanks to all's answer and advice, i found where the problem is and solve it completely. :)"
