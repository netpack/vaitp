"blank strip unexpected behavior i was stripping a file name in blank for routing purposes and i was getting some unexpected behavior with the blank strip function. i've read the docs and searched online but have not been able to find an explanation for the following behavior:..""getting-started.md"".strip('.md'). out[29]: 'getting-starte'...but if it is any other character aside from 'd' to the left of the period, it works properly:..""getting-startex.md"".strip('.md'). out[30]: 'getting-startex'...it seems like there is something similar to a mirroring going on 'd. md'. i'm doing a double strip to get by this for now, but i was just curious of why this occurs. ..thank you."
