"store every new output of function of for loop in new varible i have a list of 97 images of size 1000 x 1000 and i want to crop every image into 25 smaller images and make a for loop that take the first cropped image.of every image and store it into a new variable, the second cropped image of every image and stores it into another variable and so on. so i would end up with 25 variables each containing 97 cropped images. ..i have the function to crop the images but i cannot figure out how to store them into separate variables...crop_time_1 is the list with the 97 full-sized images..crop is the function which crops the images into 200x200 images..new_df = [].for i in crop_time_1:.    f = crop(i, 200, 200).    new_df.append(f)....so now i ended up with new_df of length 97 and the length of new_df[0] is 25"
