"how to manipulate a binary file and write the results into another binary file i have a binary file and when i parse it in blank, the contents will look like this:..b'x00x20x00x2ax02x01'...the data is presented in pairs and in fact the strings will be represented as byte arrays. i will be effectively dealing with binary data. in the the mentioned example there are 3 pairs (x00x20  x00x2a  x02x01). i want to change the input file and then write it into a binary file. the change is as follows:.in every pair, if the 1st item is 0, the 2nd item will be in the output file. if the 1st item is 1, the 2nd item from the previous pair will be in the output file. if the 1st item is greater than 1, then it would be more complicated. it would depend on 2 items in the same pair. for example1, if the 1st item is 2 and the 2nd item is 1, to get the number for the output, the program goes 2 items back in the output and uses that item as the output..example2: if the 1st item is 2 and the 2nd item is 2, to get the number for the output, the program goes 2 items back in the output and uses that item plus 1 item after that as the output...here is the expected output:..b'x20x2ax20'...i tried to that using the following code in blank:..data = b'x00x20x00x2ax02x01'..out = bytearray().for i in range(len(data)):.    if i % 2 !=0:.        if data[i] ==0:.        out.append(data[i+1]).        elif data[i] ==1:.        out.append(data[i-1]).        elif data[i] &gt;1:.            n = data[i].            for j in range(n):.                out.append(n[0:j])...but it did not return the expected output. since i am quite new at working with binary files, would you help me to fix it? or give me some tips to get such output?"
