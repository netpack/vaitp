"read lines from a file as a shift register with two cells in blank i need to read the lines of a file in such way that will behave as a shift register with two cell..for example:..with open(""filename"", 'r') as file:.. --first iteration--. present = line1. next  = line2.    do something.. --second iteration--. present = line2. next = line3.   do something.. --third iteration--. present = line3. next = line 4.    do someting.. and so on.......it can be done with open(file, 'r') but it does not guarantee that the file will be closed as the script may stop.due to of a ""do something"" before the last iteration...any elegant way to do it?"
