"returning a two element tuple where the first element is the combined elements of a bigram i'm working on an assignment using nlp, where i'm analyzing text from harry potter. the first element is a bigram...i'm trying to convert this:..[(('uncle', 'vernon'), 108)]...into this:..[(('uncle vernon'), 108)]...ideally, i'd like to get rid the comma and combine the two words together into a single phrase. i've tried using the split method, but since it is a tuple, i cannot. any advice?..note that the second element (108) is simply a count of how many times this phrase has appeared in the text."
