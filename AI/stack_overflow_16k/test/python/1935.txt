"how to make blank code read a certain line of text in a .txt file? so i have been fiddling around with blank and league of legends. and i found out you can make notes in game. so i thought about making blank code read a line of text from the note i made in game, like ""lux no flash"", but it doesn't  seems to be able to read it at all, it only works when i do it manually with the exact same code. here is my code:..import os.import time.def main():.    os.chdir('c:\riot games\league of legends\rads\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases\0.0.1.237').    f=open(""mynotes.txt"", ""r"").    if f.mode == 'r':.        lines=f.readlines().        text = lines[4].        time.sleep(0.1).        if text == 'lux no flash':.           print('done').        else:.            print('something went wrong').    f.close().if __name__== ""__main__"":. main()...the output is ""something went wrong"", but when i do it manually it says ""done"". i feel like blank cant read league code. maybe you guys know how to do this... this is the .txt file im trying to access:..##################################################.2018-09-13_18-57-33_.##################################################.lux no flash"
