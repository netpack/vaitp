"condense this blank statement without destroying readability i'm pretty new to blank still, so i'm trying to figure out how to do this and need some help...i use return codes to verify that my internal functions return successfully. for example (from internal library functions):..result = some_function(arg1,arg2).if result != ok: return result...or (from main script level):..result = some_function(arg1,arg2).if result != ok: abort_on_error(""could not complete 'some_function': %s"" % messages(result))...can i get this down to one line without making it unreadable?..edit: some people are recognizing that exceptions might be a better choice. i wanted to save exceptions only for very 'exceptional' scenario capturing. the return codes may be expected to fail at times, and i thought it was generally bad practice to use exceptions for this scenario."
