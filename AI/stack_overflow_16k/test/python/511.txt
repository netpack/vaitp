"how to decrement an entire csv column with blank - what am i doing wrong? i am very new to programming so please be patient with me...i am reading from a .csv like so:..1, -2.2, 3.3, -6.4, 5.5, 7...and so on.  my goal here, essentially is just to delete the first row, and then decrement the remaining first column by 1, so i'd have something like....1, 3.2, -6.3, 5.4, 7.5, *some randomly generated number*...here is what i have so far:..del data[0] ..for i in range(len(data)):..  newtime = data[i][0] - 1.  oldnum = data[0][1].  data.insert(i, [newtime, oldnum])...however this is just taking 1, 3 and inserting it len(data) times.. what am i doing wrong?  please don't be mean, i really am trying to learn!..i was using this as guidance: http://docs.blank.org/release/1.5.1p1/tut/range.html, and to me it seems like this should work.. :/ haaaalp!"
