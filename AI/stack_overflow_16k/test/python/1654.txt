"how can i read files with similar names on blank, rename them and then work with them? i've already posted here with the same question but i sadly i couldn't come up with a solution (even though some of you guys gave me awesome answers but most of them weren't what i was looking for), so i'll try again and this time giving more information about what i'm trying to do. ..so, i'm using a program called gmat to get some outputs (.txt files with numerical values). these outputs have different names, but because i'm using them to more than one thing i'm getting something like this: ..gmatd_1.txt.gmatd_2.txt.gmatf_1.txt.gmatf_2.txt...now, what i need to do is to use these outputs as inputs in my code. i need to work with them in other functions of my script, and since i will have a lot of these .txt files i want to rename them as i don't want to use them like './path/etc'...so what i wanted was to write a loop that could get these files and rename them inside the script so i can use these files with the new name in other functions (outside the loop). ..so instead of having to this individually: ..gmatds1= './path/gmatd_1.txt'.gmatds2= './path/gmatd_2.txt'...i wanted to write a loop that would do that for me. ..i've already tried using a dictionary: ..import os.import fnmatch..dict = {}..for filename in os.listdir('.'):.    if fnmatch.fnmatch(filename, 'thing*.txt'):.        examples[filename[:6]] = filename...this does work but i can't use the dictionary key outside the loop."
