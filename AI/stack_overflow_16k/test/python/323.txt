"outdated blank-tool? obvious mistake? im tryin to use the following tool:https://code.google.com/p/pymsi2lmp/source/browse/#svn%2ftrunk%2fsrc%2fcompass-fit..one of its modules raises an error...heres the source:..#!/usr/bin/blank.sys.path.append(sys.path[0] +'/../pymsi2lmp').import pymsi2lmp.from modify_frc import term_parameter_count as count..# calls pymsi2lmp and returns the which parameters are missing and.# the total number of unknown coefficients..def call_msi2lmp(model, frc):.    missing = pymsi2lmp.msi2lmp(model, frc).    #print ""missing:"".    #print missing.    unknown = {}.    for m in missing:.        if not m[0] in unknown: unknown[m[0]] = [].        unknown[m[0]].append(m[1])..    ct = sum([sum([count(m,a) for a in unknown[m]]) for m in unknown]).    return unknown,ct...im getting the following error: ..typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'nonetype'...im not very familiar with blank and the sum-command at the bottom is too complicated for me with that implicit loops etc...do you see an obvious mistake here, or is this something more complex, depending on the other modules?..any hints?..thx in advance"
