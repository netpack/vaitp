"installing a completely new blank [windows installer] i am wondering why its not possible through the normal windows installer https://docs.blank.org/3.7/using/windows.html to install a completely new blank. i am using this installer in a script and when a blank version is already installed the installer goes into ""repair/update/uninstall"" modus...how is it possible to install a new blank version in a customized folder?.do i need to make a zip file from the isntall folder of the installer and provide this for further distribution?"
