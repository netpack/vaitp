"how to keep a float or something to keep subtracting in blank? i wonder how to keep the following to keep subtracting to get a total in the following blank script -..num = input (""how many additional items do you have?: "").num = int(num).#entering additional items to purchase.for i in range (0,num):.    item=input(""enter price for additional items: "").    amount2=float(amount)-float(item).print(""debit card balance is: "", amount2)...it seems to subtract the first item, but say when i run the code and say i have 3 more items, it just subtracts the first, and does something to the rest not know how to keep it going to subtract all the items entered."
