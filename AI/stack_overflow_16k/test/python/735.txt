"how to control newport controller model 8742 with blank? i have the newport new focus picomotor controller/driver, model 8742, and it comes with software to control the motors. i want to be able to command the controller with blank. there is a similar question here already but for some reason that code is not working for me. so far i have..import serial as s.from time import sleep..try:.    s.serial.close().except:.    pass.    ser= s.serial('comx',baudrate=921600,timeout=1.0,parity=s.parity_none,stopbits=s.stopbits_one,bytesize=s.eightbits).    command = '1pau0.00rn'.    bcommand = bytes(command,'utf-8').    a = ser.write(bcommand).    sleep(0.1).    print(ser.read(10)).    ser.close() ...part of the problem is that i'm not sure what port number i put in the code where 'comx' is inserted. this is my first time using blank for serial communication, so any help is appreciated. thank you."
