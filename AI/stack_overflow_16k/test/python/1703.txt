"how do i store variables in a file so that they keep their values where i can print them out in the program? i'm wanting to store values in a file so that they maintain their properties. please see a snippet of my code below...        if selection == (""1""):.            newuserid = input (""please enter their 3 digit id: "").            #check the user has put in numbers and at least 3 digits.            newusername = input(""please enter the employees name: "").            #check for string not number. has to be exactly their name.            newuserpassword = input (""please enter their clocking in password: "").            count = count + 1.            uniqueuserid = (newuserid, newusername, newuserpassword, count).            uniqueuserid = str(uniqueuserid).            file.write(uniqueuserid).            file.close()...i'm using blank and also need to make it so that the user's inputs are stored in a ""count"" variable to keep track of how many users there are...thanks."
