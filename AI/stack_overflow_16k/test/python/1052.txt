"drop the lowest score and give back the average i need a program that takes a list of lists and drops the lowest score out of the list and prints the average scores..for example if given: [[100,0,100] , [50,50,0]  , [0,0,0]].it should print:..average for row 0 is 100.0.average for row 1 is 50.0.average for row 2 is 0.0...so far i have this but it doesn't allow me to enter a list of lists and it doesn't print to the corresponding rows...def averages (listofscores):.    numofrows = 0.    for number in listofscores:.            scores = (sum (listofscores) - min (listofscores)) / ((len (listofscores)) - 1).            rows = listofscores [0].            if rows &gt;=0:.                print ('average for row', numofrows, 'is', scores).                numofrows = numofrows + 1.            else:.                return none"
