"compute possible combinations of an equation i've got a template of equations template = (a op b) op c where the available operations op are the following: op = ['+', '-', '/', '*']. ..what i want to do is to compute all the possible combinations of this equation using the operations op and the parameters a, b and c. ..e.g. ..(a + b) + c.(a - b) - c.(a * b) * c.(a / b) / c.(a + c) + b.(a - c) + b.(b * a) - c...............i had a look at itertools.combinations however i am not quite sure if (or how) i can use this function in this particular context."
