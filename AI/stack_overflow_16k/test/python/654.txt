"count number of substrings found in string i've got the following function which checks to see if any of the strings in b is present in a. this works fine. ..a = ""a b c d c"".b = [""a"", ""c"", ""e""]..if any(x in a for x in b):.    print true.else:.    print false...i would like to modify it to tell me how many of the strings in b where found in a, which in this case is 2 - a and c. although c is found twice, it shouldn't make a difference...how can i do this?"
