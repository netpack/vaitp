"how to multiply every other list item by 2 in blank i'm making a program that validates a credit card, by multiplying every other number in the card number by 2; after i'll add the digits multiplied by 2 to the ones not multiplied by 2. all of the double digit numbers are added by the sum of their digits, so 14 becomes 1+4. i have a photo below that explains it all. i'm making a blank program that does all of the steps. i've done some code below for it, but i have no idea what to do next? please help, and it would be greatly appreciated. the code i have returns an error anyway. ....class validator():.    def __init__(self):.        count = 1.        self.card_li = [].        while count &lt;= 16:.            try:.                self.card = int(input(""enter number ""+str(count)+"" of your card number: "")).                self.card_li.append(self.card).                #print(self.card_li).                if len(str(self.card)) &gt; 1:.                    print(""only enter one number!"").                    count -= 1.            except valueerror:.               count -= 1   .        count += 1.        self.validate()..    def validate(self):.        self.card_li.reverse().        #print(self.card_li).        count = 16.        while count &gt;= 16:.            self.card_li[count] = self.card_li[count] * 2.            count += 2.......validator()"
