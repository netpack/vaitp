"what is the behavior of os.path.join() with unc path? can someone explain the rules of joining path, i am confusing with these results:  ..print(os.path.join('\\192.168.1.1\a\b', 'c\d', '\e')) #\192.168.1.1ae, b,c,d are thrown away.print(os.path.join('\\192.168.1.1\', 'c\d', '\e')) #\192.168.1.1\e, c, d are thrown away.print(os.path.join('\\192.168.1.1', 'c\d', '\e')) #e, \192.168.1.1 is thrown away.print(os.path.join('c:\a\b', 'c\d', '\e')) #c:e, a, b, c, d are thrown away"
