"defining dynamic functions to a string i have a small blank script which i use everyday......it basically reads a file and for each line i basically apply different string functions like strip(), replace() etc....im constanstly editing the file and commenting to change the functions. depending on the file i'm dealing with, i use different functions. for example i got a file where for each line, i need to use line.replace(' ','') and line.strip().....what's the best way to make all of these as part of my script? so i can just say assign numbers to each functions and just say apply function 1 and 4 for each line."
