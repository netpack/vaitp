"possible variables of a method on blank modules i am new to blank, my question is that how we can know the arguments name of a method on a module. for example, in the smpplib module page (https://github.com/podshumok/blank-smpplib) i see an example code that has a line as below ..client.bind_transceiver(system_id='login', password='secret')...i what to know how i can know that bind_transceiver function has system_id password (and system_type) variable. ..help (smpplib.client.client) just give me below info about bind_transceiver  ...  :.   bind_transceiver(self, **args).   bind as a transmitter and receiver at once"
