"how to get value on a certain index, in a blank list? i have a list which looks something like this..list = [q1,a1,q2,a2,q3,a3]...i need the final code to be something like this ..dictionary = {q1:a1,q2:a2,q3:a3}...if only i can get values at a certain index e.g list[0] i can accomplish this, is there any way i can get it?"
