"blank 2.7: typeerror: got an unexpected keyword argument - when connecting to network devices using netmiko blank version - 2.7..library used - netmiko, connecthandler is imported  from netmiko..from netmiko import connecthandler...the actual code used by netmiko to connect to devices without any function, this works fine if i dont add this to function:..connect = connecthandler(device_type=platform, ip=key, username=username, password=password).output = connect.send_command('terminal length 0', expect_string=r'#').output = connect.send_command('enable', expect_string=r'#').host_name = connect.send_command('show run | in hostname', expect_string=r'#')...i have tried to add the above code into a function named connection so it can be called at multiple places:..below is the code that i tried to connect to network devices using netmiko, instead of writing the code separately i added the netmiko connection code to a function that takes in arguments, however after the execution of first line in the function with arguments, the second line has a different command that does not need any arguments from the function itself: ..def connection(platform, key, username, password):.    connect = connecthandler(device_type=platform, ip=key, username=username, password=password).    output = connect.send_command('terminal length 0', expect_string=r'#').    output = connect.send_command('enable', expect_string=r'#').    host_name = connect.send_command('show run | in hostname', expect_string=r'#').    return connect, host_name, output..connection('cisco_xe', key , user, pass)...for example the first line that connects to the device needs four arguments ('cisco_xe', key , user, pass) that worked without issue. in the second line the argument expect_string=r'#' is required by the command, however i get the following error when the second.(output = connect.send_command('terminal length 0', expect_string=r'#') line is executed:..typeerror: commandstatus() got an unexpected keyword argument 'expect_string'"
