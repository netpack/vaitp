how do i get listoflists to be defined in this function? blank! when put in another function still does not work? how can i initialize listoflists to be defined? when i tried to put it as an empty list (listoflists = []) in a different function and run it through main() it still did not work. i'm trying to change a 2d list to a 1d list i just cannot define listoflists. .this is the code i'm trying: (blank 3.7)..def convert2list(listoflists):.    new_list = []..    for list in listoflists:.        new_list += list.    return new_list
