"getting out of a loop? i'm taking a programming class in my school, and we just started with blank. we are supposed to make our coding print a tic tac toe board using a loop, but i can't figure out how to close the loop and add one last line of coding. here is what i have so far as my coding:..bob = '+----+----+----+'.joe = '|    |    |    |'.index = 0.while index &lt; 3:.    print(bob).    print(joe).    print(joe).    index = index + 1.print(bob)...(ps the underscores are tabs in the coding.).the last line is the line that i am trying to get out of the loop. i have researched it but i everything i find doesn't work, i just get a ""syntaxerror: invalid syntax"". does anyone know how i can learn how to fix this?"
