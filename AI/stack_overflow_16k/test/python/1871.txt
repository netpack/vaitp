"how to compare the difference between two datasets vs null in blank i am creating a script that will compare an excel file to a snowflake database table. if the columns are all the same, the script will import the data from excel and append or insert to the snowflake table. i am testing with two identical spreadsheets to get the script functioning - and if i understand my code properly this script should return ""sweet"" if the there is no difference in the two files. however, it is returning ""that's all folks!"" which is the else stmt. i may be misunderstanding how none works here so any thoughts on this would be helpful...i also have a test file where i added a garbage columns (""blah"") - to make sure the script is functioning properly. i get the same result whether i compare to the identical file or the blah file. i also tried == instead of is in the if stmt and i tried passing the set1 and set2 variables into the main() function but neither of those worked...import pandas as pd..file1 = pd.read_excel('./excel/file1.xlsx', sheet_name = 'export',index_col = 0).file2 = pd.read_excel('./excel/file2.xlsx', sheet_name = 'export',index_col = 0)..set1 = set(file1.columns).set2 = set(file2.columns)..def main():.    if set1.difference(set2) == none:.        print(""sweet"").    else: .        print(""that's all folks!"").main()...what i am looking to achieve is if the files have any difference in the columns, it should register with the function so that i can have it throw an error. if the columns match, then it's safe to pass through the function and ultimately write to snowflake...update: comparing set1.difference(set2) to set() instead of none did the trick."
