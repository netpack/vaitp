"change a variable in a for loop from 0 to 2, and back again to 0 hi i am looking for a smart way to get a for loop in blank in which one variable, say k, has to shift from 0 to 2 and than back to 0 up to the end of the loop. something like ..k = 0.for j in range(15):.    fancycode.    k = k + 1...in which for each loop k has the following values..loop1 k = 0.loop2 k = 1.loop3 k = 2.loop4 k = 0.loop5 k = 1.loop6 k = 2.loop7 k = 0.......i may use an if statement but i would like to know whether there could be something smart that does not burden my code"
