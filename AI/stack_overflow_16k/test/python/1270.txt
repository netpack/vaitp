"how does blank pass keyword changes values in list? i have one small program in blank. i have created list and i am passing it as function parameter. according to me it should give output as 1 2 3 4 5. but it is giving me 5 2 3 4 5 as output. if i am just writing 'pass' keyword inside for loop then it should not do anything.then why is that changing my output?..here is my code:..def fun1(list1):.    for list1[0] in list1: .        pass.list2=[1,2,3,4,5].fun1(list2).print(list2)"
