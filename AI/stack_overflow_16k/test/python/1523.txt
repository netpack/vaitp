"blank graph representation if i have a directed graph whose vertices are denoted by {1,2,3,...} and the connections between them are like this:(meaning there is a directed edge from b to a represented as a&lt;-b)..list1: 1&lt;-2&lt;-3&lt;-4&lt;-5&lt;-6.list2: 2&lt;-4&lt;-7&lt;-6.list3: 1&lt;-8&lt;-7.list4: 1&lt;-9&lt;-2...the degree of vertex 4 is 2 (since it has a edge to 3 and 2), degree of 6 is 2 and so on. how can i compute this and store this in a dictionary in blank as shown below:..dict = {}.dict{4:'2', 6:'2'} ...like this..thanks in advance."
