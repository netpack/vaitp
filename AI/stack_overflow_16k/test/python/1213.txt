"setting variable as integer once i'm a beginner in coding, currently using sikuli as a tool and learning blank in a fun way. ..i asked my good friend who knows c++, he told me that what i wanna do can exactly be written in c++ as..for (int x=0; x &lt; 10)...setting the variable as integer, and having increment set in a condition. i'm not using .in range(0,10) is because i don't want the variable to be increased if my condition is not meet..so how do i set the variable x as 0 or integer only once at the top so that my function can start looping and get increment correctly when the condition is met?"
