"place randomly generated numbers into text file my task was to generate random coordinates (512 of them) within a box that is a dimension of 20x20x20. ..the program that views this 3d image, requires xyz file which is in the format of:..1000.000000 #number of coordinates.comment goes here #coment line.h 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 #1st colmun is arbitary - we'll leave it h, 2nd is x vavlue, 3rd value is y value and 4th column is z value..h 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000.h 0.000000 0.000000 2.000000.h 0.000000 0.000000 3.000000...so far i have,..import random.numpoints=512.l=20.while len(points)&lt;numpoints:.    p = (random.randint(0, l), random.randint(0, l), random.randint(0, l)).    if p not in points:.        points.add(p)...this will generate my (x,y,z) coordiantes but the problem i am having is putting it into a text file. ..i started with something like this but need some help:..with open(""question1.xyz"",""w"") as file:.     file.write(""ncomment goes heren"") #this is for the 2nd line in my xyz file.     while len(points)&lt;numpoints:.        p = (random.randint(0, l), random.randint(0, l), random.randint(0, l)).        if p not in points:.            points.add(p).                    file.write('h %f %f %fn' % (x, y, z)).....this is what i have to create my out put and put the number of lines is placed on the first line but for some reasoning its not emurating my file..#this will put the number of particles as the first line and generate an output file.with open(""question2.xyz"") as infile:.    with open(""q2output.xyz"",""w"") as outfile:.        for i,line in enumerate(infile):.            if i==0:.                outfile.write('%fn'%counter).            else:.                outfile.write(line)...i figured out its because of my counter which doesn't exist, but is there a more efficient way of doing it?"
