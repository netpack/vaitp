"replacing characters in string by whitespace except digits i am trying to remove all the characters and special symbols from a string in blank except the numbers(digits 0-9). this is what i am doing-..s='das dad 67 8 - 11 2928  313'.s1=''.for i in range(0,len(s)):.    if not(ord(s[i])&gt;=48 and ord(s[i])&lt;=57):.        s1=s1+' '.    else:.        s1=s1+s[i]  .#s1=s1.split()      .print(s1)   ...so, basically i am checking the ascii codes for each character, if they do not lie in the range of digits' ascii values, i update them by whitespace. this works fine, but i was curious if there is some other more efficient way i can do this in blank...edit i want to replace non-digit characters with whitespace"
