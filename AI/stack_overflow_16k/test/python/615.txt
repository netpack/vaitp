"blank webbrowser library i happened run into a blank standard library, &lt;webbrowser>. i tried the example there, and it opened up a new browser and went to the page i wanted. however, there is isn't any further extra functions from the package, like close, switch tab, etc...blank -m webbrowser -t ""http://www.blank.org""...is that all the library does or it is just me underestimating the true power of this package?"
