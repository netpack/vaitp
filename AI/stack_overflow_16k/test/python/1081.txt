"assigning values conditionally (with multiple conditions) as a follow-on to this original question:.blank: stripping elements of a string array based on first character of each element..i'm wondering if i can expand this if statement:..with open(bom_filename, 'r') as my_file:.    file_array = [word.strip() for word in my_file if word.startswith(""/"")]...to include and 2nd condition:..with open(bom_filename, 'r') as my_file:.    file_array = [word.strip() for word in my_file if (word.startswith(""/"")) &amp; not(word.endswith(""/""))]...this generates a syntax error but i hope there's some alternative syntax i can use!"
