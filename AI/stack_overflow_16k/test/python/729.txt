"my blank 3 environment is building a blank 2 wheel i have blank 2.7 and 3.7 installed on windows 10...in the end i set up completely separate environments for each, and each version appears to be comfortable in its own environment...my task is to migrate some libraries from 2.7 to 3.x...in my 2.7 environment i can build the libraries with no problems...as i've just started this task i've run my source code through 2to3, and not much more..there is nothing to indicate any issues with the conversion...i then attempt to build a wheel in my blank 3.7 environment..setup.py contains ..blank_requires='>=3.7'..and the classifiers explicitly state ..""programming language :: blank :: 3""..i run ..setup.py bdist_wheel..my setup.py is set to bail out if blank 3.7 is not used with the setup file...the wheel that is generated is my_library_-py2-none-any.whl..my pip version is 19.0.3...i don't want to upgrade pip as i want to be sure of 2.7 support and i know i'll  be stuck with 2.7 for a good while to come...why is my wheel indicating blank 2 support only?"
