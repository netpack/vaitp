"changing duplicate values in blank i have a dictionary of lists of numbers, e.g.:..tdict = {1:[400,200,400,100,0],2:[100,200,300,400,400],3:[200,200,200,100,100]}...i am not allowed to have duplicate values in the lists so my strategy is to iterate through and replace duplicate values with incremented values. this would produce:..{1:[400,200,401,100,0],2:[100,200,300,400,401],3:[200,201,202,100,101]...i have tried multiple combinations of counters etc to achieve this:..for k,v in tdict.items():.    for x in range(len(v)):.        for y in range(len(v):.            if v[x]==v[y] and y!0.                v[y]+=1...etc. (im pretty new to blank as you can probably guess). any help would be greatly appreciated."
