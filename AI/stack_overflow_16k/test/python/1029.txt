"blank: removing elements from a list inside an iterator? i am trying to remove elements from a list in blank. most answers seem to suggest that using a list iterator is best, but i don't think it's possible (or at least elegant) for my problem. ..i want to iterate over the test_data list and delete any items that meet the following two conditions: (1) have an attribute total:sum (2) have an attribute (pagepath) that starts with, but is not equal to, any element in the list mystrings...here is my list of strings, and my test data:..    mystrings = [u'/calculate-state-pension', u'/check-uk-visa'].    test_data = [.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/check-uk-visa"",.            ""total:sum"": 2.0.        },.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/check-uk-visa/y"",.            ""total:sum"": 3.0.        },.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/check-uk-visa/n"",.            ""total:sum"": 4.0.        },.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/bank-holidays"",.            ""total:sum"": 2.0.        },.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/check-uk-visa"",.            ""searchuniques:sum"": 2.0.        }.    ]...so i would like to end up with this list:..    results = [.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/check-uk-visa"",.            ""total:sum"": 2.0.        },.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/bank-holidays"",.            ""total:sum"": 2.0.        },.        {.            ""pagepath"": ""/check-uk-visa"",.            ""searchuniques:sum"": 2.0.        }.    ]...this is my code:..    results = test_data[:].    for r in results_copy:.        for s in mystrings:.            if 'total:sum' in r and r['pagepath'].startswith(s) .                 and r['pagepath'] != s:.                results.remove(r).    return results...but this doesn't seem to work. it removes the element with /check-uk-visa/y but not the one with /check-uk-visa/n. ..what am i doing wrong? i think it's something to do with the deleting and the iterator - it looks like it's skipping elements."
