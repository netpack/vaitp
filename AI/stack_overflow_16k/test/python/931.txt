"check a line value in blank from a file so i have this .txt file that has over 100 lines and a value on each one..how would i read the value from a specific line and use it in an if?.let's say i want to read the line 34 and see if the line has the value 0 or 1 in it. i don't really know how to explain but i was thinking about something like this. would i be able to assign ""print(lines[34])"" an integer and then compare the integer with 0 or 1? please keep in mind that i have no experience with blank. ..f = open(""nt.txt"",'r').lines = f.readlines().if print(lines[34]) == 1:.    print(""something"")"
