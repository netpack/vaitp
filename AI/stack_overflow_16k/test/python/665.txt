"how to run a blank script online every n minutes? to work a bit on my blank, i decided to try to code a simple script for my private use which monitors sites with offers and sends you an email whenever a new offer which you are interested in pops out. i guess i could handle the coding part (extracting the newest one from html and such) but i've never really run online any script which requires being fired every n minutes or so. what kind of hosting/server do i need to make my script run independently of my computer and refresh every, say, 5 minutes sending me an email when there's an update?"
