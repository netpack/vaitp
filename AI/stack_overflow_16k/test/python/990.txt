how to count the precise line number in a file with blank? this is the code i use to count lines in a file. i don't think it is wrong. but why the result is always one line more than i check directly using gedit ? i can just minus 1 to get the right result but i want to know why...        file = open(filename).        alllines = file.read().        file.close().        lines=alllines.split('n').        linecount = len(lines)
