"blank random.randint stops randomizing after a few loops i'm running a blank script that will display messages on a board.  one of the subroutines that i've created is supposed to grab a random line from a small text file, and display that line.  it mostly works, except after looping a few times, it gets stuck on the same number, and just displays the same thing over and over...i am running this in blank 2.7, on a raspberry pi in raspbian.  i am using this github as the base for the project, and added lines of my own to it: .        https://github.com/calebkussmaul/stranger-things-integrated.this is part of a halloween display that will be stranger things-themed, so the preloaded messages have a reference to the show.  i noticed this issue the other day, and have been pouring over the internet to try and figure out what the problem could be.  i've tried doing different methods of selecting a randomized number, including some in some similar (but different) threads on this site.  all of them produce exactly the same issue...below is the subroutine i created:..def preloaded_messages():.    print ""preloaded messages thread is loaded."".    global displaying.    while true:.        if not displaying:.            with open('preloaded_messages.txt') as f:.                lines = len(f.readlines()).                rgn = random.randint(1,lines).                msg = linecache.getline('preloaded_messages.txt', rgn).                print ""rng: "", rgn.                print ""total lines: "", lines.                print ""line: "", msg.            print ""displaying from preloaded_messages.txt: "", msg.            display(msg).        time.sleep(10)...and here's my preloaded_messages.txt file:..help me.im trapped in the upside down.leggo my eggo.friends dont lie.run /!.hopper is alive.rip barb.demogorgon is coming /!.mouthbreather...when i run it, my output is like this:..rng:  6.total lines:  9.line:  hopper is alive..rng:  2.total lines:  9.line:  im trapped in the upside down..rng:  9.total lines:  9.line:  mouthbreather.......rng:  9.total lines:  9.line:  mouthbreather...the first few times are always random (and the number of times it successfully randomizes varies), but when it gets on 9, it just stays there for as long as i let it run.  i am at a loss as to why it works the first few times, but not once it gets to 9...edit: interestingly, as i've been writing this, i also tried adding a blank line at the end, and while it looked like it'd be stuck again, as it did that one three times in a row, then it finally moved to others.  i'm not sure how that changes things. and ideally, i'd rather not have the blank line in there, as it eats up time displaying nothing.  so it'd be nice to fix the issue.  anyone have any ideas?"
