"blank inspect and functions i am trying to go through the json module and return just the functions. and then i would like to use inspect module to return inspect.formatargspec(*inspect.getfullargspec(func)) on each function from json...this is what i was thinking, this obviously fails because func is a string...import inspect.import json as m ..for func in dir(m):..    if inspect.isfunction(func):.        print(func)"
