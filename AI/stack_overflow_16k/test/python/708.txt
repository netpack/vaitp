"using a file to create a list but the file has variables in it. how do i make the list contain the variable's value? i'm writing a script that contains a large list. i'm trying to modify my script so that instead of needing to edit the script directly to add/remove items to this list, it reads lines from a text file. is it possible to use variables inside of this data file?..for example,.if my text file contains this:..thing.number+str(variable)...and my script looks like this:..import os..variable = '123456'.file = 'c:whatever.txt'..#make the list 'commands'.with open(file) as f:.        commands = [].        for line in f:.                line = line.replace('n','').                commands.append(line)..#make the list 'oldcommands'.oldcommands = ['thing','number'+str(variable)]..print(commands).print(oldcommands)...how do i get both of these outputs to be the same? ..this is the result of running the script above:..['thing', 'number+str(variable)'].['thing', 'number123456']...formatting the file in a particular way is not a problem, i'm just trying to make my script more modular/portable"
