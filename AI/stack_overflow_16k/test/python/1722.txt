"blank append to list from return tuple i have a list and a function f which returns a 3-tuple.   i would like to capture the first two return values, and with the third, append to lst.  i know i can do the following:..a, b, c = f().lst.append(c)...but i would like a way not to have the extraneous variable ""c"".  i know i can also do:..lst.append(f()[2])...but i do not want to throw away the other two return values..any suggestions?..edit: i appreciate the answers provided, but the question, put more clearly, is to find a neat one-liner."
