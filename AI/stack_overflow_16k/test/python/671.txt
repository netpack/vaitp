"how to i check the next line in text file input in my elif not block i need to check the next line of the text file because the code keeps on checking the same file id and gets stuck in this section. the text file gives the wanted location and name of a file that exists in a separate folder(filesfolder). these files need to be moved to a existing empty tree to the correct subdirectory...import os  ..import os.path.import shutil.from pathlib import path.data_folder = path(""c:/users/folder"").filesfolder = path(""c:/users/files"").file_to_open = data_folder / ""text.txt"".rootfolder = ""topfolder"".newfoldertree = data_folder / rootfolder..with open(file_to_open) as f:.    #striping the whitespace and extracting important parts..    line = f.readline().strip().    fold_location = line.split(""~"")[0].    file_id = line.split(""   "")[1].    while line:.    # iterating through files that need to be sorted..    for file in os.listdir(filesfolder):.    # extracting the name, ignoring revision,extension(.zip,.pdf etc) and dashes..    file_name = file.split('_')[0].split('-')[0].split('.')[0].        for file_id in f: .            if file_name == file_id:.    #  check if the folder exists then copy the file to the corresponding folder in new tree..                 for root, dirs, subdirs in os.walk(newfoldertree):.                     if fold_location.exists():.                         dest = path(fold_location).                         # copy files occurs here.                     shutil.copy(file, dest).                     elif not subdir.exists():.                         print(""folder does not exist for "" + fold_location)..             elif not file_name == file_id:.             # how do i check the next line from text file?...             # gets to end of text file..             else: .                 print('the following document is missing ' + file_name )"
