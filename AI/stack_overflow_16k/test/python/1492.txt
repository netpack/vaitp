"blank checking if file exists (returns false, should return true) i have following line of code:..tfpath = '""' + os.environ[""programfiles(x86)""] + 'microsoft visual studio 12.0common7idetf.exe""'.if not os.path.exists(tfpath):.    tfpath = 'tf.exe'.cmd_str = '""' + tfpath + ' checkout ' + '""files_to_checkout""""'...i tested with the file as described being there, in ""c:program files (x86)microsoft visual studio 12.0common7idetf.exe"". but my code always jumped into the true branch, so it never acknowledged that the file was actually there. what did i do wrong there?..note, for testing purposes, i did a os.system(cmd_str) with the original tfpath, which worked fine, so the file exists, it could be accessed, but the path.os.exists returns false every time."
