"blank's pool map hangs when subprocess killed i'm banging my head on more than a day now, trying to understand why my program's children can't raise any exception and simply die, instead of making the whole pool hangs. let me add that i searched on the internet for hours, haven't found something related...let's consider as an example:..#!/opt/perforce/bin/blank/3.4.2/bin/blank3..import multiprocessing.import sys...def run(i):.    print(i).    sys.exit(1)..iteration = ['test1', 'test2', 'test3']..with multiprocessing.pool(1) as pool:.    pool.map(run, iteration).    print(""reached here ?"")...with the sys.exit(), the print is never reached, pool.map hangs blocks for some reasons. on my real script, the sys.exit() has been added when i catch some kind of errors. i'd like to be able to gracefully kill a worker (or simply make it skip the iteration, like a break). i tried sys.exit(), exit() or even os.kill(), but no luck.....is it possible?"
