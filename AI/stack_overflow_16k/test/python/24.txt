"whats new in blank 3.x? http://docs.blank.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html says it lists whats new, but in my opinion, it only lists differences, so has does anybody know of any completely new blank features, introduced in release 3.x?..to avoid confusion, i will define a completely new feature as something that has never been used in any other code before, somehting you walk up to and go ""ooh, shiny!"". e.g. a function to make aliens invade, etc."
