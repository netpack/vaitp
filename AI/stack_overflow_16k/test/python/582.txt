"high scores function issues i am trying to create a high scores list for a little trivia game for class. i'm having an issue though because i can't seem to get the printed output to not just print the dictionary randomly.  this snippet is not actually from the full program because i didn't want to ruin anything so it's just an attempt at reasoning out the function...scores = {'score1': {'initials': 'ywo',.                     'score': 20},.          'score2': {'initials': 'jrv',.                     'score': 18},.          'score3': {'initials': 'blh',.                     'score': 16},.          'score4': {'initials': 'yth',.                     'score': 15},.          'score5': {'initials': 'rtg',.                     'score': 12}}..total_score = 17...#iterates over the scores to see if new score and initials should be input.for i in (scores):.        if total_score &gt; scores[i]['score']:.        scores[i]['initials'] = 'jke'.        scores[i]['score'] = total_score.        break..#prints scores in a table like format rather than list.print(""hightscores"").for i in scores:.    print(scores[i]['initials'], ""t"", scores[i]['score'])...my output is random every time though.  i just want the dictionary to print in order of highest to lowest eg:..ywo    20 .jrv    18 .jke    17...etc etc  ..the other issue i am having is that i'm not sure how to approach moving the other scores lower in the dictionary.  so if jke's score replaces the score at blh, blh isn't just removed from the dictionary but it moves down to score4 index and score4 values would move to score5 etc etc.  i appreciate any advice!  thank you!"
