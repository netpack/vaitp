passing variables between files in blank i am quite new to blank but i have been given some code by a group project teammate that i need to integrate with my own code. the main programme is contained in a main.py file which imports variables from a settings.py file. main.py also imports functions from functions.py file. functions.py also imports variables from settings.py. my own code requires iteration so i need to be able to change the settings.py variables when running main.py to solve the problem. ideally i can find a way to adjust my teammates code to become a function that i can simply pass variables into and out of...i have tried to import variables from main.py to settings.py but that results in cyclic importing. i can't find any solutions and not for lack of trying and would really appreciate any help...main.py.import settings.import function.settings.x=10.print(settings.x+function.y)...settings.py.x=1..function.py.import settings.y= settings.x...effectively i want this to print out 20 and not 11.
