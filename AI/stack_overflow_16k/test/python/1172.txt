"spark-like methods for groupby in blank after using spark for a while,  trying to use groupby() in plain blank seems unnecessary complicated ..i use this code..([ (k,list(v)) .   for k,v in itertools.groupby(.                                sorted(.                                       data.                                       ,key=itemgetter(0)).                                ,key=itemgetter(0))].)...without sorting the data first, it gives a wrong answer (considers the key to be in compact continuous regions)...i understand the point of providing an iterable, but it forces me to build explicitly a list every time...i know i can simply go and plug this in a method, but is there a more compact and efficient way of achieving this?"
