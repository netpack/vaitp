"return to the top of a loop at print(""you dont have that many cards!"") i want the while loop to start over from..print(""how many cards in heap no:"", n, end="""")...instead of breaking. how can this be done?..y = [].def cardheaps():.    global cards.    n = 1.    while int(cards) &gt; 0:.        print(""how many cards in heap no:"", n, end="""").        x = int(input(""? "")).        cards = int(cards).        if x &gt; cards:.            print(""you dont have that many cards!"").            break.        y.append(x).        cards -= int(x).        print(cards, "" cards left"").        n += 1.        if cards &lt;= 0:.            print(""out of cards!"").            break"
