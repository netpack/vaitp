"define blank imports only once for all files in the same folder, is it possible? suppose i do some data analysis within a particular folder. some juypter notebooks some .py files. is it possible (and does it makes sense) to define the imports globally in one file ? e.g. import numpy as np and now i can use np.whatever in every file ? maybe this is a stupid question but a colleague of mine who is using r, asked me this question and i never thought of that idea...edit: for the downvoters: i really tried to find that out my searching on the net but could not find any information. i thought that this would not be a good idea but who knows."
