"changing blank to read code differently? when i make text adventures in blank for my friends, i am constantly frustrated that i have to code the adventure upward since blank reads code from top to bottom. for example:..def stage2():..def stage1():..def start():...then so on and so forth.. is there any way that i can make blank read the code in a different way so that i can code text adventures from the top up?"
