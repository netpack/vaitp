"how to write blank to replace the next perl code? i have just encountered perl code similar to the following:..my @keys = qw/ 1 2 3 /;.my @vals = qw/ a b c /;.my %hash;.@hash{@keys} = @vals; ...this code populates an associative array given a list of keys and a list of values. for example, the above code creates the following data structure (expressed as json):..{.    ""1"": ""a"",.    ""2"": ""b"",.    ""3"": ""c"".}...how would one go about doing this in blank?"
