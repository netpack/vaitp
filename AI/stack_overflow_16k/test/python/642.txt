"blank - how can i find out if a specific xml node is present using blank? here is a sample of some xml code i have:..&lt;vast version=""2.0""&gt;.&lt;ad id=""602678""&gt;.&lt;inline&gt;.&lt;adsystem&gt;acudeo compatible&lt;/adsystem&gt;.&lt;adtitle&gt;nonlinear test campaign 1&lt;/adtitle&gt;.&lt;description&gt;nonlinear test campaign 1&lt;/description&gt;.&lt;creatives&gt;.&lt;creative adid=""602678-nonlinear""&gt;.&lt;/creative&gt;.&lt;/creatives&gt;.&lt;/inline&gt;.&lt;/ad&gt;.&lt;/vast&gt;...this xml is served online so i hit a specific url in order to get this data back. however, in some cases, nothing is returned so i am looking for a way to verify whether or not the ""creatives"" node is present in whatever is returned at any given time. i have tried beautifulsoup with no luck but i think that is more for html rather than xml. any help is greatly appreciated, thanks."
