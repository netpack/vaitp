"import directory containing blank src files as module i've a question on importing a blank directory foo as a module. the structure is:  ...  -- foo    .  .  .    --__init__.py.    --- file1.py.    --- file2.py.  ...__init__.py contains the following line:.__all__ = [""file1"", ""file2""]..what i would want to do is to import foo and then access file1 as foo.file1 .however, i can only access file1 after doing:.from foo import *.there's a way by which i can access file1 through foo.file1, it is:.from foo import *.import foo.as you can see this is quite inefficient. can someone point me to what is the right way to do what i am aiming to do...thanks"
