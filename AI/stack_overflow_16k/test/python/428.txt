"why is my method operator returning none i'm writing a polynomial class and having trouble with my getitem operator .here is my code for my getitem: ..def __getitem__(self, idx):.        for i in range(len(self.coeffs)):.            if self.coeffs[i][1] == idx:.                return (self.coeffs[i][0]).                break...and here is my test code: .. for i in range(p1.degree() + 1):.            if p1[i] != 0:.                print(p1[i], end = "" "")...the polynomial is 6x^14+9x^11-12x^3+42 and it returns all the nonzero coefficients however i get the output like this ..42 none none -12 none none none none none none none 9 none none 6 ...so my question is how can i only display the coeffients and also why is none showing up anyways?"
