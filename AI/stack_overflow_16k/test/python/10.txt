"idiomatic blank iterating and adding to a dict i'm running through a string, creating all substrings of size 10, and adding them to a dict. this is my code,..sequence_map = {}.for i in range(len(s)):.    sub = s[i:i+10].    if sub in sequence_map:.       sequence_map[sub] += 1.    else:.       sequence_map[sub] = 1...is there a way to do this more blankically?..also how do i do the reverse blankically, as in interating through the dict and composing a list where value is equal to something?..[k for k, v in sequence_map.items()]"
