"blank 3 typeerror: must be str, not bytes with sys.stdout.write() i was looking for a way to run an external process from blank script and print its stdout messages during the execution..the code below works, but prints no stdout output during runtime. when it exits i am getting the following error:...  sys.stdout.write(nextline) typeerror:must be str,not bytes...p = subprocess.popen([""demo.exe""],stdout = subprocess.pipe, stderr= subprocess.pipe)    .# poll process for new output until finished.while true:.    nextline = p.stdout.readline().    if nextline == '' and p.poll() != none:.        break.    sys.stdout.write(nextline).    sys.stdout.flush()..output = p.communicate()[0].exitcode = p.returncode...i am using blank 3.3.2"
