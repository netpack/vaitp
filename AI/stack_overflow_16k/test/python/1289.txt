"2 names for a same attribute i would like to know if there is a way to ""link"" two attributes of a class or to give 2 names to a same attribute? ..for example, i'm actually working on a script which create triangle from data given by users. my triangle is abc. sides of this triangle are ab, bc and ca. so the triangle has got these 3 attributes (self.ab, self.bc, self.ca). but ab = ba so i would like to allow users to do print myinstance.ba instead of print myinstance.ab. ..so i thought to create the attribute self.ab and the property ba (which return self.ab). that work fine when i try to do print myinstance.ba instead of print myinstance.ab but i'm greedy... ..i also would like to allow users to do myinstance.ba = 5 instead of myinstance.ab = 5 and when doing this also edit the attribute ab...is there is a way to do this ?"
