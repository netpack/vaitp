"problems with bool, and if statements i'm building a id confirm system the user has 3 attempts to type the id correct and if not, the system will exit. and my problem is when the user is entering the correct id at the last time the third one, when the code is correct the statement write that the id is correct, and the second line is showing him, that he entered too many attempts and system is exiting. how can i fix the bug?.how could i fix, that when user types correct id at the 3/3 attempt, the system would say, correct we can break the if statement. .my code:..checkas = true.attempts = 3.currentattemp = 0.kickforbadcode = sys.exit.while checkas:.    currentattemp += 1.    idconfirm = input(""* [3nematix]: {} please confirm your id code... attempt! {}/{} "".format(vartotojo_vardas, currentattemp, attempts)).    with open (duomenubaz, mode = 'r', encoding = 'utf-8') as confirm:.        for line in confirm:.            if ""vardas: ""+vartotojo_vardas + "" password: "" + vartotojo_pass + "" id: "" + idconfirm in line.strip():.                print(""correct!"").                confirm.close().                checkas = false.                break.            elif ""vardas: ""+vartotojo_vardas + "" password: "" + vartotojo_pass + "" id: "" + idconfirm in line.strip() and currentattemp &gt; 2:.                clear().                print(""correct!"").                confirm.close().                checkas = false.                break.            elif currentattemp &gt;2:.                clear().                print(""~ you have been kicked for too many attempts!"").                checkas = false.                sys.exit"
