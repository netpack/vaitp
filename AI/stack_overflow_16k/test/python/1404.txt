"reading/writing files: is ""a"" faster than ""a+"" mode? based on many people's answer, it looks the only difference between ""a"" and ""a+"" mode is that ""a+"" is not only write/append, but also ""read"". ..from my using file open experience, without ""a+"" mode, i can do write append with ""a"" pretty well. does ""a"" give me performance improvement if i don't need read for the file at all?..for example:..with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:.    f.write('linen');"
