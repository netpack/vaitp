"how to enter a list into a function? in blank write a function called “find_even_count” which allows the user to enter an arbitrary sequence of positive integers at the keyboard, and then prints the number of positive even integers user enters. the sequence of numbers is unknown at the beginning. user may enter negative number to show the end of the sequence..for example: if user enters the sequence,.1, 3, 5, 23, 56, 14, 68, 25, 12, -1.then your function needs to print “4 even numbers”, since there are 4 even numbers in the sequence..hint: use while loop..here is my code..find_even_count(x):.    i = x.    even_count = 0.    while x&gt; 0:.            if i%2 ==0:.                    even_count+=1..    print even_count...i keep getting the error code..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""&lt;pyshell#8&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;.    find_even_count(2,22,224,24,-1).  file ""/users/rayhow/desktop/assignment2_q4.py"", line 5, in find_even_count.    if i%2 ==0:.typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'tuple' and 'int'...why am i getting this error message?"
