"how to check if a command in blank script is stuck and take alternative action? i am writing a script to shutdown oracle database..i have the below script..import cx_oracle.# need to connect as sysdba or sysoper.connection = cx_oracle.connect(""/"", mode = cx_oracle.sysdba).# first shutdown() call must specify the mode, if dbshutdown_abort is used,.# there is no need for any of the other steps.connection.shutdown(mode = cx_oracle.dbshutdown_immediate).# now close and dismount the database.cursor = connection.cursor().cursor.execute(""alter database close immediate"").cursor.execute(""alter database dismount"") .# perform the final shutdown call.connection.shutdown(mode = cx_oracle.dbshutdown_final)...in this script there is a chance that ""cursor.execute(""alter database close immediate"")"" may run for a long time in unforeseen circumstances. how can make the script wait on this for 5 mins and if does not complete take an alternative action like stop this command or execute an alternate command..thanks,.tanveer"
