"compiling and executing simple user defined code in blank i want to allow my users a way to run very simple blank functions for a project. of course, eval() comes to mind, but it is a huge risk. after thinking about it for a time, i realized that most of the functions that a user might need are very rudimentary, similar to the most common excel functions. so i was thinking something along the lines of maintaining a dictionary where the keys are the functions names, and the user can only pick functions which are defined (by me) within that dictionary. so for example:..def add(a, b):.    return a + b..def sum(numbers):.    result = 0.    for number in numbers:.        result += number.    return number.......function_map = {.    'add': add,.    'sum': sum,.    ....}...now, if a user defines a line as add(4, 5), the result is the expected 9, however, if they define something like foo(4), since the key does not exist in my dictionary, an error would be raised. my question is this: how safe is this? are there any potential vulnerabilities that i am overlooking here?"
