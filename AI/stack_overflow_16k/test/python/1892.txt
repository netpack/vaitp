"how to deep join a tuple into a string i want to convert a tuple to a semicolon-separated string. easy...tup = (1,2).';'.join(map(str,tup))...output:..'1;2'...if one of the tuple entries is itself a tuple, however, i get something like this:..'1;(2, 3)'...i don't want that comma, i want a semicolon, and also i'd like to select the parentheses characters as well...i want this:..'1;{2;3}'...is there an easy way to deep-join a tuple of tuples nested to any depth, specifying both the separator (';' in the example) and the parenthes ('{' and '}' in the example above)?..note that i do not want this, which this question was marked as a duplicate of:..'1,2,3'...i also need to handle strings with commas in them, so i can't use replace:..flatten((1,('2,3',4))).'1;{2,3;4}'"
