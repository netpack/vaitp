"trying to understand slices of lists i have a list and i want to understand slices of it. i take a slice [0:1] of it: ..&gt;&gt;&gt; l=[1,2,3,4].&gt;&gt;&gt; id(l[0]).140079803522784.&gt;&gt;&gt; id(l[0:1][0]).140079803522784...they are the same. but:..&gt;&gt;&gt; l[0]=7.&gt;&gt;&gt; l.[7, 2, 3, 4].&gt;&gt;&gt; l[0:1][0]=13.&gt;&gt;&gt; l.[7, 2, 3, 4]...so the slice's 0-element is the same as the list's 0-element, but when i change it in the slice, it is not changed in the list. why not?"
