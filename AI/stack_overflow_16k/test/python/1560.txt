"re-order dataframe based on month (not alphabet) for a dataframe, let's call it weather1:..        temp.month   .apr     61.jan     32.jul     69.oct     43...i would like to sort month based on the actual calendar month order, and not alphabetically. ..i can do the following:..ordered= ['jan','apr','jul','oct'].df.reindex(ordered)...however i am looking for a more dynamic way to do this, perhaps using ""date part"" functions...thank you in advance."
