"why is the output of a defined function in the class not an integer but a ""bound method""? i'm trying to set up a class named currency in which the input can be your money in euros and the output will be the same amount but in cents. however, my output isn't an amount but only the function itself with the ""error"" &lt;bound method currency.ore of &lt;currency.currency object at 0x108fde3c8&gt;&gt;. what do i need to change?..class currency:.    ""a general currency class""..    def __init__(self, euro=0, cent=0):.        ""input euros and cents, with default values 0"".        self.amount_euro = euro.        self.amount_cent = cent..    def cent(self):.        cent = (self.amount_euro * 100) + self.amount_cent.        return cent...from currency import currency..ans = currency(1).cent.print(ans)"
