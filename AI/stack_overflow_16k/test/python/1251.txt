"confused with single element tuple here below the codes i tried to locate the relative maxima and minima of stock prices and make a plot with matplotlib..stockewma=pd.ewma(stock,span=3).stocka=np.array(stockewma.values).mx=argrelextrema(stocka,np.greater).mn=argrelextrema(stocka,np.less).mxx=[stock.index[i] for i in mx].mxy=[stock.ix[i] for i in mx].mnx=[stock.index[i] for i in mn].mny=[stock.ix[i] for i in mn]...the code works alright, but then i found out the argrelextrema actually returns a tuple of single np.array of a single list...why should it wrap the data as clumsy as that?..for that i have to access the index value with mx[0] #cuz it is a single element tuple...and i don't understand why the following code could work, index with nesting a array of single list?!..mxx=[stock.index[i] for i in mx].mxy=[stock.ix[i] for i in mx].mnx=[stock.index[i] for i in mn].mny=[stock.ix[i] for i in mn]"
