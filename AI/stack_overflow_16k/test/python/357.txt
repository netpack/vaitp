"how to find a certain ""term"" thing in a file using blank i am going to make something for my local network friends to use, and adding in a login feature to make it where others couldn't steal there username. in a separate txt file, i store the login information. and i need help on pulling the information for the user and comparing them...""username:password"".""username2:password2"".""username3:password3"".""username4:password4""...so they enter ""username"" and it compares what they entered for password to ""password"", or if they enter username2 it will compare there response to password2. .i am guessing it will need to read the file and user s.split("":"")[0] and s.split("":"")[1].i do not know how to pull the information and compare. please help, .thanks.richard"
