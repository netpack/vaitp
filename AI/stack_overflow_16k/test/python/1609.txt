"how can i write each line of a file into a new file in random order? i am new to blank and have been struggling with this problem for a while. i would like to write a function which takes a set of bmp file names from a file called filenames.txt and prints them out in random order in a newly generated file called config_1.cfg. ..the file names in the filenames.txt file look like this:..e1i11d0.bmp.e1i13d0.bmp.e1i15d0.bmp.e1i17d0.bmp.e1i19d0.bmp.e1i1d0.bmp.e1i21d0.bmp...i would like them to be written out in a new config_1.cfg file, which should look something like this:..#filename: config_1.cfg.#subject: 1..-present 1.[back] ""e1i11d0.bmp"".[connect] 0 1..-calibration 1.[connect] 0 2..-present 2.[back] ""e1i1d0.bmp"".[connect] 0 3..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 4..-present 3.[back] ""e1i19d0.bmp"".[connect] 0 5...all the bmp file names in the .txt file need to be written out in random order. so far, i have tried generating the .cfg file like this:..import os.import random..curdir = os.getcwd().os.chdir('/users/username/folder')..index = 1.count = 1..# create output .cfg file..outfile = open('config_1' + '.cfg', 'w')..outfile.write('# filename: config_1' + 'n');.outfile.write('#subject: 1' + 'n');..#get the bmp file names from the .txt file..with open('filenames.txt', 'r') as fin:.    fileid = list(fin)..random.shuffle(fileid)..for line in fileid:..    outfile.write('-present ' + str(index) + 'n').    outfile.write('[back] ' + str(fileid) + '.bmp' + 'rn').    outfile.write('[connect] 0 ' + str(index + 1) + 'rnrn').    index += 1..# add shuttercalibration after each instance of bmp file name being printed..caliblock = 1..for line in fileid:.    outfile.write('-calibration ' + str(index) + 'rn').    outfile.write('[connect] 0 ' + str(index + 1) + 'rnrn').    index += 1...except, when i run the code, i what i get in my .cfg is this:..# filename: config_1.#subject: 1.-present 1.[back] ['e1_i1_3d0.bmprn', 'e1_i1_5d0.bmprn', 'e1_i1_d0.bmprn',     'e1_i1_9d0.bmprn', 'e1_i1_7d0.bmprn', 'e1_i2_1d0.bmprn',     'e1_i1_1d0.bmprn'].bmp.[connect] 0 2..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 3..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 3..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 3..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 3..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 3..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 3..-calibration 2.[connect] 0 3..-present 2.[back] ['e1_i1_3d0.bmprn', 'e1_i1_5d0.bmprn', 'e1_i1_d0.bmprn',     'e1_i1_9d0.bmprn', 'e1_i1_7d0.bmprn', 'e1_i2_1d0.bmprn',     'e1_i1_1d0.bmprn'].bmp.[connect] 0 3...rather than each file name appearing once and being followed by a calibration, i get all of them printed at once and multiple calibrations under each. ..i would really appreciate any help with this. thank you!"
