"how do i call a function? i am trying to make a program that solves math equations. i want it to ask what type of question would you like to solve, then based on the answer, it then directs you to a function that i created. the function will ask you the values of some variables, and it will then solve the question...what_do_you_need = raw_input(""which equation would you like to use?"")..if what_do_you_need ==  ""find_y_value"":.    slope = int(raw_input(""enter the slope"")).    x = int(raw_input(""enter the x coordinate"")).    y_int = int(raw_input(""enter the y intercept"")).    import find_y_value..def find_y_value(slope, x, y_int):.    y = (slope * x) + y_int.    print(y)..def find_y_int(y, slope, x):.    y_int = (slope * x) - y.    print(y_int)..def find_x_value(y, slope, y_int):.    x_value = (y-y_int)/slope.    print(x_value)..def slope_from_slope_int(y, x, y_int):.    slope = (y-y_int)/x.    print(slope)..def slope_from_coordinates(x1, x2, y1, y2):.    slope1 = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).    print(slope1)"
