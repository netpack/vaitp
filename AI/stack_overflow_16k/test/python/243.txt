"typeerror: coercing to unicode: need string or buffer, list found: how to create a loop i'm working on a blank script that will add a folder and all of its contents to a zip file using both zipfile and os...z = zipfile(""mynewfile.zip"", ""w"").z.write(os.walk(directory)).z.printdir().z.close()...unfortunatly i've found that this is considered a list when using os.walk, which causes the error:..typeerror: coercing to unicode: need string or buffer, list found: how to create a loop...looking around at this error, i think i need a loop to cycle through each item in the list. my problem is that i can't figure out how to translate previous answers for my specific needs. .e.g typeerror: coercing to unicode: need string or buffer, list found..i have also tried ..for root dirs files in os.walk(directory).    z.write(files)...which also causes the same error to occur...however using..for root dirs files in os.walk(directory).    z.write(root)...displays all the folders within the directory, but no files. i'm not sure why this does not count as a list...i assume i need to somehow combine these 2 ideas, any help doing so would be greatly appeciated."
