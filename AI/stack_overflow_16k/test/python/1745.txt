"blank: format string with float, right alignment i want to align a combination of str and float to the right side. in my example, ""tax = $"" is a string and tax is a float. i have two ways to accomplish this...print((""tax = $%.2f"" % tax).rjust(70)).print(""%66s%.2f"" % (""tax = $"",tax))...the output is the following:..                                                       tax = $0.42...both of them are working. but i don't think they are good enough. the codes are kind of burdensome. at the beginning, i wrote something like..print(""tax = $%.2f"" % tax)...i tried to put a right align flag in this line, but i don't know where should i put it in...is there a neat way to do this?..thank you,"
