"is there a way decrypt a sentence wrote with numbers that have letter values in a dictionary? i need to ""translate"" a sentence wrote with numbers (such as ""112233""), using a dictionary which assigns 2 numbers to a letter ..so this is the dictionary: ..code_2 = {14: 'a', 15: 'b', 16: 'c', 24: 'd', 25: 'e', 26: 'f', 34: 'g', 35: .'h', 36: 'i', 44: 'j', 45: 'k', 46: 'l',. 54: 'm', 55: 'n', 56: 'Ã±', 64: 'o', 65: 'p', 66: 'q', 74: 'r', 75: 's',. 76: 't', 84: 'u', 85: 'v', 86: 'w', 94: 'x', 95: 'y', 96: 'z'}...i've tried to separate a given sentence (like 141516) every 2 numbers, so it returns this: 14 15 16.my goal would be to be able to translate a code written in numbers to a sentence with letter, for example if someone writes ""3525464664"" i would like the program to return it's translation using the dictionary above ( ""hello"") ..this is the function i've found..def codification(words,code_2):..    result=''..    for letter in words:..        if letter in code_2:..            result= result+str(code_2[letter])..        else:..            result= result+letter..    return result...sentence= input('write:')...print (str(codification(sentence,code_2)))...i've also found a way to separate a series of numbers into groups of 2 numbers with the following code:..def encrypt(code, lenght):...    return ' '.join(code[i:i+lenght] for i in range(0,len(code),lenght))....code= input()....print(encrypt(str(code),2))...i've no idea on how to solve this problem so if anyone can help me i would be very grateful..[edit]: is there a way in which i could translate 2 or more words? for example, ""3525464664 267436255524"" (""hello friend""). because in with the code given below if i try to do this i get an error message."
