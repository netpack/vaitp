"covert strings inside for loop into a list i'm trying to create a list containing all the strings found inside double quotes, so far i've got to this...matches = ['8 ""app/http/controllers/controller.php"" line 1', '9 ""app/http/controllers/postcontroller.php"" line 1']..if len(matches) &gt; 1:.    for match in matches:.        matches = re.findall(r'""(.+?)""', match).        print(matches[0])...it outputs this..app/http/controllers/controller.php.app/http/controllers/postcontroller.php...i want to turn those strings into a list so it looks like this..['app/http/controllers/controller.php','app/http/controllers/postcontroller.php']...it should also be dynamic as there can be more than 2 strings inside double quotes...how can this be done?"
