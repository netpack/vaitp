"why is this invalid syntax within for loop? i was trying with the below code and got the error:..def preprocess(s):.    return (word: true for word in s.lower().split()).s1 = 'this is a book'.text = preprocess(s1)...and then here comes the error that ..return (word: true for word in s.lower().split()) ...is invalid syntax. i cannot find where the error comes from...i want to put the sequence into this list model: ..[""this"": true, ""is"" : true, ""a"" :true, ""book"": true]"
