"finding closest value in a binary file i have a large binary file (~4 gb) containing a series of image and time stamp data. i want to find the image that most closely corresponds to a user-given time stamp. there are millions of time stamps in the file, though. in blank 2.7, using seek, read, struct.unpack, it took over 900 seconds just to read all the time stamps into an array. is there an efficient algorithm for finding the closest value that doesn't require reading all of the values? they monotonically increase, though at very irregular intervals."
