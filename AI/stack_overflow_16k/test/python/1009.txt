"what's the most efficient way to decide if the elements in a short list appear in the same sequence in a long list in blank? suppose all the elements of the short list are in the long list, and all elements are unique..e.g.:  ..long = [1,2,3,4,5]  .short = [1,3,5]  .# same_sequence(long, short) = true  .short = [1,4,3]  .# same_sequence(long, short) = false...the one i have in mind is the following, but i'm not sure if it's the best way (corrected thank @abarnert)..def same_sequence(long, short):.    i = -1.    for e in short:.        j = long.index(e, i + 1).        if j &lt; i:.            return false.        else:.            i = j.    return true"
