"setting a condition for a mixed list maybe there was a better way to do this, but i have a list of mixed elements:..outlist = [10, [etsc, juniper hairstreak], [etsc, spotted turtle],.           [etsc, blanding's turtle], iwwh]...what i would like to do is iterate over this list and if the list element contains etsc, then i want to convert it to a string like this:..etsc (juniper hairstreak)...if it doesn't contain etsc then i just want to convert it to a string:..iwwh...ultimately the strings will populate a variable in an access database table.  but i have no idea how to tell blank to find the list elements containing etsc, since some of the elements are lists within a list and some are just strings.  ..any help is greatly appreciated!!"
