"plot a table of a scatterplot with 2 large arrays in blank i have two large arrays, one of actual measured values (actual) and one of computer model output values (model). the arrays are of different sizes (~11,000 for the model, ~700 for the actual). when using the code below on the two arrays, the column titles appear in the top row but all the values within the array are in the next row instead of separated. i have also tried saving the arrays into a csv but the model values do not contain commas and thus cannot be read correctly. also when viewing the arrays, they are not in the desired order such that the model array and the actual array are not correlated yet the scatter plot arranges the arrays accordingly...overall, i can plot the 2 datasets but the order is the issue. i need to find out how to include lat/lon into these masked arrays. a straight-up table of what is plotted in a scatterplot would be ideal. (scatterplot code followed by table code is below)..import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5,5), dpi=72).plt.scatter(model,actual, s=50, cmap=cmap)...plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],'r') #1-1 fit line.plt.grid(true).plt.xlim((0,10)).plt.ylim((0,10)).plt.xlabel('modeled').plt.ylabel('actual').plt.table(true) #gives error ""table() takes exactly 0 arguments (1 given)""...the scatterplot image in this link. 1"
