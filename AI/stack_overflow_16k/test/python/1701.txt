"how do i make class variables/methods created and used only when needed? i'm working on a model that uses player data. during development, only certain data is needed. my thought was to create a playerdata class but my amateur mind doesn't understand/know how to do this properly...i understand this code is basic, but it's just for example.....class playerdata(object):.    def __init__(self, player_id):.        self.player_id = player_id..    def past_games(self):.        # only if requested, query db for data..    def vital_info(self):.        # only if requested, query db for data..    def abilities(self):.        # only if requested, query db for data..pd = playerdata(235)...if i call pd.vital_info for the first time, i only want to execute the query at that point. how do i structure this so the requested query is run while the other queries are not (unless needed later on)?"
