"blank if statement condition using dictionary string i would like to use dictionary value of the key to verify if condition is true e.g..dictionary = [{'class': '&gt;50k'},{'class': '&lt;=50k'}].    for i in dictionary:..        if i['class'] == '&lt;=50k':.            po_list_count +=1..        else:.            rich_list_count +=1..    print(po_list_count,'---',rich_list_count)...print should be 1 --- 1 instead i get 0 --- 2.i have tried with if i['class'] in ['&lt;=50k']  but same result..is it something i do not understand about how if statement works or perhaps how it treats strings?"
