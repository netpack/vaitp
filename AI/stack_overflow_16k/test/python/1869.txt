"capitalization of sentences in blank i'm tinkering around with a simple code but i can't seem to get it down...i want the user to enter a string in the prompt in the form of a sentence. for example: ..hey. how are you? the c.i.a. is watching! lol. ...and it returns:..hey. how are you? the c.i.a. is watching! lol....so it's requirements are:...capitalize the first of the string if it is a letter.capitalize after every period, question mark or exclamation mark.capitalize the letter if there is a period after it and no letters before it...so far i only have ..def fix_capitalization():.s = raw_input(""enter string: "").if s[0:1] == 'a' &lt; [char] &lt; 'z': .    capitalize(s)...the thought process on how i would do this is as follows ..capitalize(s) to capitalize the first letter, then go through the string and if there is a period, question mark or exclamation mark then the next letter will be capitalized. if there is a letter before the period and two characters before a period then capitalize the letter before the period."
