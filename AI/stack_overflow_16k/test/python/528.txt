"how to exclude nonetype class while reading string in blank i have a list that is pulled into blank from google sheets..some of the cells are empty and return a value of none...i checked the class type for these 'none' values and it says class = 'nonetype'..what is the best way to exclude these cells, without loosing the the ""i coordinate"" of the cells that do contain the string values i'm interested in?..this is what i tried, but i'm getting a syntax error:..for i, val in enumerate(some_list):.    if ( i != isinstance(nonetype)).        print (i,val)"
