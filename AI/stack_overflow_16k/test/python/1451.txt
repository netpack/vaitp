"find a string in a dictionary of list and dictionaries i have a variable dictionary of list and dictionaries that i am trying to iterate over to find a particular value..the dictionary looks something like this..list = { 'foo' : [1,2,3,4], 'bar' : { 'something' : 'value', 'something else' : 'value' }, 'anotherlist' : [5,6,7,8]}...the exact structure of this is variable, can be either a list, dictionary, nested, or both.  i have no way of knowing ahead of time what it will be. ..i know i will need a generator, but i am failing.  here is a snipped of code i tried (not my own)..def find(key, dictionary):.    print dictionary.    if key in dictionary:.        yield key.    for k, v in dictionary.iteritems():.        if k == key:.            yield v.        elif isinstance(v, dict):.            for result in find(key, v):.                yield result.        elif isinstance(v, list):.            for d in v:.                for result in find(key, d):.                    yield result...(i know this is returning key, but i figured i could modify it to value)..but i am getting following:...attributeerror: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'iteritems'....i tried to modify it ..def find(key, dictionary):.    print dictionary.    if key in dictionary:.        yield key.    if isinstance(dictionary, unicode):.        yield key.    for k, v in dictionary.iteritems():.        if k == key:.            yield v.        elif isinstance(v, dict):.            for result in find(key, v):.                yield result.        elif isinstance(v, list):.            for d in v:.                for result in find(key, d):.                    yield result...but that didn't help...any suggestions?"
