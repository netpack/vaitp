"how do i remove the degree symbol (°) from an integer i am making a program with blank to go get weather data (forecast and daily) and store it in an excel sheet. the program is also getting the ° sign, excel keeps denying it and causing errors. i'm using this dailytemp.remove('un{degree sign}') to remove the degree sign but it's looking for '°' instead of the symbol itself...i was wondering how to either pull the tic marks out or search for the symbol by itself."
