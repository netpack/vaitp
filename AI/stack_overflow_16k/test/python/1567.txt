"blank how to find an object by its attributes? is there a way to get an object by matching it up with its attributes? .for example:..class band:.    def __init__(self, name, number):.    self.name = name.    self.number = number...rivers = band(""rivers"", 1).patrick = band(""pat"" , 2).brian = band(""brian"" , 3).scott = band(""scott"", 4)...in this code, is there a way for me to use a number(lets say 1), to find the object rivers within the band class and get its name attribute?..thank you for taking your time to read this and have a nice day."
