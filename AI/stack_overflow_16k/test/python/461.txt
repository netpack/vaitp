"text comparison - find any common group of n words without knowing the words beforehand suppose i have two text files, test and master, each of varying length. i want to parse through test to see if it has any n consecutive words in common with master...for example, if n = 5, return a list that has as its elements five word phrases that are common between test and master. for example, one of the elements would be and then we went to, if this grouping of five words existed in both files...i have no idea if libraries exist for this, they probably do, but i'm unaware of them. as far my own solution, one popped into my head where i might split both files on whitespace and iterate through them to see if elements 0 through 4 match, then 1 through 5, 2 through 6, etc. seems very inefficient, especially with larger files...any advice is appreciated, and if i can expand further on the question, please let me know. thanks!"
