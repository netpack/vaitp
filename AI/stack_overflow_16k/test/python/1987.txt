"how to store an object between script runs? i'm using a blank script based on this mint api to pull personal finance info every hour...to connect to mint i do mint = mintapi.mint(email, password) which opens a chrom instance via selenium and logs into mint, and creates an object of &lt;class 'mintapi.api.mint'&gt;..to refresh info i just need to do mint.initiate_account_refresh()...but every time i run the script, it does the whole logging in thing again...can i store the mint object on disk somehow so i can skip that step and just do the account refresh?"
