"how to get file extension correctly? i know that this question is asked many times on this website. but i found that they missed an important point: only file extension with one period was taken into consider like *.png *.mp3, but how do i deal with these filename with two period like .tar.gz...the basic code is:..filename = '/home/lancaster/downloads/a.ppt'.extention = filename.split('/')[-1]...but obviously, this code do not work with the file like a.tar.gz..how to deal with it? thanks."
