"blank library to automatically detect unknown similar strings i have a very big file with millions of paths to various executables on windows systems. a simple example would be the following:...c:windowsccmcache1ddeploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache7deploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache2odeploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache6deploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache15deploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcachemdeploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache1gdeploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache2rdeploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache1ldeploy-application.exe.c:windowsccmcache2sdeploy-application.exe...or...c:usersuser23452345temptest1another1-application.exe.c:usersuser1324asdftempanother-applicatiooon.exe.c:usersuser23452---5templilianother-application.exe.c:usersuser23hkjhf_5tempan0ther-application.exe...as a human, i can recognize that these strings are similar and match them fairly easily with some regex in code. my issue however is to find these patterns in the first place as there are far too many of those, completely unknown to me and are changing frequently...my goal is to write a blank script that finds these similar strings with a degree of certainty and groups them for me. ..which methods, libraries, keywords etc. should i look into to solve this problem?"
