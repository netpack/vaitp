"how to change the color channels of an image in blank? this is a question that probably should be floating around somewhere here, but i don't seem to find it...i have this code:..import matplotlib.image as img     ..img1 = img.imread('./images_32x32/test_1.png').print(""shape = "", img1.shape) # output: 32x32x3..img2 = img.imread('./images_32x32/test_2.png').print(""shape = "", img2.shape) # output: 32x32x4...my problem is in the shape of img2 (img2.shape) i would like it to be also 3...how do i change this?"
