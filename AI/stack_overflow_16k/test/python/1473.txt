"finding the number of substrings which sum is equal to m i'm trying some blank and i got this:..i have a string s='3,0,4,0,3,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,5,0,4,2' and m=9..i want to know how many substrings with with sum equals m there are...so with s and m above i whould get 7 as a result as:.'3,0,4,0,3,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,5,0,4,2'. _'0,4,0,3,1,0,1,0'_____________. _'0,4,0,3,1,0,1'_______________. ___'4,0,3,1,0,1,0'_____________.____'4,0,3,1,0,1'_______________.____________________'0,0,5,0,4'_.______________________'0,5,0,4'_. _______________________'5,0,4'_...now, the code i came up with does something like that..def es1(s,m):.    c = 0.    m = 0.    ls = stringtoint(s).    for x in ls:.        i= ls.index(x).        for y in ls[i+1:]:.            m = x + y.            if m == m:.                c += 1.                m = 0.                break.            if m &gt; m:.                m = 0.                break.            else:.                continue.    return c..def stringtoint(ls):.    s = [int(x) for x in ls.split(',')].    return s...where stringtoint obv gives me a list of int to work with..the thing i don't get is where my concept is wrong since es1 returns 3"
