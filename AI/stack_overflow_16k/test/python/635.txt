"linking two pieces of code in blank i'm currently trying to write a code that watches a specific file in a certain directory, and then when the file is updated my program tells me it has updated and then reads from this updated file and outputs a personalised response. ..to watch the file, i use watchdog and that works fine by itself. to read from the file, i have written a really simple code to get it to read the number in the text file, then use if-elif-else statements to get the desired output. however, i struggle with linking the 2 pieces of code together i.e. i would like the wathdog script to watch the file, then when it updates trigger the next part of the code that reads the file watchdog was looking at and give the desired output...i'm really stuck, would anyone be able to help me out?..edit:..import time.from watchdog.observers import observer.from watchdog.event import filesystemeventhandler..class myhandler(filesystemeventhandler):.      def on_modified(self, event):.      print(""got it!"")..if __name__== ""__main__"":.     event_handler = myhandler().     observer = observer().     observer.schedule(event_handler, path = 'my path here', recursive=false)..try:.   while true:.             time.sleep(1).except keyboardinterrupt:.   observer.stop().observer.join()...that's my watchdog code that watches the file for when it is updated. ..f=open(""myfile.txt"", encoding='utf-8-sig').g=f.read().print(g).num=int(g).if num = 10:.     r = open(""response.txt"", ""w"").     r.write(""bla"").     r.close().elif num = 20.     r = open(""response.txt"", ""w"").     r.write(""bla"").     r.close()...and so on with all the other options. this second part is the part that writes a new text file based on what is written on the file that is being watched. ..what i would like to do is have watchdog (first part of the code) watch a file, then when it is updated, trigger the second part of the code to read from that file and give the designated output (second part of the code) i just can't figure out how to link the two! i though putting the second part of the code in the 'if' section of the first code, but it didn't work."
