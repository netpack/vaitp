"who uses sys.modules['__builtin__'] in any case to store data? i was working on some blank code (written around 2011) and realized the following line that keeps a global var as follows:..setattr(sys.modules['__builtin__'], 'globalvartest', 123)...and then accessing it later..getattr(sys.modules['__builtin__'], 'globalvartest')...i just was wondering, why not use a class with a class member variable to hold data that needs to exist globally.  or is this something where i am completely ignorant and don't see the magic behind it?"
