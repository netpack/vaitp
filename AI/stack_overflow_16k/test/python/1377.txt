"what do the binary operators mean when applied to logicals? my understanding is that &amp; is the bitwise and operator. so i would expect it to have no meaning when applied to logicals. however, i see that:..&gt;&gt;&gt; false &amp; false.false.&gt;&gt;&gt; false &amp; true.false.&gt;&gt;&gt; true &amp; true.true...and so on. likewise for the other bitwise operators...so, why do these operators even accept logical operands? and where can i find the documentation that explains this? i searched for it but could not find an explanation."
