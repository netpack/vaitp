"blank: copying a list and removing an element at the same time i am new to blank and am trying to create a copy of a list without a certain element. this is how i am doing it at the moment:..oldlist[1,23,4,3,5,345,4].newlist = oldlist[:].del newlist[3].dosomthingtolist(newlist)...i was wondering if there is a better more eloquent way to do this, instead of copying the list and then deleting the element in two lines?"
