"paramiko sshclient sudo to new user need to sudo su - diffuser after connection via sshclient function...i cannot login with ssh directly to the required user id in order to run commands owned by that required user.  when at the local cli of the target ssh system, i simply run sudo su - diffuser, and then run the required commands...is there anyway to simulate this using the paramiko sshclient commands?"
