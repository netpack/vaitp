"preferred way to import multiple modules from package what is the best way to import when you need several modules from a package?..from pyside.qtgui import qgraphicsview, qaction, qkeysequence, qmenu, qcursor, qkeyevent..view = qgraphicsview().......or..import pyside.qtgui..view = qtgui.qgraphicsview().......or even..import pyside..view = pyside.qtgui.qgraphicsview().......i understand that in most cases the second way has the best tradeoff between ambiguity and length in the code. but are there any other considerations like performance when importing larger packages?"
