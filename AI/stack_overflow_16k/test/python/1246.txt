"want to compare value at one geographic location to another location i have a dataframe with columns for latitude, longitude, hwmqualityname, elevation, description, and other non-essential information. shown below is the dataframe for only latitude, longitude, hwmqualityname, elevation, and description. there are additional columns with values in the dataframe before the latitude column, after the description column, and in between the latitude, longitude, hwmqualityname, elev_ft, and hwm_locationdescription columns:..import numpy as np.import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.import netcdf4 as nc4.import os.import sys.from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot.init_notebook_mode(connected=true).import plotly.offline as po.import plotly.graph_objs as go.from mpl_toolkits.basemap import basemap.import pathlib as pl.import matplotlib as mpl.import pandas as pd.import sys;sys.path.append('../ncsurge').from importlib import reload.import geopandas as gpd.from shapely.geometry import point, multipoint.from shapely.ops import nearest_points.from hwm import *..root_hwm = pl.path(r'p:tempbpozoscriptshwm').a = pd.read_csv(str(root_hwm / 'filteredhwms.csv')).hwm_m = gpd.geodataframe(a).hwm_m..latitude       longitude        hwmqualityname           elev_ft     hwm_locationdescription.35.281050926   -76.6625853795   'excellent: +/- 0.05 ft'  7.288     'side of left garage'.34.676933      -77.080633       'poor: +/- 0.40 ft'      12.241     'outside marked with pen'.....34.94107586    -76.6507665736   'good: +/- 0.10 ft'       6.025     'side of post'...there a certain number of these points (say 100) that are located along the coastline and are relatively near each other when seen on a map. what i want to do are a couple things:..1) i want to compare the elev_ft value at each location to the elev_ft values in  surrounding locations given a radius of say 300 ft to determine if the elev_ft value at the location i am looking at is an outlier...2) after identifying the locations that have an elev_ft value that is an outlier, i want to use the strings in the hwmqualityname column and the hwm_locationdescription column to remove all points (i.e. remove the entire row from the dataframe) that contain the word ""poor"" in the hwmqualityname column or that contain the word ""waves"" or any additional words related to waves in the hwm_locationdescription column...what i hope to have in the end is a dataframe that has removed points based on the conditions described above...i am new to blank and i don't know the best way to tackle this task...any and all help would be appreciated."
