"making a dictionary of overlaps from a dictionary this problem is teasing me:..i have 6 different sequences that each overlap, they are name 1-6..i have made a function that represents the sequences in a dictionary, and a function that gives me the part of the sequences that overlap...now i should use those 2 functions to construct a dictionary that take the number of overlapping positions in both the right-to-left order and in the left-to-right oder...the dictionary i have made look like:..{'1': 'ggctccccacggggtacccataacttgacagtagatctcgtccagacccctagc',. '2': 'ctttacccggaagagcgggacgctgccctgcgcgattccaggctccccacggg',. '3': 'gtcttcagtagaaaattgtttttttcttccaagaggtcggagtcgtgaacacatcagt',. '4': 'tgcgagggaagtgaagtatttgaccctttacccggaagagcg',. '5': 'cgattccaggctccccacggggtacccataacttgacagtagatctc',. '6': 'tgacagtagatctcgtccagacccctagctggtacgtcttcagtagaaaattgtttttttcttccaagaggtcggagt'}...i should end up with a result like:..{'1': {'3': 0, '2': 1, '5': 1, '4': 0, '6': 29},.'3': {'1': 0, '2': 0, '5': 0, '4': 1, '6': 1},.'2': {'1': 13, '3': 1, '5': 21, '4': 0, '6': 0},.'5': {'1': 39, '3': 0, '2': 1, '4': 0, '6': 14},.'4': {'1': 1, '3': 1, '2': 17, '5': 2, '6': 0},.'6': {'1': 0, '3': 43, '2': 0, '5': 0, '4': 1}}...i seems impossible..i guess it's not, so if somebody could (not do it) but push me in the right direction, it would be great."
