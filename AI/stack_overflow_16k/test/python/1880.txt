"finding latest file in a folder using blank i've searched for an answer for this but the answers still gave me an error message and i wasn't allowed to ask there because i had to make a new question. so here it goes.....i need my blank script to use the latest file in a folder...i tried several things, currently the piece of code looks like this:..list_of_files = glob.glob('/my/path/*.csv').latest_file = max(list_of_files, key=os.path.getmtime)...but the code fails with the following comment:..valueerror: max() arg is an empty sequence..does anyone have an idea why?"
