"class method don't update attribute i have this code:..class test:.    def __init__(self, a):.        self.a = a.        self.success = true.    def method(self):.        self.success = false..test = test(""tree"").test.method.print(test.success)   ..#output is: true...i need to check if the operation programmed in ""method"" is successful. so, on success, i update the ""success"" attribute declared in the constructor. but when i call the method after creating the class object, the attribute is not updated."
