"how to create a desktop shortcut from a compressed file recently i have been approached by friends and family asking me to create various blank apps for them. i'm trying to find an easy way to distribute these projects in a way that requires zero prior knowledge and minimal explanation. ..my idea is to create a virtual environment for each app and compress it, then i can simply email it to them, they can unzip it and be good to go. my question is how can i have this create shortcuts on their desktops to things such as the batch file (most importantly), excel sheets, image folders, etc?..i would appreciate any help on this, or if i'm going about this completely wrong, it would be great to learn of a better way."
