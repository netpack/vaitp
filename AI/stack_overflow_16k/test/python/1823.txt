"how to remove whole words from a string in blank? i'm trying to make a function to remove whole words from a string in blank, and i think i have something that does it:..def remove_words_from_str(strn, word, replacement=' '): .    return re.sub(r'(s*)'+word+'(s*)', replacement, strn)...the problem is this takes pieces of words too, which i don't want...ex:  print( remove_words_from_str( ""is this is a test ? yes this is ; this is"", ""is"" ) ).out:  th  a test ? yes th  ; th  ...is there a way to only take whole words? (in other words, i don't want 'this' to go to 'th', cause the 'is' in 'this' is not a full word)"
