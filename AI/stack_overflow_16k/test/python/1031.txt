"difference of comma and semicolon when assign values in one line in blank i am writing if statement in blank and i need to assign multiple values...in order to style it, i want all my assignment in one line. so i tried comma to separate them...if true:.    a=0.5, b=0.5.    print(a), print(b)...this would have a syntax error:..syntaxerror: can't assign to literal..however, when i use semicolon it works...if true:.    a=0.5; b=0.5.    print(a), print(b)...why can comma work in print but not in assignment?"
