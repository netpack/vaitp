"permission error. what's wrong? i'm trying to write a guess-the-number game but i keep getting random errors and can't seem to find what i'm doing wrong. here's the script:..import random.import sys.import os..def guess_number():.    file = open('highscores.txt', 'r+')#opens file.    highscore = file.read().    highscore = int(highscore).    name = input('enter your name: ')..    answer = random.randint(1,100).    print('hi ' + name + '! i'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100!').    guesses = 0.    while guesses &lt; 100:.        print('take a guess! ').        guess = input().        guess = int(guess)..        if guess &lt; answer:.            print('your guess was too low!') .            guesses = guesses + 1.        if guess &gt; answer:.            print('your guess was too high!').            guesses = guesses + 1.        if guess == answer:.            guesses = guesses + 1.            break..    if guess == answer:.        answer = str(answer).        guesses = str(guesses)....        print('good job ' + name + '! you guessed ' + answer + ' in ' +     guesses + ' guesses!').        guesses = int(guesses).    if highscore &gt; guesses:.        file.close().        os.remove('highscores.txt').        file = open('highscores.txt', ""w"").        print('congratulations! you beat the highscore!').        guesses = str(guesses).        file.write(guesses).        file.close().        guesses = int(guesses).    elif highscore &lt; guesses:.        highscore = str(highscore).        print('the highscore is:  ' + highscore)...by the way, i have a separate file named highscores.txt; when the program first runs i type ""100"" in the file and save it...here's the traceback of the error i get:..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""&lt;pyshell#8&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;.    guess_number().  file ""c:usersrhino_000desktopguessesguesses.py"", line 39, in guess_number.    os.remove('highscores.txt').permissionerror: [winerror 32] the process cannot access the file because it     is being used by another process: 'highscores.txt'"
