"how to override built-in getattr in blank? i know how to override an object's getattr() to handle calls to undefined object functions. however, i would like to achieve the same behavior for the builtin getattr() function. for instance, consider code like this:..   call_some_undefined_function()...normally, that simply produces an error:..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;.nameerror: name 'call_some_undefined_function' is not defined...i want to override getattr() so that i can intercept the call to ""call_some_undefined_function()"" and figure out what to do...is this possible?"
