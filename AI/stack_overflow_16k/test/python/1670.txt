"if statement 'not working' despite conditions being true currently going through a bin file full of hex data to process, however currently a match i'm using to try and find a group of 3 hex bytes in the file aren't working correctly. the values are identical however it is not printing my string i've currently got set to confirm that its a match, at present i'm trying to just match the first 3 bytes so we know it works etc. the code is as follows: ..match1 = ""\x00\n\x00"".print (""match1 =""+match1)..if bytedata == match1:.    print (""byte string 030791 found!"").elif bytedata == match1:.    print (""byte string 050791 found!"").exit()...the value of bytedata is currently 'x00nx00' however the script ignores this and just moves to the exit statement. the file is being opened as follows :..file = open('file.bin', 'rb').while true:.byte = file.read(3)...when printing the value of byte it reports as ""x00nx00"" does anyone have any ideas as to why the match isn't working properly?"
