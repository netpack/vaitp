"infinite while loop in blank, but only when 1 is the target value so, i've just started learning blank and thought a simple collatz conjecture program would be a fun project to start with. the idea is to print every step, followed by a total number of steps taken...problem is that i can't prevent this code from going into an infinite loop, but only if i use 'while x!=1'. i can replace with 'while x!=2' and then it stops at 2 as expected. i'm struggling to understand what's so special about the number 1 here...thanks in advance. here's the code so far:..x=int(input(""enter a number: "")).steps=int(0)..while x!=1:..    if  x%2==0:.        x=int(x/2).        steps=(steps+1).        print(x)..    if  x%2!=0:.        x=((x*3)+1).        steps=(steps+1).        print(x)..print(""steps:"",steps)"
