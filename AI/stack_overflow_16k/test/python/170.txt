"handle differing number of returned variables i am looking for handling differing number of returned values from invoked functions in a set number of target variables. the following simplified snippet is a starting illustration:..def f1(): return 1,2,3..def f2(): return 4,5..a,b,c = f1()..a,b,c = f2()  # how to massage this call: default of some sort?...so the objective would be to unpack either 2 or 3 results into three output variables...consider that the f() being invoked may be one of (many functions..)  that mostly all return only two variables .. but there is a need to add a third parameter to maybe one or two of them...the motivation here: an existing codebase that presently returns only two variables. but i need to add a third one. it would be helpful to leave the existing code mostly alone and simply handle the missing third parameter gracefully...what construction could be used here?"
