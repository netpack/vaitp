"dechunking a string in blank i have an array of bytes in blank, which looks like this:..chunk_size = 8.a = b'12341234a12341234b12341234c12341234...'...i have to remove each nth byte (a, b, c in the example). array length can be many thousands. typical chunk size can be 128 or few thounds...this is my current solution:..chunk_size = 8.output = b"""".join([ i[:-1] for i in [ a[j:j+9] for j in range(0, len(a), chunk_size + 1) ]])...i am looking for other solutions, which could be more elegant...blank 3.x only solutions are fine."
