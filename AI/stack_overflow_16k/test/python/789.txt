"why can't i break the loop when typing done in blank? i'm trying to exit the loop with done, and not accept non-integers, what am i doing wrong?..while true:.    try:.        num = int(input(""enter a number or enter done: "")).        if (num % 2) == 0:.            print(""number is even"").        elif (num % 2) == 1:.            print(""number is odd"").        else:.            num == 'done'.            break.    except:.            print ('invalid input').print ('done')"
