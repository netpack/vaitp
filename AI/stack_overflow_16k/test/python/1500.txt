"how to execute this list comprehension code? i'm trying to understanding this code, but so far i am unable to draw any logic. i've executed it to get the output, but still, i can't figure out. here is the code:..lst = [[c for c in range(r)] for r in range(3)] .for x in lst: .    for y in x: .       if y &lt; 2: .           print('*', end='')...i'm executing it from right-to-left, i.e starting from right-side loop ""for r in range(3)"". first, r will be ""0"" which will then be assigned to left-side loop ""c for c in range(r)"". after this point, i don't know how it will execute further. ..please if somebody can explain then it would be great..thanks/"
