"is there a standard function to iterate over base classes? i would like to be able to iterate over all the base classes, both direct and indirect, of a given class, including the class itself.  this is useful in the case where you have a metaclass that examines an internal options class of all its bases...to do this, i wrote the following:..def bases(cls):.    yield cls.    for direct_base in cls.__bases__:.        for base in bases(direct_base):.            yield base...is there a standard function to do this for me?"
