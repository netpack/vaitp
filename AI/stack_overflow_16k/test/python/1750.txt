"removing an integer from a list during iteration? here is the code that i'm getting an error on. i'm getting the error: ""list index out of range"", i know that it's because you can't remove items in an iteration, but i need to and i don't know how. ..i'm essentially trying to sort this list but finding the minimum and then appending it to the new list and removing it from the old list, but i don't know how. please help...code:..list = [22,1,-5,-10,62,-11,36,8].m = list.index(min(list)).sorted_list = []..for x in range(len(list)):.    if list[x] &gt; list[m]:.        sorted_list.append(list[m]).        list.remove(list[m])...print (sorted_list)"
