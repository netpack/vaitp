"modify lists defined by other lists i am trying to make a game but cant figure out how to modify the list without affecting another one. .my code is ..list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0].list2 = list1.for i in range(len(list2)):.    list2.remove(i).print (list1).print (list2)...and the result is..[].[]...how can i make it so the two are not connected (i need to combine lists but there removed once the program restarts)"
