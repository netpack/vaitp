"i keep getting the error list assignment index out of range, why? (blank) problem:.calculate the mean and standard deviation of a tightly clustered set of 1000 initial conditions as a function of iteration number. the bunch of initial conditions should be gaussian distributed about x = 0.3 with a standard deviation of 10-3..the code i wrote:  ..from numpy import *..def iteratemap(x,r,n):.    for i in xrange(n):.        x = r * x * (1.0 - x).    return x..output = ""data"".niterations = 1000.r = 4.0.x0 = 0.3.delta = 0.00005..l = []..for i in xrange(niterations):.    x = x0.    x = iteratemap(x,r,1).    l[i] = x.    x0 = x0 + delta..a = array(l)..print 'mean: ', mean(a)...so what my code is supposed to do is to take an initial value for x (x0) and call the iteratemap function and return a new value of x and place it in a list(l) then x0 changes to a new value, and this process continues for 1000 times. i get the error ""list assignment index out of range"". also, do you think i'm following the problem correctly?"
