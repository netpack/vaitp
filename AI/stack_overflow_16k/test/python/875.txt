"numpy.reshape error changing values of string i am using numpy.reshape to convert an array but it changes the values of the items in the array...the array is something like this ..[55.4, -0.2, -1559.7, -3495.4, 237.2, 5421.7]..and after applying numpy.reshape it produces this ..[[ 5.5400e+01 -2.0000e-01 -1.5597e+03 -3.4954e+03  2.3720e+02  5.4217e+03]]..this is the code i use:..    state = [plane_x,plane_y,plane_z,last_x, last_y, last_z].    state = np.reshape(state, [1, state_sizes])...i know this probably is not doing anything to the array shape but i need to perform it in my code...all i need is that someone explain to me why this happens and actually i don't know if (55.4) is the same as (5.5400e+01) and if not i need to know how to solve this."
