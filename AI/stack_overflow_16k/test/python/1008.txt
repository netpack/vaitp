"original value of variable gets lost after initialising other variable (with it) (this tag is similar to other tags, but the other tags are often specific). i tried to raise it on a high level...i initialised a varibale ""x"", type(list) with an another varibale ""arraymetricpi"", type(list) . but as i change (""x"") i also change variable (""arraymetricpi""), which doesn't make sense to me?.maybe it's blank specific? ..what can i do, to keep an original value of a variable unchanged (here:""arraymetricpi"") - even if i change the initialised variable (here: ""x"")?..print(arraymetricpi) # returns array ""[0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03,...].x = arraymetricpi..for xx in np.arange(0, counter, 1): .# delete the first entry of the the array ""x""..print(x)  # returns array ""[0.01, 0.02, 0.03,...].print(arraymetricpi) # returns array ""[0.01, 0.02, 0.03,...]...i expected that arraymetricpi still starts with [0.0,...] as i just changed the list ""x""."
