"blank - descriptor 'split' requires a 'str' object but received a 'unicode' erm, i have ready-to-use code, and i'm sure it really works, but i get the following error:...  typeerror: descriptor 'split' requires a 'str' object but received a.  'unicode'...that's the whole def:..def assemblepacket(self, type):.    ipsplit = str.split(self.servervars[0], '.')..    packet = 'samp'.    packet += chr(int(ipsplit[0])).    packet += chr(int(ipsplit[1])).    packet += chr(int(ipsplit[2])).    packet += chr(int(ipsplit[3])).    packet += chr(self.servervars[1] &amp; 0xff).    packet += chr(self.servervars[1] &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff).    packet += type..    return packet...and here is the problem:..ipsplit = str.split(self.servervars[0], '.')...i'm sure it's not because of the code, i've tried it before (the same script) and it worked. no idea why it doesn't now.and this ""unicode"" makes me think i have to change ""str.split"", but hmmm. waiting for opinions :)"
