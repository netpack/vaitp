"blank - start function after 2 concurrent functions have completed i was wondering how in blank i can start a function that is dependant on two different functions completing that are running in their own threads?..so for example:..thread 1 is running..thread 4 is running..when thread 1 finishes, but thread 4 has not finished ..then wait..when thread 4 finishes, but thread 1 has not finished..then wait..if both thread 1 and 4 finished,..run this."
