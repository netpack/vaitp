"overwriting list keyword in blank i coded a short linked list program in blank, but without realizing list was a keyword in blank, i stored my linkedlist object into list..list = linkedlist()...running this program worked fine, but now i'm running into issues in another program where i need the list keyword to be used normally, but it still contains a reference to the linkedlist object and not the proper keyword functionality. i have since gone back to my linkedlist class and edited list to be lst instead, but i still have the same error in the class that uses the list keyword. how do i reset the list keyword to its original value?..this is the line that is giving me an error:..df = pd.dataframe(randn(6,4), index = dates, columns = list(""abcd""))...and this is the error message:...  typeerror: 'linkedlist' object is not callable"
