"generating binary objects of size n, with n being specified by the user i would like to generate a binary object that is of size n, a parameter sent into a function by a user. the contents of the binary object can be anything, the size of the object is the only thing that matters. for example says 10kb is sent in as n. i would want to create a text file or some kind of object that can be stored locally on the computer that is 10kb in size. any ideas on how i could go about doing this?"
