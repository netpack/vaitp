"check if a 5-digit number is in a list based on place value in blank, i am trying to compare a list of 10 5-digit numbers to three 5-digit number inputted by a user. .for example, if one of the numbers in the list was 46590 and the user inputted 46509 it would show that the user only got the first three numbers correct...the list is in a txt file. here's what i have coded so far:..name = input(""enter the file name: "")...number1 = str(input(""enter in your first lottery ticket: "")).number2 = str(input(""enter in your second lottery ticket: "")).number3 = str(input(""enter in your third lottery ticket: ""))..f=open(""lottery.txt"").exs=f.readlines().exs = [x for x in exs if x.strip()].mylist = [line.rstrip('n') for line in exs]..for line in mylist:.    if line == number1:.        print(""entire number equal"").    elif line[0][0] == number1[0]:.        print(""first digit equal"").    elif line[0][0] == number1[0] and line[1][0] == number1[1]:.        print(""first and second digit equal"").    elif line[0][0] == number1[0] and line[1][0] == number1[1] and line[2][0] == number1[2]:.        print(""first second and third digit equal"")...i tried using boolean expressions but i kept getting error messages. now, when i run the code above it prints out ""first digit equal"" twice. ..thanks in advance!"
