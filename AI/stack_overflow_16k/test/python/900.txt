"blank code doesn't not execute nor does give any error i have created a simple zork like game which uses text commands(more specifically in ex43 of learn blank the hard way)..i have written all the code and can break it to understand but the code does not execute. here goes my code :..from sys import exit.from random import randint..class scene(object):..    def enter(self):.        print ""this is not yet configured. subclass it and implement enter"".        exit(1)...class engine(object):..    def __init__(self, scene_map):.        self.scene_map = scene_map..    def play(self):.        current_scene = self.scene_map.opening_scene().        while true:.            print ""n-------------"".            next_scene_name = current_scene.enter().            current_scene = self.scene_map.next_scene(next_scene_name)..class death(scene):.    quips = [.
