"blank insert tab in string i just began learning blank. i'm not sure how to insert tab in string..for instance, how can i insert tab to the right of ""world"" in the strings below:..example = '    hello world'...everytime i use tab after ""world"" a drop down menu appears, how can i avoid that? thanks!.i tried using t, but then .example.lstrip() gives the result of hello worldt, instead of hello world..thanks for the answers. i used example = '    hello worldt', it works..print(example.lstrip()) gives the result: hello world    , without t"
