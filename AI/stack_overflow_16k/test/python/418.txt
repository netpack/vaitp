trying to use loops and add to a variable i want to create a while loop to prompt the user if they would like to enter a living cost.  the user would input 'y' for yes and the loop would proceed.  ..i this loop i would like to add up all the living expense entered and once the loop ends to store to the total amount in total_living.  ..example would be..l_cost = input('enter living cost? y or n ').while l_cost != 'n' (loop for living cost). totat_living = (keeps adding until i say all done. l_cost = input('enter living cost? y or n ')...other while and for loops for different scenarios.total_exp = total_living + total_credit + total_debt ect ect..i just need a little help with this as to how to add up multiple values and then maintaining the total value for the loop that i am in...if someone could point me to an example of a function or loop that is similar or tell me where to look that would be great!
