"coin change maker how would i write this?..write a complete blank program that allows a user to input a number between 0 and 99 which represents cents. the program then tell how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies would be needed to make change for this integer. for example an input of 92 would output..this is what i have written so far, i'm used to java so i think i am mixing in some java elements..a=(int(input(""amount"")..int p = 0.int n = 0.int d = 0.int q = 0..if(a % 10 != 5)   .    p = (a % 10).    a -= p..q = a / 25       .    a -= q * 25..d = a / 10       .    a -= d * 10..n = a / 5       .    a -= n * 5..print (""quarters :"" + q).print (""dimes :"" + d).print (""nickels :"" + n).print (""pennies :"" + p)"
