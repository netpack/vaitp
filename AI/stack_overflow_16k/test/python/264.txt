"how to identify substrings in the order of the string? i have a list of sentences as below...sentences = ['data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning statistics and database systems', 'data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use','data mining is the analysis step of the knowledge discovery in databases process or kdd']...i also have a set of selected concepts...selected_concepts = ['machine learning','patterns','data mining','methods','database systems','interdisciplinary subfield','knowledege discovery','databases process','information','process']...now i want to select the concepts in seleceted_concepts from sentences in the order of the sentence...i.e. my output should be as follows...output = [['data mining','process','patterns','methods','machine learning','database systems'],['data mining','interdisciplinary subfield','information'],['data mining','knowledge discovery','databases process']]...i could extract the concepts in the sentences as follows. ..output = [].for sentence in sentences:.    sentence_tokens = [].    for item in selected_concepts:.        if item in sentence:.             sentence_tokens.append(item).    output.append(sentence_tokens)...however, i have troubles of organising the extracted concepts accoridng to sentence order. is there any easy way of doing it in blank?"
