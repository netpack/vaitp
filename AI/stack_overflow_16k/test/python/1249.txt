"blank and file input functions here is the problem i'm struggling with:.two files named numbers1.txt and numbers2.txt both have an unknown number of lines, each line consisting of a single positive integer. write some code that reads a line from one file and then a line from the other file. the two integers are multiplied together and their product is added to a variable  called scalar_product which should be initialized to zero...your code should stop when it detects end of file in either file that it is reading...for example, if the sequence of integers in one file was ""9 7 5 18 13 2 22 16"" and ""4 7 8 2"" in the other file, your code would compute:..4*9 + 7*7 + 8*5 + 2*18..and thus store 161 into scalar_product...current code:..number1 = open('numbers1.txt', 'r').number2 = open('numbers2.txt', 'r').scalar_product = 0.while number1.readline() != '' and number2.readline() != '':.product = int(number1.readline()) * int(number2.readline()).scalar_product += product.number1.close.number2.close"
