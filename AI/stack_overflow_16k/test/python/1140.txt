"learning blank lists, tuples i'm learning blank and i'm trying to dive in and i want to fetch information on when files were created and modified in home directories for multiple users...so far, i'm having trouble with the syntax while i'm trying to add multiple users to the list. if there's one user, then the script works fine, however, i'd like to be able to add multiple users...import os.path.import time.import string..users = ['user1'].test = ' '.join(users)..for i in test:.    file = '/users/'+test+'/sync.log'..print(""created: %s"" % time.ctime(os.path.getctime(file))).print(""last modified: %s"" % time.ctime(os.path.getmtime(file)))...when it fails, i try to add more users e.g...users = ['user1', 'user2']...could someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?..thanks!"
