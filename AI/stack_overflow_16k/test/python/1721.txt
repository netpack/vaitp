"is there a way that can concat either a list or a string to another list? i have function that will basically add a list of string to beginning of a variable. but the variable can be either a string or a list. e.g...a = ['left', 'right']   # error if a = 'left'.b = ['unnamed' for i in range(2)].a = b + a...however, i would like to let users to make a string as well when there is only one element. so instead of ['left'], you can just input 'left'. this however, will raise error at a = b + a of course. ..is there a way that can be flexible enough to do both. or i would have to use if else to separate the two cases."
