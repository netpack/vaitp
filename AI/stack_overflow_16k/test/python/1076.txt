"user input to list, without specified amount of iterations edit - apparently this is a duplicate. and while i've no doubt the core problems are answered elsewhere i think that the level is pretty blatant and thus the ability to comprehend other solutions and transpose them into my own problem is diminished. i searched before asking. ..i'm just having a mess about and was trying to write a little thing with user input. ..however, i'm not sure how to go about this without knowing how many iterations are needed, or having two questions? ..i tried to modify it to take an if condition, which i don't really want anyway but that didn't work either : ..for i in range(50):.    userin = raw_input().    urllist.append(userin).    print 'continue? y/n'.    ynans = raw_input().    if ynans == 'n' or 'n':.        break...basically i'm just trying to take user input to fill up a list and then print it out. ..i also tried ..import sys..listone = [].num = int(raw_input('how many'))..for x in range(num):.    listone.append(raw_input(('entry #' + x+1 + ' '))...print listone...pretty basic"
