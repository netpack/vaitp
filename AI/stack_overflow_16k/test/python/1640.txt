"encode and decode a mp3 file i want so save a mp3 file as encoded string in a text file, but it doesn't work with my code..import sys, base64..f = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').b = base64.b64encode(f.read()).print sys.getsizeof(b).f.close()..try:.    file = open(sys.argv[2] + '.txt', 'w').    file.write(b).    file.close().except:.    print('something went wrong!').    sys.exit(0)..f = open(sys.argv[2] + '.txt', 'r').read().b = base64.b64decode(f).f.close()..try:.    file = open(sys.argv[2] + '2.mp3', 'w').    file.write(b).    file.close().except:.    print('something went wrong!').    sys.exit(0)...the encoded string is too short for being the full string, so there isn't a good result. so why ""doesn't"" it work?"
