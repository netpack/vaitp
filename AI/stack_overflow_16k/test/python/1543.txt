"synonyms for words in blank input during an if/else statement i'm writing a text-based game where i ask the user the turn different directions in blank. i'm wanting to set it up so synonyms/variations of the option can be used (such as ""right"", or ""right"", or ""r"", or ""r"") but don't want to have to run that in every if/else statement. i've tried making each possible option a variable:..left = ""left"" or ""left"" or ""l"" or ""l"".right = ""right"" or ""right"" or ""r"" or ""r"".forward = ""forward"" or ""forward"" ""f"" or ""f"".axe = ""axe"" or ""axe"" or ""a"" or ""a"".sword = ""sword"" or ""sword"".slingshot = ""slingshot"" or ""slingshot"".yes = ""yes"" or ""yes"" or ""y"" or ""y"".no = ""no"" or ""no"" or ""n"" or ""n""...then i tried calling it when i put in an if/else statement after an input:..def section1():..  #if the person does want to go forward.  def confirm():.    con = input(""are you absolutely sure you want to go this way? "").    if con == no:.      print(""you have gone back"").      time.sleep(0.75).      section1().    elif con == yes:.      section1b().    else:.      print(""sorry i didn't get that"").      time.sleep(0.75).      confirm()..  direction = input('what way would you like to go? right, or forward? ').  if direction == forward:.    print(""warning! this direction is well known for the great danger that make await where death is inevitable!"").    confirm().  elif direction == right:.    print(""you begin your journey down the creepy corners and dark alleys."").    time.sleep(1).    section2().  else:.    print(""that's not an option"").    section1()..    direction = input('what way would you like to go? right, or forward? ').    if direction == forward:.        print(""warning! this direction is well known for the great danger that make await where death is inevitable!"").        confirm().    elif direction == right:.        print(""you begin your journey down the creepy corners and dark alleys."").        time.sleep(1).        section2().    else:.        print(""that's not an option"").        section1()...though when i run the code and input ""right"" or ""forward"" it goes to the else statement and prints ""that's not an option"" then loops back. is there another method to me getting the synonyms (i've tried the same with making the synonyms a list), or is my syntax just not right?"
