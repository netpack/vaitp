"how to convert string into datetime? i'm quite new to blank and i'm encountering a problem...i have a dataframe where one of the columns is the departure time of flights. these hours are given in the following format : 1100.0, 525.0, 1640.0, etc...this is a pandas series which i want to transform into a datetime series such as : s = [11.00, 5.25, 16.40,...]..what i have tried already :...transforming my objects into string :...s = [str(x) for x in s]....using datetime.strptime :...s =  [datetime.strptime(x,'%h%m.%s') for x in s]...but since they are not all the same format it doesn't work...using parser from dateutil : ...s =  [parser.parse(x) for x in s]...i got the error :.. 'unknown string format'....using the panda datetime :...s= pd.to_datetime(s)...doesn't give me the expected result..thanks for your answers !"
