"blank - summing elements on list of lists based on first element of inner lists i have a list..[[0.5, 2], [0.5, 5], [2, 3], [2, 6], [2, 0.6], [7, 1]]...i require the output from summing the second element in each sublist for a unique first element. in this case it is:..[[0.5, 7], [2, 9.6], [7, 1]]...where [0.5, 7] is summing the second element of [0.5, 2] and [0.5, 5]...what would be the most efficient way to do this for say lists of length 1,000."
