"why sometimes order of return value by a function varies in blank? i wrote a simple function to retrieve three outputs from a string. when i want to use the returned value in other functions the order changes. .for example:..def parsetrack2(trackstr):..    cardnumber, date = trackstr.split('=').    expiryyear = date[0:2].    expirymonth = date[2:4]..    return{cardnumber,expiryyear,expirymonth}...when i want to pass the cardnumber and expiryyear to another function, sometimes order changes and other times it is right? why is that? ..how should i change it to prevent that variation?"
