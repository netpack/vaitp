"what does this program do? this is a simple program but i am finding difficulty how it is actually working..i have  database with 3 tuples...import matplotlib.pyplot as plt..queries = {}.rewrites = {}.urls = {}...for line in open(""data.tsv""):.    q, r, u = line.strip().split(""t"")..    queries.setdefault(q,0).    queries[q] += 1.    rewrites.setdefault(r,0).    rewrites[r] += 1.    urls.setdefault(u,0).    urls[u] += 1..squeries = [].squeries = [x for x in rewrites.values()].squeries.sort()..x = range(len(squeries)).line, = plt.plot(x, squeries, '-' ,linewidth=2).plt.show()...this is whole program,.now..queries.setdefault(q,0)...this command will set the values as 0 , if key i,e and q is not found...queries[q] += 1...this command will increment the value of each key by 1 if key is there. .same we continue with all tuples..then,.. squeries = [x for x in rewrites.values()]...then we store the values from dictionary rewrites , to list squeries..x = range(len(squeries))..this command i am not getting what is happening. can anyone please explain."
