"blank - multi line stdout refresh issue i have a stats app written in blank that on a timer refreshes the ssh screen with stats. right now it uses os.system('clear') to clear the screen and then outputs a multi line data with the stats...i'd like to do just do a r instead of executing the clear but that only works with one line, is it possible to do this with multiple lines?..a classic example of what i want to do is when you execute the ""top"" command which lists the current processes it updates the screen without executing the ""clear"" and it's got many lines...anyone have any tips for this?"
