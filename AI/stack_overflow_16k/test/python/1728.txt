"accessing variables by their names in a tuple i need to access variables given their names, in the following way:..a = numpy.array([1,2,3]).b = numpy.array([4,5,6]).names = ('a', 'b')...then, i pass the variable names to a function, say numpy.hstack() to obtain the same result as with numpy.hstack((a,b))...what is the best blankic way to do so?..and what is the purpose? i have a function, that accepts names of numpy arrays and stacks the related arrays (defined in the function) together to process them. i need to create all possible combinations of these arrays, hence:...a combination (tuple) of array names is created..the combination (tuple) is passed to a function as an argument..the function concatenates related arrays and processes the result....hopefully this question is not too cryptic. thanks for responses in advance :-)"
