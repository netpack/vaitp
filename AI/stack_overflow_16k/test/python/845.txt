"pass parameter to function if passed by user blank this one should be simple. say i have a function and i call some function from some package within my function. i want to customize passing arguments to the package of the function on whether the user has passed arguments to my function. example code:..import somepackage as sp..def myfunc(foo, bar, baz=none, xad=false):.    # some code to do some stuff....    # then finally:.    if baz is not none:.        sp.somefunc(data=foo, method=bar, aux=baz).    else:.        sp.somefunc(data=foo, method=bar)...is there a way to replace the last 4 lines with just one neat blankic line? something like:..def myfunc(foo, bar, baz=none, xad=false):.    # some code to do some stuff....    # then finally:.    sp.somefunc(data=foo, method=bar, [aux=baz if baz is not none])"
