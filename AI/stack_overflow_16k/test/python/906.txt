"blank reading matrix from file this is for my it class, i am trying to find the sum of each row. its a magic square program. when i run this it says int object not iterable.  also the teacher wants the header of the function like this def rowsum(matrix, rownum) but i dont understand why rownum would be needed. the function should be able to calculate the sum of each row of any size matrix. also i cant use numpy and enumarate as we have not talked about it in class yet...matrix txt file:..1 4.3 2 ...here is code..def main():.    filnam = ""matrix1.txt"".    matrix = (readmatrix(filnam)).    print(eachnumpresent(matrix)).    print(rowsum(matrix))..def readmatrix(filnam):.    matrixfile = open(filnam, ""r"").    line = matrixfile.readline().    for line in matrixfile:.        line = line.split().    return line.    matrixfile.close()..def eachnumpresent(matrix):.    if len(matrix) % 2 == 0:.        return true.    else:.        print(""not enough numbers"")..def rowsum(matrix, rownum):.    for line in matrix:.        return(sum(int(line)))..main()"
