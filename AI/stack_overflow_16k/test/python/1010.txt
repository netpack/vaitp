"make blank script run like a service or agent in windows i have written a blank script that collect some wmi data from machine...i want this script to run 24*7 and get the wmi data...how can i get this script to execute 24/7, such as turning it into agent or service in windows. .i also need a loop that never ends in the program, or can it be done by just having the code re executed multiple times?..thanks..here the basic script. ..import os.import time.import wmi..c = wmi.wmi().def systeminfo1():.    for cpu in c.win32_processor():.        print('cpu_useper', cpu.loadpercentage).        .def systeminfo():.    for mem in c.win32_perfformatteddata_perfos_memory():.        print('memused_perc', mem.percentcommittedbytesinuse).       .while true:.    systeminfo().    time.sleep(5).    systeminfo1().    time.sleep(30)"
