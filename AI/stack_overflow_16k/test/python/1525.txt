"how to make a set all lower case in blank 2.7 i have imported a list of the 5000 most common words using csv and i want to make sure they are all lower case. i also need to make it into a set. is there a special way to do this because it would be way to exhausting to do manually. but should this code work?..with open(""most_common_words.csv"", ""ru"") as csv_file: # opens the file in a 'closure' so that when it's finished it's automatically closed"".    most_common = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter = ',', quotechar = '""') # create a csv reader instance..mcw_set = set(most_common.lower())...thanks!"
