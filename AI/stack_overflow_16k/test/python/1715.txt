"blank program problems so i've been working on this blank code for a few days now. i'm trying to decode a zero-one code i made previously. simply put it hides genomic code.....binary = raw_input ('enter binary code:')..binary = binary.replace('00', 'a').binary = binary.replace('01', 'c').binary = binary.replace('10', 'g').binary = binary.replace('11', 't')..print binary...my issue is, it will accept something like 0110 = cg. but when i add any characters after that it messes up, like 011011 should be cgt instead it's c1cc1. if anyone could identify this issue, or even solve it that would be great."
