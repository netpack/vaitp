"return from blank function but continue execution of the function is it possible to have a function return data to the caller function but continue its execution?..i'm maintaining a web app that requires a client service to be running in the background on the machine of whomever is using the app. the server connects to the client of the user via rpc. the client is a set of blank scripts that are stored on github and it needs to be updatable using a button on the web app. the update requires the client to pull the latest code from github and then restart itself. what i want is for the update method inside of the client to post back information to the server concerning the status of the update, which will then be displayed to the user. so this information would be something like: ""downloading from github..."", ""finished downloading. restarting"", ""successfully updated."""
