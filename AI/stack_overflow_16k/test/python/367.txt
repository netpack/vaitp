"blank, if statements with payroll program hey guys i have to do this payroll program for my programming class, but i'm about to fry my brain, because i can't get to do some if statements with the conditions my assignment is asking for. here's what i have to do ...  .    salespeople at softwarepirates get paid a base salary of $2000 per month. beyond the base salary, each salesperson earns commission on.    the following scale:.    .    sales | commission rate | bonus.     &lt;10000 | 0% | 0.    .    10000 â€“ $100,000 | 2% | 0.    .    $100,001 - $500,00 | 15% | $1000.    .    $500,001 - $1,000,000 | 28% | $5000.    .    $1,000,000 | 35% | $100,000.    .    the following additional conditions apply:.    .    .    if a salesperson has taken more than 3 vacation days in a month, their pay gets reduced by $200.    a salesperson earns a bonus only if they have been with the company for 3 months or more.    for salespeople who have been with the company for more than 5 years and who have made sales greater than $100,000 an additional.    bonus of $1000 is added.    .  ...here's the code i've had so far(it's pretty messy, but i can only use if statements, not while loop or stuff like that since we are following the class book)..name = input(""what's your name? "").time = int(input(""enter the amount of months you've been working for softwarepirates inc.: "")).vacation = input('have you taken more than 3 days of vacations(yes or no) ').sales = float(input(""what were your sales this year? ""))..def comissionone():.    base = 24000.    print(""your commision rate is 0%, so your salary for the year is $"", base).    if time &lt;=3:.        print(""no bonus earned"").    if vacation == 'yes':.        print (""your salary is reduced by $200 for taking more than 3 days off, leaving you at $"", (base-200)).    elif vacation == 'no':.        print()..def comissiontwo():.    base = 24000.    print(""your commision rate is 2%, so your salary for the year is $"", (base*0.02 + base)).    if time &lt;=3:.        print(""no bonus earned"").    if vacation == 'yes':.        print (""your salary is reduced by $200 for taking more than 3 days off, leaving you at $"", (base*0.02 + (base-200))).    elif vacation == 'no':.        print()..def comissionthree():.    print(""your commision rate is 15%, so your salary for the year is $"", (base*0.15 + base)).    if time &lt;=3:.        print(""no bonus earned"").    elif time &gt; 3 and &lt; 60:.        print(""bonus of $1000 earned"").    elif time &gt;= 60:.        print(""bonus of $1000 for being in the company for over 5 years"").    if vacation =='yes':.        print (""your salary is reduced by $200 for taking more than 3 days off, leaving you at $"", (base*0.15 + (base-200))).    elif vacation == 'no':.        print()..def main():..    print(""hi"", name)..    if sales &lt; 10000:.        comissionone().    elif sales &gt;=10000 and sales &lt;=100000:.        comissiontwo().    elif sales &gt;=100001 and sales &lt;=500000:.        comissionthree().    elif sales &gt;=500001 and sales &lt;=1000000:.        print(""your commision rate is 28%, so your salary for the year is $"", (base*0.28 + base)).    elif sales &gt;=1000001:    .        print(""your commision rate is 35%, so your salary for the year is $"", (base*0.35 + base))....main()...thank you, hope anyone can guide me through this! i just don't know how to apply the conditions to the final gross pay."
