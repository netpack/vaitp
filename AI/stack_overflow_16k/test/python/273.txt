"blank: cannot print (execution flow ?) i am interested in a small blank application, which can be downloaded here:.https://launchpad.net/treemap..if you run it, like this:..blank treemap-basic.py examle-world-population.txt...it works just fine..the problem is that even if i type a print command in the ""treemap-basic.py"" file:..print ""hello world !"" @ treemap-basic.py...i cannot see the message ""hello world !"" at the terminal. why?"
