"install a module without pip/easy_install or ""blank setup.py install"" i am trying to install the ptyprocess module: https://github.com/pexpect/ptyprocess...i cannot do a ""pip install ptyprocess"" as my pip is blocked by ssl issues on the server...also, i cannot clone the above repository and run a ""blank setup.py install"" since there is no setup.py in the repository; instead there is a pyproject.toml which requires ""pip install pyproject.yoml"", but again, this is reliant on pip which is blocked...how then can i install this module?..p.s. i've installed other modules on my server via github, but they have the desired ""setup.py"" and not ""pyproject.toml"", therefore i was able to run ""blank setup.py install"" successfully."
