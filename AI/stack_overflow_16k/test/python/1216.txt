"removing weights from a dictionary i have written a blank program which gives me the following output:..{'d': {('b', 2.0), ('e', 1.0), ('c', 2.0)}, 'e': {('d', 1.0), ('b', 4.0), ('c', 3.0)}, ..'a': {('b', 1.0), ('c', 5.0)}, 'b': {('a', 1.0), ('d', 2.0), ('e', 4.0)}, 'c': {('e', 3.0), .('a', 5.0), ('d', 2.0)}`}`...these are nodes of a graph and their corresponding weights. i am trying to remove weights from the above output. can anyone help me with this.? my output should look something like this :..{ ""a"" : [""b"",""c""],""b"" : [""a"", ""e"",""d""],""c"" : [""a"", ""d"", ""e""],.          ""d"" : [""b"",""c"",""e""],""e"" : [""b"", ""c"",""d""] }"
