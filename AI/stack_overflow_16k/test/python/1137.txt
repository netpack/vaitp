"while statement and def function i'm learning the def function and wrote this code:..def thirdpower(number):.    n=number**3.    print ""%d to the 3rd power is %d"" % (number,n).thirdpower(input(""enter a number""))...but now, i want to add in a conditional statement (perhaps using the while statement) so that if a user leaves the input blank, it will print out an error, and will re-ask the user...so far, i can't figure it out:..def thirdpower(number):.        n=number**3.while true:.    if len(thirdpower())==0:.        print ""%d to the 3rd power is %d"" % (number,n).        thirdpower(input(""enter a number"")).    break.else:.    print ""you entered a blank, please try again.""...any input is apreciated!! :)"
