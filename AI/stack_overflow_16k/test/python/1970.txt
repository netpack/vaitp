"why import specific sub-packages in blank when the entire package has already been imported? i am not a blank programmer, but i read a lot of blank scripts that import sub-packages from whole packages already imported...for example:..  import multiprocessing.  from multiprocessing import process...what exactly is the purpose of importing process specifically when its entire parent package, multiprocessing, has already been imported?"
