"what is the best code to suit this operation? just started working with blank, less than one week. and this exercise came in. i managed to find this code online and i started to get the hand of it:..""a snail falls at the bottom of a 125 cm well. each day the snail rises 30 cm. but at night, while sleeping, slides 20 cm because the walls are wet. how many days does it take to escape from the well?..-assign problem data to variables with representative names.well height, daily advance, night retreat, accumulated distance..well_height = 125..daily_advance = 30..night_retreat = -20..accumulated_distance = daily_advance + night_retreat..totalcms = 0...-assign 0 to the variable that represents the solution..days = 0...-write the code that solves the problem..snailhasnotescaped = true.while snailhasnotescaped:.    totalcms += accumulated_distance.    days += 1.if totalcms &gt;= well_height:.snailhasnotescaped = false...-print the result with print('days =', days)..print(""days = "", days, ""days"")""...now its asking me this set of questions:..the distance traveled by the snail is now defined by a list...advance_cm = [30, 21, 33, 77, 44, 45, 23, 45, 12, 34, 55]...how long does it take to raise the well?.what is its maximum displacement in one day? and its minimum?.what is its average speed during the day?.what is the standard deviation of its displacement during the day?..could someone help me?.thank you in advance"
