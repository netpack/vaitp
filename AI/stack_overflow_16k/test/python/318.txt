"what is the use of this combination of operators in blank, ""  <return> | ""? well, i ran over a piece of code and i could not quite figure out its function. .it goes like this: ..thresholds = (image[:,:,0] &lt; rgbthreshold[0]) .            | (image[:,:,1] &lt; rgbthreshold[1]) .            | (image[:,:,2] &lt; rgbthreshold[2])...it's that bit over there, ...   &lt;""return""> | (image[:,:,1] &lt; .... ...i can't quite figure out what it does. ..if anyone is wondering what this code is meant to be doing, there are a set of rgb thresholds (redthreshold, green....) and an image ""image"". ..i just select all the pixels that are below the specified threshold. then i access them by colorselect[threshold] = [0,0,0] i.e. blacken them (colorselect is a numpy array that represents an image by its rbg pixel values.)"
