"global variable in blank, is this normal behaviour? i have been using winblank for coding a program that uses a global variable, this is the code:..def main():.    global listc.    listc=[1,2,3,4,5]..def dosomething():.    if listc!=[]:.        pass...the problem that i have is that the line that says if listc!=... throws me a warning that says ""undefined name listc""; this program actually compiles and executes normally, but i would like to know why that warning appears if i have declared list as a global variable...i would like to execute it in the following way:..programname.main()       //init the list.programname.dosomething()    //do an operation with the list.programname.dosomething()     //same as before.......thanks"
