"getting highest value card in list i have a list of cards:..    hand = [""kc"", ""qc"", ""4c"", ""0s""]...and i always want to get the highest card in terms of rank, like in this list..    rank_cards = [""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""0"", ""j"", ""q"", ""k"", ""a""]...the highest card in this case would be:..    ""kc""...how can i do this for any sort of hand i get?..i was thinking of using a dictionary to rank cards in terms of index, like this:..    d = {}.    for i, c in enumerate(rank_cards):.        d[c] = i...is there a better way to do this?..thanks"
