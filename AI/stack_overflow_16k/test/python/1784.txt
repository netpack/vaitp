what is the shortest way to set a value of a variable based on user input i have some large number of boolean values e.g..bool1 = false.bool2 = false.....booln = false...user runs the program and provides the name of a bool to be set to true. e.g blank run.py bool100..is there a way to implement it in one or few lines without having n-depth if elif statement?..thank you..edit: clarification -- these are plain bool variables and i cannot convert them into dictionaries or lists
