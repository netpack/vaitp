"how to count the occurence and number of duplicates in a list? i am trying to count the duplicate characters of strings in a list; additionally i increment a variable depending on whether it is a duplicate 2 or 3 times...however, out of my 250 string test list, it is returning a total count of 641, so i'm sure something's wrong...here is my code:..def finddupesnum(listy):.    a = []      # the current string's character list.    b = 0       # the 2-dupe counter.    c = 0       # the 3-dupe counter.    for i in listy:.        a.clear().        for x in i:.            if x in a and a.count(x) == 1 and x != '':.                b += 1.            elif x in a and a.count(x) == 2 and x != '':.                c += 1.                b -= 1.            a.append(x).        print('b = ' + str(b) + ' and c = ' + str(c))"
