"blank declare object functions at init suppose i have a class that's passed a set of options...for example: ..class thing(object): .    def __init__(self, options): .        self.name = options['name'].        if options['material'] == 'organic': .            self.living = options['living'] .            if self.living: .                self.kingdom = options['kingdom'] .        else:.            self.material = options['material'] ...so if it's material and organic, it will have an additional option specifying if it's living, if it's living it will also have a kingdom etc. ..suppose i want to define a function in class thing that will for example:..def belongtokingdom(self): .    print self.kingdom...but i only want such a function defined at __init__ if kingdom is passed in options, otherwise ignored. what's the correct way to accomplish this ?"
