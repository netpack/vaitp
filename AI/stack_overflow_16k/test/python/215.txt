"get rid of all white spaces in between lines so say i had some text like this:..line num 1.line num 2..line num 3....line num 4...i am trying to get rid of all the new lines in  between line 2 and 3 and line 3 and 4 while having all of the line num on separate new lines. how would i accomplish this? i have already tried puth=ing them into a list then looping throught them and taking out all of the lone 'n'..ex:..obj=['line num 1','line num 2','n','line num 3','n','n','line num4'].a=-1.for i in obj:.    a+=1.    if i=='n':.        print 'yes'.        del obj[a]...print obj...output:..['line num 1', 'line num 2', 'line num 3', 'n', 'line num4']...it catches some but not all."
