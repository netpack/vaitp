"blank: what does d = _ mean? at 44:05 in his fun of reinvention talk, dave beasley writes ..&gt;&gt;&gt; d = _...there is a lot before that, which is necessary for the result he gets. but ignoring the output, what does that input line mean? whenever i try it, either in a file in the pycharm editor, in the pycharm blank console, using straight idle (all v3.7) i get an error...any idea what this may mean and how to get something like that to run?..thanks"
