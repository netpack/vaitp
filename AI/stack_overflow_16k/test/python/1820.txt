"what constitutes a blank environment i have been working with blank for a few years now and theres a concept i still can't get through my head...what constitutes a fully operational environment? by which i mean what are the minimum system settings which are required to be able to start a blank session and import modules?..i have noticed that two environment variables are important for blank in windows. they are as follows..path..blankpath..i am sure other things are necessary, and it is those things that i am asking about. is there an official guideline for this in the blank docs? what do third party environment tools like conda and virtualenv use? is is possible to do away with such tools and construct environments oneself?"
