"item in a list - blank i am trying to write a simple function to check if both of the list hold the same items, even if they are not in the same order. for example:..list1 = (""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e"",""f"")..list2 = (""f"",""c"",""b"",""d"",""e"",""a"")..if list2 == list 1 (in any order):.   print(""list 1 and list 2 are similar."")..else:.    print(""list 1 and list 2 are different"")...i am trying to find out if list 2 and list 1 both hold the same items."
