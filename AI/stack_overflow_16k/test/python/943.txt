"how do i find market equilibrium with two market actors (firm setting price and government setting excise tax) in blank? i'm trying to find equilibrium in a market with given demand function, a firm maximizing its profits and the government setting excise tax to maximize tax income. i wrote code for the maximization problems the firm and government use to maximize their profit/taxes. now i'm not sure what the next step is to find the equilibrium. can anyone help me with the next step?..i think i have to define a fixed point and use that to solve for equilibrium. in the classes i had at my university we only did this for cournot equilibrium with multiple firms. i'm not sure how to do this in this situation with a firm and government setting excise tax. later i want to add a second product (substite or complement) to the model, but i need to figure out how to solve for equilibrium price and excise tax in this more simple model based on best responses first...this is the code i have written, i'm looking for the next step to solve for equilibrium price and excise tax based on their best responses...from scipy import stats, optimize..alpha1 = 10.beta1 = -0.5.c1 = 0.5..def q1(p1,t1):.    return alpha1+beta1*p1*(1+t1)..def profits1(p1,t1,c1):.    return q1(p1,t1)*(p1-c1)..def taxes(t1,p1):.    return q1(p1,t1)*p1*t1..def reactionfirm1(t1,c1):.    p1 = optimize.fminbound(lambda x: -profits1(x,t1,c1),0,100).    return p1..def reactiongovernment1(p1):.    t1 = optimize.fminbound(lambda x: -taxes(x,p1),0,100).    return t1...solving this with pen and paper gives t1=3.73 and p1=2.36 (both rounded)...to solve it with pen and paper, i first find the best responses of the firm and government. for the firm the best response is found by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to p1, putting this equal to 0 and writing p1 as a function of t1. which gives:..p1 = (10.25+0.25t1)/(1+t)..similarly, for the best response of the government can be found by taking the first derivative of tax income with respect to t1, putting this equal to 0 and writing t1 as a function of p1, which gives:..t1 = 10/p1 -0.5..to find p1 and t1, you either plug in t1 into p1 or p1 into t1 and solve it...so i plugged in p1 into t1 to get:..t1 = (10+10t)/(10.25+0.25t) -0.5..which gives t1 = 3.73..and by plugging t1 = 3.73 in the best response of the firms i get p1 = 2.36..what i was hoping to do with blank is computing and solving the best responses of the firm and government to find t1 and p1. because i want to expand the model, which makes it more complicated to solve by pen and paper. also, by having it in blank it will be easier to change the paramaters alpha1, beta1 and c1 to see how the optimum p1 and t1 change."
