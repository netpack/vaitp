"blank: create variable from loop that reads text file and extracts single column i'm new to blank and was hoping for some assistance please. ..i have a small script that reads a text file and prints only the fist column using a for loop: ..list = open(""/etc/jbstorelist"").for column in list:.    print(column.split()[0])...but i would like to take all the lines printed in the for loop and create one single variable for it. ..in other words, the text file /etc/jbstorelist has 3 columns and basically i want a list with only the first column, in the form of a single variable. ..any guidance would be appreciated. thank you."
