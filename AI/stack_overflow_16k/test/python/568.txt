"blank print data to stout in the format blank sees. ie raw. the program hex.py (code is from hex.py) has previously loaded a hex.patch file which has 3 items of info .1.the target file to open (in this case tar = a windows.exe file).2.old (the data to find in the exe) .3.new (the data to replace old in the exe). .    the old/new will either be written as hex (64000000 or 6400 0000) or as text in who knows what format utf8 utf16?. .    i need to be able to see the patch file 'old' and 'new' data and the tar file data in the same format that blank does (before it translates it to me) so i can write the correction factor routines..hex.py: ..    modcwd = os.getcwd() #assign var to modman dir.    patch = 'hex.patch' #hardcode patch to var.    patlst = [line.strip() for line in open(patch,'rb',1)] #read patch start.    tar = patlst[patlst.index('tar:')+1];old = patlst[patlst.index('old:')+1];new = patlst[  pat.index('new:')+1].    #start sub to determine if data hex or alpha.    a = old [:8].    count = lambda l1, l2: len(list(filter(lambda c: c in l2, l1))).    a_chars =  count(a, string.ascii_letters) .    a_digits = count(a, string.digits) .    if (a_chars/a_digits) &gt; .45 : alphex = 'a'.    else: alphex = 'h'.    if alphex == 'h' : old = ''.join(old.split()); new = ''.join(new.split()).    oldlc = [o.lower() for o in old];old = ''.join(oldlc).    newlc = [n.lower() for n in new];new = ''.join(newlc).    #load open exe file.    pircwd = os.chdir('..'); pircwd = os.getcwd().    fotar = open(tar,'rb').    data = fotar.read(160).    hdata = (binascii.hexlify(data)).    bus = re.sub(old,new,hdata).    fobus = open ('newhex','wb').    fobus.write(bus).    fobus.close().    fotar.close()..the complete hex.patch :.tar: .hex!.exe.old:.2068 6572 652c 2073 7765 6574 6965 2e0a.new:.2068 6572 652c 2073 6578 792e 2e2e 2e0a.eof:...as of now it is finding the correct data, i.e 'old' = data(matching substring) and is writing the file 'bus' but the 1st line of the 'bus' file is not the hex has been swapped for the 'new' hex it has swapped out 'new' as a text value instead."
