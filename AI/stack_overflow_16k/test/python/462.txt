"blank efficiency: counting key occurrences in dict trying to get the unique values of a dict key and the # of times they appear in the list. this works, but feels janky:..a = [ {'pid': 1 }, {'pid': 1}, {'pid': 1}, {'pid': 2}, {'pid': 2}, {'pid': 3} ].b = { x['pid']: len([f for f in a if f['pid'] == x['pid']]) for x in a }.b...yielding:..{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}...is there a nicer way?"
