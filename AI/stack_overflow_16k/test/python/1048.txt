"blank nested loop problems with validation i'm creating a work log where a user can input a task or lookup a task by dates...when looking up task by date, the user is presented with a list of dates.  the user can then select from the list by entering a number.  the list of tasks should then display for that specific date.  ..i'm just having a problem if the user enters a number not in the list of dates. you can see else statement at the end of method which is commented out---which had been causing a few issues.  everything works fine otherwise.  so question--how do i provide error message if input from user is not in index list without printing out the message every time it loops through the list?..def search_by_date(self):.    for i, d in enumerate(self.tasklist.dates()):.        enum_list = [(i+1,d) for i,d in enumerate(self.tasklist.dates())].        print(i+1, ':', d).    while true:.        datereq = input(""select number to see tasks for a date: "").strip().        try:.            datereq = int(datereq)..        except valueerror:.            print(""invalid entry"").            continue..        else:.            for i, d in enum_list:.                for task in self.tasklist.task_list:.                    if datereq == i:.                        if task.date == d:.                            print(""date :"", task.date,.                                  "" task:"", task.task,.                                  "" minutes:"", task.minutes,.                                  "" notes: "", task.notes.                                  ).                            continue..                    #else:.                        #print(""invalid entry. please try again"").                        #continue"
