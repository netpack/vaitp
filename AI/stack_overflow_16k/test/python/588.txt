"blank searching 2d arrays and returning if found and index found at i have a 2d array which may or may not contain data. first i want to search for the index that contains specific data and if true then update the data in the array...so far i have managed to search the array and return a true or false statement if the index is found. but i also need to return the index value so i can then modify and update the data in the array...from itertools import chain.self.asset= [[]]..def findin2darray(self, arr, value):.    return value in chain.from_iterable(arr)..if self.findin2darray(self.asset, element.get(""asset"")):.     print(""found updating"").     self.asset[???, 1] = new updated value...i know which columns i will need to change but i don't know the index location of the data, hope that makes sense. it would be good if the findin2darray function would also return the index number, thanks!"
