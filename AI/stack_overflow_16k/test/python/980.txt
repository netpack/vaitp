"interact with web pages using blank i am quite fluent in blank, but have only really used it for data analysis...i would like to learn how i can interact with webpages. for instance, i want to start by writing a code that will press a button on a webpage for me...i just don't know where to start or what to google to find resources about this...could anyone point me out in the right directions, or suggest some key words that i could search for?..thanks."
