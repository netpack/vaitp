"change current directory for user in blank i want to change a user's current working directory when they run a blank script. for example, if i have the following script called chdir.py:..import os.os.chdir('desktop')...i want to be able to do this:..$ pwd./users/me.$ blank chdir.py.$ pwd./users/me/desktop...i know that os.chdir(path) changes the working directory during the runtime, but it resets when the script exits. is there any way to prevent this?"
