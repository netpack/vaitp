"combine lines when writing to file in blank? so i'm trying to write all this info to a .txt file, but due to the names being pulled from a .txt file that goes..liam..noah..william..etc.....when i write to a file, it puts the first and last names on separate lines from everything else...i've looked on stackoverflow for a solution but i couldn't find anything specific enough...password = input('enter the password you would like to use ')..open('names.txt', 'r+').lines = open(""names.txt"").readlines() .firstname = lines[0] .words = firstname.split() .firstnamechoice = random.choice(lines)..open('names.txt', 'r+').lines = open(""names.txt"").readlines() .lastname = lines[0] .words = lastname.split() .lastnamechoice = random.choice(lines)....def signup():.    randomnumber = str(random.randint(0,10000))..    accountfile = open('accounts.txt', 'a').    accountfile.write(firstnamechoice).    accountfile.write(lastnamechoice).    accountfile.write(randomnumber).    accountfile.write('@').    accountfile.write(catchall).    accountfile.write(':').    accountfile.write(password).    accountfile.write('n')..signup()..expectation would be everything printed to one line but that's not the case."
