"how to create a dictionary whose values are sets? i'm working on an exercise that requires me to build two dictionaries, one whose keys are country names, and the values are the gdp. this part works fine...the second dictionary is where i'm lost, as the keys are supposed to be the letters a‚Äêz and the values are sets of country names. i tried using a for loop, which i've commented on below, where the issue lies...if the user enters a string with only one letter (like a), the program should print all the countries that begin with that letter. when you run the program, however, it only prints out one country for each letter...the text file contains 228 lines. ie:..1:qatar:98900..2:liechtenstein:89400..3:luxembourg:80600..4:bermuda:69900..5:singapore:59700..6:jersey:57000..etc....and here's my code...initials = [].countries=[].incomes=[]..dictionary={}.dictionary_2={}..keywordfile = open(""raw.txt"", ""r"")..for line in keywordfile:.    line = line.upper().    line = line.strip(""n"").    line = line.split("":"")  .    initials.append(line[1][0])  # first letter of second element.    countries.append(line[1])  .    incomes.append(line[2])..for i in range(0,len(countries)):.    dictionary[countries[i]] = incomes[i]...this for loop should spit out 248 values (one for each country), where the key is the initial and the value is the country name. however, it only spits out 26 values (one country for each letter in the alphabet)..for i in range(0,len(countries)):.    dictionary_2[initials[i]] = countries[i].    print(dictionary_2)..while true:.    inputs = str(input('enter an initial or a country name.'))..    if inputs in dictionary:.        value = dictionary.get(inputs, """").        print(""the per capita income of {} is {}."".format((inputs.title()), value ))..    elif inputs in dictionary_2:.        value = dictionary_2.get(inputs).        print(""the countries that begin with the letter {} are: {}."".format(inputs, (value.title())))..    elif inputs.lower() in ""quit"":.        break..    else:.        print(""does not exit."")..print(""end of session."")...i'd appreciate any input leading me in the right direction."
