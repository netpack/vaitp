"adding to empty set empty_set = set()...how would i use a loop to add 10 random integers, all from 10 to 30 inclusive, to the above empty set?..also how do i use another loop to process the set that displays all elements of the set on one line separated by ** and that counts how many elements are even and how many elements are odd and then displays the counts?..trying to output it like something similar to below:..12**16**17**18**20**21**22**23**24**28**.set has 7 even numbers and 3 odd numbers...from what heinst helped me with, i am trying to change the list to a set...is this right at all?..import random....numbers = set().for _ in range(0, 10):.numbers.add(random.randrange(10, 30)).printstr = ''.evens = 0.odds = 0.for num in numbers:.printstr += '{0}**'.format(num).if num % 2 == 0:.    evens += 1.else:.    odds += 1..print (printstr)..print ('set has {0} even numbers and {1} odd numbers'.format(evens, odds))"
