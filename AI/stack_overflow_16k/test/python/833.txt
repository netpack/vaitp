"blank 3.3 password checker i am creating a program that checks passwords to see if they are strong enough: ...they need caps, .lower case, .numbers, .symbols and .cannot contain easy passwords....as you can see below this is only some of my code and i have a menu, and a password checker, the only problem is that the checker doesn't seem to be working as when i enter a password, its always saying its a strong password even though it does not contain any caps or numbers or symbols. below is my code so far.  ..import random #importing random.import time #importing time.global menu..def menu():.    global optionchoice #globalising variable optionchoice so that it can be used inside of another def of the code.    print(""hey, welcome to passwordchecker."").    time.sleep(2) #delaying the next line for 2 seconds.    print(""please choose one of the options below."" ).    time.sleep(1).    print(""menu:"").    print(""***"").    print(""    press 1 once for              :           password checker  "").    print(""    press 2 twice for             :           password generator"").    print(""    press 3 two or three times to :           quit              "").    print(""                                                                 ***"") #creating a basic menu.    optionchoice = (input(""which option would you like to choose?""))..def checkpasswordandinput():.    global optionchoice.    optionchoice = optionchoice.    if optionchoice == '1':.        print("" please enter a password. "").        userpassword = input("""").        if len(userpassword) &lt;= 8 or len(userpassword) &gt;= 24 or userpassword == userpassword.isupper() or userpassword == userpassword.isdigit() or userpassword == userpassword.islower() or userpassword == userpassword.isalpha():.            print(""make sure your password includes numbers and upper and lower case letters  "").            userpassword = input('please enter a new password').        else:.            print('your password is a very good one that is difficult to crack').            return menu()...notes to future readers:..please do not write code in the form above:...do not import modules you don't need.do not use global variables.do use loops: eg while true:.do call functions from other functions.do return values from one function back to the caller: optionchoice = menu()...the above code would have been better in this form:..import time..def menu():.    print(""    press 1 for password checker  "").    print(""    press 2 for password generator"").    print(""    press 3 to quit"").    return input(""which option would you like to choose?"")..def checkpasswordandinput():.    while true:.        optionchoice = menu().        if optionchoice == '1':.            #enter password and validate.            pass.        # detect other options.        if optionchoice == '3':.            break...checkpasswordandinput()"
