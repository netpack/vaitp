"finding matches in two strings and marking those matches. blank i'm trying to find matches between two strings of the same length and i'm using the following code...import operator..seq1 = input(""type the first sequence: "").seq2 = input(""type the second sequence: "")..if len(seq1) != len(seq2):.    print(""sequences must be of the same length"")..else:.    for i in range(len(seq1)):.        if (seq1[i] == seq2[i]):.            print (""there are"", sum(map(operator.eq, seq1, seq2)), ""matches:""+""n"", seq1+""n"", seq2+""n"", ""*""*sum(map(operator.eq, seq1, seq2)))...the problem is that i want to put the ""*"" in the matched positions and i don't know how to indicate those positions. .another problem is that when i want to print the results, they are repeated once for every match. i can show you an example:..type the first sequence: atcga.type the second sequence: aacca.there are 3 matches:. atcga. aacca. ***.there are 3 matches:. atcga. aacca. ***.there are 3 matches:. atcga. aacca. ***...and what i really want is the following:..type the first sequence: atcga.type the second sequence: aacca.there are 3 matches:. atcga. aacca. * * *"
