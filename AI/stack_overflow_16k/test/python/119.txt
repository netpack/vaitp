"extract the n-th element from a list of list of list i have a list of list of list and i would like to extract the n-th element from each sub-sub list. for example, given the following list:..my_list = [[[0, 0], [1, 1]], [[2, 0], [3, 2]], [[2, 0], [3, 3]], [[4, 0], [5, 4]], [[6, 0], [7, 5]]]...i want to extract all the first elements keeping the structure of the original list (list of list of list), like:..all_first_elements = [[[0],[1]], [[2],[3]], [[2],[3]], [[4],[5]], [[6],[7]]]...the problem is similar to this one but with one additional nested list. ..i have tried all_first_elements = [item[0] for item in my_list] but it returns the first elements of the list of list (and not the first elements of list of list of list)."
