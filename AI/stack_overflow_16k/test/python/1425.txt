"blank challenge- #3: it prints random letters instead of 7 import re..b=re.findall('[a-z]+[a-z]+[a-z]',k)..for i in b:.    print (i)...i have written this code. the string in k is too long to print here.. i need to find all sets of sub strings where the middle later is in lower case and three letters exactly on each side is upper case. .i think this code should work. but, its printing random number of letters in each substring ..what is the problem in my code or how can i fix it ?.please help!"
