"code runs else statement repeatedly every time the below code runs, it goes straight through to the first else statement, then runs the next else statement four times.  what is going on and how do i fix it so it calls the movement() module?    ..class square(object):.    def __init__(self,updown,leftright,residence,name):.        self.updown = updown.        self.leftright = leftright.        self.residence = bool.        self.name = name..    a1 = square(1,1,true,""a1"").    a2 = square(2,1,false,""a2"").    b1 = square(1,2,false,""b1"").    b2 = square(2,2,false,""b2"")..    square_dict = {a1:""a1"",a2:""a2"",b1:""b1"",b2:""b2""}.    movement_select().. def movement_select():.    response = raw_input(""where would you like to move?"").    if response in square_dict:.        moveto = square_dict[response].    else:.        print ""this runs once"".    for a in square_dict:.        if a.residence == true:.            movefrom = a.            movement(movefrom,moveto).        else:.            print ""this runs four times"".movement_select()"
