"best way to handle a nested for loop? i'm attempting to save records to my database based on the selected options in a form...the code i'm trying to use keeps telling me that j does not exists in the and j in previouscourselist...if request.method == 'post':.    for i in courselist and j in previouscourselist:.        requestsave(courselist and = i, previouscourselist= j)...using the following below.  the records loops through correctly for the first part using for i in courselist .  previouscourselist will be wrote as a list [####,####,####] etc.  however, this is not what i want...   if request.method == 'post':.        for i in courselist.            requestsave(courselist = i, previouscourselist= previouscourselist)...what is the proper way to nest a forloop, so it loops through the courselist list and the previouscourselist?  writing individual records where there is a different courselist and previouscourselist?..what i'm trying to accomplish is to have my requestsave(courselist = i, and previouscourselist = j)  so it's written like this:..courseid   previouscourseid.2000       1001.2000       1015.2001       1001.2001       1015.2002       1001.2002       1015...current using ..  if request.method == 'post':.        for i in courselist.            requestsave(courselist = i, previouscourselist= previouscourselist)...it writes the statement above to the database as ..courseid    previouscourse.2000        [1001, 1015].2001        [1001, 1015].2002        [1001, 1015]"
