"when would `if false` execute in blank? while browsing some code, i came across this line:..if false: #shedskin...i understand that shedskin is a kind of blank -> c++ compiler, but i can't understand that line...shouldn't if false: never execute? what's going on here?..for context:..this is the whole block:..if false: # shedskin.    astar(sq_maphandler([1], 1, 1)).findpath(sq_location(1,1), sq_location(1,1))...more context is on google code (scroll down all the way)."
