"blank simpler way to find missing items in a list in relation to another list i was struggling to properly title this question but i will try and explain this situation...i have two lists..l1=['beststreet', 'borocd', 'am_linkid3', 'bestfrom', 'resurf19', 'rmmweekly'].l2=['beststreet', 'borocd', 'bestfrom', 'rmmweekly','weird','noises']...l1 will always remain the same. ..l2 can either contain the exact items as l1 or have only some of the items as l1 and in any scenario there can be extra items in the list. ..goal: find only the missing items in l2 that are in l1 (disregard the extra items in l2)..here is my full code for this, it works totally fine i just feel like i am overthinking this and what i want can have a simpler more blankic workflow..l1=['beststreet', 'borocd', 'am_linkid3', 'bestfrom', 'resurf19', 'rmmweekly'].l2=['beststreet', 'borocd', 'bestfrom', 'rmmweekly','weird','noises']..result = [[n if n in l1 else none, n if n in l2 else none] for n in set(l1 + l2)]..missing_columns=[].for r in result:.    if none in r:.        exists= [z for z in l1 if z in r].        if exists:.            missing_columns.append(exists[0]).print missing_columns"
