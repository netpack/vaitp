"repl signal for completion of a computation i am building a web interface to a blank interpreter. is there an accepted way to interact with an interpreter so that it can signal that a computation is complete?..for example:..&gt;&gt;&gt; 1+1.2.&gt;&gt;&gt;...other than checking for &gt;&gt;&gt;, how can i know that the interpreter has completed its evaluation of the given expression?"
