"why doesn't `if count is 5` work properly? i am developing an application that has a website and a series of keywords and queries the google api at what position they are up to page 5...for example:..website: `www.stackoverflow.com`.keywords: `web design`, `programming`, `help`...this will search up to the 5th page on google and if it's not found then it will create an object with the keyword and the position would be ""n/a""...i have created the following recusive function:..def getrankingsfromgoogle(keyword, website, page = 1, count = 1): ..    if count is 5: .       print ""not on page 5"" ..    service = build(""customsearch"", ""v1"",.              developerkey="""")..    res = service.cse().list(.        q=keyword, .        cx='',.        start=page, .    ).execute()..    obj = parsegoogleresponse(res, keyword, website)..    if not bool(obj):.        print ""adding object to database.."".        return .    else:.        page = page + 10 .        count += 1.        getrankingsfromgoogle(keyword, website, page, count)...def main(): ..    websites = gettrackedwebsites(); ..    for website in websites: ..        keywords = website['keywords']..        for keyword in keywords: .            getwebsiterankingsbykeywords(keyword, website['website'])...the function goes into the else statement, but never actually reaches the if count is 5 which is where i need it to be in order to create the object for the keyword was not found...i have also created another script:..def getrankingsfromgoogle(keyword, website, page = 1, count = 1):..    if count is 5: .        print ""yay"".        return;..    page = 10.    count += 1..    print page .    getrankingsfromgoogle(""asf"", ""www.google.com"", page, count)...getrankingsfromgoogle(""af"", ""www.google.com"", 1, 1)...which reaches the condition count is 5...i don't understand why this recursive function is not working."
