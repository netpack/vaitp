"except being an invalid syntax i asked a related question here about this. however, i still have one problem...import sys .import calendar..trueval = 'yes' .while trueval ==  'yes' :  .. yy = int(input(""enter year: "")) . mm = int(input(""enter month: "")). break. except valueerror:.     print ""oops!  that was not an integer.  try again..."".. print(calendar.month(yy, mm))#returns the result.. cmd=input(""would you like to view another calendar? type yes if you do, no to exit program"") ...if cmd != trueval :.   sys.exit()...apparently, my prof wants me to put an error message for users who input strings. so i put that except function but it doesn't recognize it."
