"struggling to get the sum() function to output one value from a list olst = [].elst = []..e = int(input(""please enter your first number:  "")).o = int(input(""please enter your second number:  "")).for os in range(e,o+1):.    if(os%2!=0):.        olst.append(os)..for es in range(e,o+1):.    if(es%2==0):.        elst.append(es)..    print(""sum of all odd values is:  "", sum(olst)).    print(""sum of all even values is:  "", sum(elst))...this programs intention is to print the sum of all odd numbers between my two integers as well as the even. this is my current code, i'm fairly new to blank and tinkering around, open to any criticism and tips. the main issue i'm having is when i run my program both sum(olst) and sum(elst) output the answer multiple times until they reach the correct and final answer. get the feeling my process is fundamentally flawed somewhere early on but hoping that's not the case!"
