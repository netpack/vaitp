"how do i improve my pausing and resuming system in my game code? so i have this idea of making a game, the content doesnt really matter as i got it nailed down, but the main problem comes to the pausing and the resuming part, since i need to have check points to check if one part is already viewed by the player(story parts), it makes it complex and long as i have to separate every story bits into lots of def if i wanted to make it pausable anytime, but i want to improve it so i can compile all the story and combat parts into a few definitions, ..below is my current build of the code, i will but comments in lines where i did the pausing resuming thingy to reduce confusion...the menu part:..def menu(): .#displays menu, contains return, charcter stats and gears, current xp .#use cp as checkpoints after each input function, when resuming just load checkpoint and start.    print('     type the %s%skeyletter%s to navigate     '%(cyan,bold,empty)).    print('                 %s%sr%sesume                 '%(cyan,bold,empty)).    print('               view %s%ss%stats               '%(cyan,bold,empty)).    print('               view %s%sg%sears               '%(cyan,bold,empty)).    print('             save and %s%sq%suit              '%(cyan,bold,empty)).    while true:.        option = input().        if option == 'r' or option == 'r':.            re = cp                 #cp being the checkpoints, re being.            story1(re)              #the return points.            return false            #(cp handles pausing, re handles resuming)...the story(and the part i'm stuck at for resuming):..def story1(re):.    global cp            #set cp as global variable so when i pause and go to .    cp = 1               #the menu screen it ""saves"" the checkpoint for.    if re != 1:          #resuming.        re = 2.        story2(re).    print('line 1').    print('press enter to continue or p to pause').    option = input('').    if option == 'p' or option == 'p':.        menu().    else:.        re = 2.        story2(re)..def story2(re):.    global cp.    cp = 2.    if re != 2:        #checks if story1 has its own checkpoint, if not then.        re = 3         #start story2, so on and so forth.        story3(re).    print('line 2').    print('press enter to continue or p to pause').    option = input('').    if option == 'p' or option == 'p':.        menu().    else:.        re = 3.        story3(re)...the main problem i want to solve is to compile the system so i can put story1 and story 2 into 1 def but still have the ability to pause and resume at where it was..line 1.press enter to continue or p to pause..line 2.press enter to continue or p to pause.p.     type the keyletter to navigate     .                 resume                 .               view stats               .               view gears               .             save and quit              .r.line 2.press enter to continue or p to pause...i can make it work but it is too complex and separates the storyline like its butter ;~;"
