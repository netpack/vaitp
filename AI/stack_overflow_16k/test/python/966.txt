"i need help fixing my code - very fragile i'm very new to blank and for my assignment i have to program a simple 'higher or lower' style game. ..i'm currently trying to make it so the user can't crash the game by entering an invalid input, but i'm stuck at the point where it asks the user to decide how much money they want to start with...i tried a few things but i mostly always get this error: ..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""c:/users/liam/desktop/game test 2-6-6.py"", line 36, in &lt;module&gt;.    print(""nbank account: £"", ltdbank_account).nameerror: name 'ltdbank_account' is not defined...trying to learn as much as i can so any help to fix this or anything else in my code would be greatly appreciated!..edit: i should also mention this is on blank 3.4.3 if that matters..import random..highlow = true..while highlow == true:.    ltdplay = input(""would you like to play higher or lower?
