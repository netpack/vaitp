"how to get the averagepopulation to work i have written this program to read though a list of the us census from 1900 to 2000. singleyear works printlist works and if name works but for averagepopulation i can't figure out how to get the average of the two dates i input. ..import math..f = open('c:/blank34/us_census.txt')..f.readline()..def singleyear(year):.    totalyears = 0.    for line in f:.        yearlist = line.split().        totalyears = totalyears + 1.        if year == yearlist[2]:.            population = yearlist[3]..    print(line[0], '/' , line[3], '/', year , 'there were', population, 'in the united states.')..def averagepopulation(year1, year2):.    for line in f:.        yearlist = line.split().        if year1 == yearlist [2]:.            population = yearlist[3].        if year2 == yearlist [2]:.            population = yearlist[3]..    print((year1-year2)/2)..def printlist():.    for line in f:.        print(line)...if __name__ =='__main__':.    cont=1.    while cont !=0:.        print('''.            1:get population for a single year between 1900 and 2000.            2: get average population on a range of years between 1900 and 2000.            3: show the whole list..            0: exit program''')..        ans = input(""enter your selectiion (0-3)"").        if ans == '1':.            singleyear(input(""enter a valid year(1900-2000)"")).        if ans == '2':.            averagepopulation(input(""first year""),input(""second year"")).        if ans == '3':.            printlist().        if ans == '0':.            cont = 0"
