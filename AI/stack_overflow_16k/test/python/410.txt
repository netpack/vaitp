"which index to use in order to access items in defaultdict i am using var_dict = defaultdict(list)..then the key is 'node' and value is a list..i am able to iterate thru the values. but if i want to access elements ['1974'], ['993'],['198']... in this example can you please tell me what what would be the for loop construction for this...var_dict['node'].[[['1013'], ['1974'], ['0/5']], [['1013'], ['993'], ['0/9']], [['9999'], ['198'], ['0/5']], [['9999'], ['992'], ['0/9']]]...i am able to iterate thru dictionary values given a key. my question is, what if i want to access items ..for item in node_ps_if_list['if_pse2']:.    for item1 in item:...will list the respective value. what i need is to access the second element like zz[0][1], zz[1][1], zz[2][1] etc. ..i would need to increment a variable i and pass it like [i][0], [1][1], [2][1] etc. i would appreciate your assistance to address syntax for this."
