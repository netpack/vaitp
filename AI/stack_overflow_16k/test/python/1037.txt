"blank: have a function call another function with the argument already input is it possible to have a function that calls another function with the argument already input? i'm working on a project and have simplified the problem to the code below. i want to call the function ""test_2"" and have the input equal y then use the input as the argument for ""test_1"". is this allowed with blank's rules or is there another way around this problem?..def test_1(x):.    if x == 1:.        print(""string"")..def test_2():.    y = input().    if y == 1:.        test_1(y)"
