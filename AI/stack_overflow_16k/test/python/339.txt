"how can i stop these variables from resetting while still being able to loop them? here's part of my code:..def dice_game():.     dice_window = tk().     dice_window.geometry('450x450').     player1_score = 0 .     player2_score = 0.     def player1_turn():.         player1_num1 = random.randint(1, 6).         player1_num2 = random.randint(1, 6).         player1_score = player1_num1 + player1_num2.         player1_total = player1_num1 + player1_num2.         if (player1_total % 2) == 0:.             player1_score = player1_score + 10.         else:.             player1_score = player1_score - 5.         player1_result = label(dice_window, text = ( ""player 1 got"", player1_num1, ""and"", player1_num2, ""and their total score is:"", player1_score)).         player1_result.pack().     for x in range(1, 6):.         player1_turn()...i've tried putting the loop inside the player1_turn () function and in the dice_game() function but the outcome is always the same. how can i keep the 2 players score without resetting them every time this section loops 5 times?"
