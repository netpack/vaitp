"iterating through particular rows in a csvfile in blank i have a programming assignment that include csvfiles. so far, i only have a issue with obtaining values from specific rows only, which are the rows that the user wants to look up...when i got frustrated i just appended each column to a separate list, which is very slow (when the list is printed for test) because each column has hundreds of values...question:.the desired rows are the rows whose index[0] == user_input. how can i obtain these particular rows only and ignore the others?"
