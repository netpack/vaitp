"datetime anomaly with abreviated months i cannot fathom what is going in the following example..&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.strptime(""aug 10"", ""%b %y"").datetime.datetime(2010, 8, 1, 0, 0)...makes sense %b is abreviated month name and %y is year so august 2010 corresponds to datetime(2010, 8, 1, 0, 0)..however if i change %y to %m, where %m is day of the month it gets weird..&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.strptime(""aug 10"", ""%b %m"").datetime.datetime(1900, 10, 1, 0, 0)...all of a sudden it refuses to recognize ""aug"""
