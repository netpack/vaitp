"blank: guessing game gone wrong i'm trying to create a small, basic guessing game in blank, something like text twist. here's the code:..while game_running == true:.    if (tries_left != 0):.        print ""tries left: "" + str(tries_left).        chosen_text = text_list[picker(text_length)].        scrambled_text = scrambler(chosen_text).        print ""guess the word/s: "" + scrambled_text.        guess_text = raw_input(""your answer (space included): "").        if (chosen_text == guess_text):.            print ""congratulations! you guessed correctly!"".            game_running = false.        else:.            tries_left-=1.    else:.        print ""lol. you dun goofed son. terminating like skynet..."".        game_running = false...out of sight functions:...picker - basically a randomizer.scrambler - scrambles the words. in progress and not yet implemented....you have 3 tries to guess correctly, or the app terminates. if you guessed correctly, the app displays a message, then terminates. sounds simple enough...the problem:..i could not get this to work:..if (chosen_text == guess_text):...even though i'm 100% sure (via print chosen_text) that i guessed it right...what i tried:..i tried reversing the order, putting str() around them, and even reversing the flow of the if and else, using is instead of ==, and removing the tries function, fwiw...nothing could get it to go true.......unless i hard-code chosen_text, and guess that correctly...am i missing something?"
