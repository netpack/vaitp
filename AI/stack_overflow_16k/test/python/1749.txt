"adding a string with spaces to a stack i'm working on developing a mini-language in blank (not really, just a few commands for a personal project)...here's the code:..class flashcard:.    def __init__(self):.        self.commands = {'addquestion':self.addquestion}.        self.stack = [].        self.questions = {}...    def addquestion(self):.        question = self.stack.pop().        answer = input(question)...    def interpret(self,expression):.        for token in expression.split():.            if token in self.commands:.                operator = self.commands[token].                operator().            else:.                self.stack.append(token)..i = flashcard().i.interpret('testing this addquestion')...the interpret function will only pull the last word (this) from the string. is there a way to make it pull the entire line?..thank you!"
