"attempting to move files but unable to move folders via blank i am trying to move files and folders from directory to another. i am currently facing two issues....it only seems to move files but not any folders..it only picks up the uppercase or lowercase....do you know what might be missing to do this. i could add an or statement statement with startswith but would like to see if there is a better way to do this. ..import os.from os import path.import shutil..src = ""c:/users/test/documents/"".dst = ""c:/users/test/documents/test""..files = [i for i in os.listdir(src) if i.startswith(""c"") and .         path.isfile(path.join(src, i))].for f in files:.    shutil.move(path.join(src, f), dst)"
