"isinstance file blank 2.7 and 3.5 in blank 2.7 i get the following results:..&gt;&gt;&gt; with open(""readme.md"", ""r"") as fin:....     print(isinstance(fin, file)).... .true...in blank 3.5 i get:..&gt;&gt;&gt; with open(""readme.md"", ""r"") as fin:....     print(isinstance(fin, file)).... .traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;.nameerror: name 'file' is not defined...so, ok i look at the blank docs and find out that in blank 3.5, files are of type io.iobase (or some subclass). leading me to this:..&gt;&gt;&gt; import io.&gt;&gt;&gt; with open(""readme.md"", ""r"") as fin:....     print(isinstance(fin, io.iobase)).... .true...but then when i try in blank 2.7:..&gt;&gt;&gt; import io.&gt;&gt;&gt; with open(""readme.md"", ""r"") as fin:....     print(isinstance(fin, io.iobase)).... .false...so at this point, i'm confused. looking at the documentation, i feel as though blank 2.7 should report true...obviously i'm missing something elementary, perhaps because it's 6:30 pm et, but i have two related questions:...why does blank report false for isinstance(fin, io.iobase)?.is there a way to test that a variable is an open file which will work in both blank 2.7 and 3.5?"
