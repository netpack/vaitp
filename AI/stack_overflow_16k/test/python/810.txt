"can i dynamically pass a list of arguments to a blank function with predefined arguments? i have a blank function bar(a=none, b=none, c=none, d=none, e=none). i was wondering if it was possible to build the list of arguments i want to pass in, with a list or a string, or something...i would have a list of attributes to look for and ideally i would simply loop over them and build the argument string...for example, something like:..dict = {'a' : 5, 'c' : 3, 'd' :9} .arg_string = """".for k, v in dict.iteritems():.    arg_string += ""{0}={1},"".format(k, v)..bar(arg_string)...in this case i don't have any values to pass in for b and e, but the next time the program runs there may be...is this possible?..i know the string being built in the for loop will probably be invalid because of the comma at the end. but i didn't think it was necessary to write the handling for that"
