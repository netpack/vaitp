"remove unique values from a list and keep only duplicates i'm looking to run over a list of ids and return a list of any ids that occurred more than once. this was what i set up that is working:..singles = list(ids).duplicates = [].while len(singles) &gt; 0:.    elem = singles.pop().    if elem in singles:.        duplicates.append(elem)...but the ids list is likely to get quite long, and i realistically don't want a while loop predicated on an expensive len call if i can avoid it. (i could go the inelegant route and call len once, then just decrement it every iteration but i'd rather avoid that if i could)."
