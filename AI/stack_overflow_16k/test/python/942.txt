"blank fuzzy matching i have a database with a million rows that i want to match a text field to an excel spreadsheet, however there are very few exact matches. so i've created a word list with a rank based on how popular that word is, ie the more unique the higher the score and the more likely it will match. this works well and as expected. however, it is slow as i'm looping the spreadsheet through the sql cursor and then through a list of words...any suggestions on how to improve the code or even a different approach that gives a similar answer?..wb = xl.load_workbook(in_file, data_only=true).sh = wb['sheet1'].max_row = sh.max_row + 1.max_col = sh.max_column + 1.with open(out_file, 'w', newline='') as file:.    writer = csv.writer(file).    for xl_row in range(2, max_row):.        matched = [].        var = sh.cell(row=xl_row, column=1).value.        count = 0.        cursor.execute(sql).        for sql_row in cursor:.            count += 1.            r = 0.            for word in word_list:.                if word[0] in var.upper() and word[0] in sql_row[1].upper():.                    r += word[1].            if r &gt; 0:.                matched.append([var, sql_row[0], sql_row[1], r]).                sys.stdout.write('r' + str(count)).                sys.stdout.flush()..        matched.sort(key=lambda x: x[3], reverse=true).        max_rtn = 0.        for match in matched:.            max_rtn += 1.            if max_rtn &lt;= 5:.                print(match).                writer.writerow(match)...example data:..word_list =[['inc.', 3], ['incorporated', 3], [inc, 3], ['group', 50], ['orange', 215], ['apple', 344]..data_set_1 = ['apple inc.', 'orange group']..data_set_2 = ['the apple group', 'apple inc', 'orange inc.', 'orange']..in the above example the 'the apple group' matches the same number of words and will probably get a similar levenshtein (fuzzywuzzy) result to both elements in data set 1. but as apple has a higher significance it will match to 'apple inc.' and not 'orange group'. data set 1 is official names, data set 2 is more human data entered."
