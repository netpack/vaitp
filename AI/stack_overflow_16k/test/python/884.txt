"blank - how to subtract a variable by 1 every second? i'm making a countdown clock, and i've got the basics down, but i have trouble trying to have a variable go down 1, every second. so here is an example:..countdowntime = 100...now i want to be able to have this subtracted every second while visible on screen. here is another example:..print countdowntime...so while it is on the screen (or gui), the variable is constantly going down one...also, how could i make a countdown by days?"
