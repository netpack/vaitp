"list of tuples of dictionaries and ints, how to search through each dict i'm working on a project in which i have a list that contains tuples of a dict and an int.  i'm trying to search through each dictionary for a give name but i'm having some trouble...dicts = [ (somedict, 0), (someotherdict, 5)]...before i just had a list of dicts so i could easily search through with ..def search(name):.    for d in reversed(dicts):.        if name in d: return d[name]...but now that i have a list of tuples i'm not quite sure how to search through the dictionaries.  any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.  i'm so confused now."
