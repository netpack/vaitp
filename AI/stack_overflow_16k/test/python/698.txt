"why can't i add arbitrary members to object instances? i just realized that:..class a(object): pass..a = a().a.x = 'whatever'...works (does not raise an error and creates a new x member)...but this:..a = object().a.x = 'whatever'...raises:..attributeerror: 'object' object has no attribute 'x'...while i probably would never use this in real production code, i'm a bit curious about what the reason is for the different behaviors...any hints ?"
