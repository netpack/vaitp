"how do i return locals() and then re-define them in another function? i am trying to do the following;..def a():.    a = ....    b = ....    ....    n = .....    return locals()..def b(**kwargs):.    """"""some function that would assign all keys and values in this function"""""".   print(a).   print(d)..if __name__==""__main__"":.    b(**a())...i have a long list of variables and i would like to do the above instead of doing..def a():.    a = ....    b = ....    ....    n = .....    return a,b,c,d,e ... n..def b(a,b,c,d,e ... n):.   print(a).   print(d)..if __name__==""__main__"":.    a,b,c,d,e ... n = a().    b(a,b,c,d,e,f ... n)...i've tried fiddling around with exec and locals().update(dict) but these haven't worked for me."
