"why is blank geolite always returning la when i have used uk ip address? i tested it with japan and uk sites, just to see if it was accurate to the right country at least and all i get is the same result from the guide below....la america..im using geoip and geolite...so i go online and follow this quick usage guide:.http://blankhosted.org/blank-geoip/.then i hop into my terminal and run the lines of code...and the example shown returns an la based location, as the guide shows...all good so far...so i exit my terminal and open an editor to see if i can write this into a saved .py file that i can run with one command if needed (at least started to anyway) ..i testedit seems that no matter what  i do it returns la america...all i did was write the lines of code into an editor and add print statements to return the info to me...heres the code:..from geoip import geolite2..# ip for google.co.uk .match = geolite2.lookup(""216.58.198.163"").match is not none.print(match.country).print(match.continent).print(match.timezone).print(match.subdivisions)...the code runs alright and returns info at least, but no matter what country ip address for testing i am only getting la america (like the guide showed) ..heres what i get everytime:..us.na.america/los_angeles.frozenset(['ca']).&gt;&gt;&gt;...can anyone tell me why this is happening and how to make it show the correct location please?..note: my method for obtaining the ip's is by opening my bash terminal and simply entering:..$ host www.google.co.uk.google.co.uk has address 216.58.198.163...and:..$ host www.google.co.jp.www.google.jp has address 209.85.202.94"
