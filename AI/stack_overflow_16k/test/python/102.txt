"extract keys from list of dictionnary through function in blank let's say i have a list of dictionnaries call x..if i want to extract the keys and push them into a new list called y :..y = {k for d in x for k in d.keys()}.y = {k for k in chain(*x)}...now i want to do the same operation with a function. as i don't know the name of the list of dict in advance, i was thinking of using *args..def formatting(*args):    .    return {k for d in args for k in d.keys()}..x_list = formatting(x)...but doing this return attributeerror: 'list' object has no attribute 'keys'..when i passing the real variable name in the function, it's working.....what is the correct way of passing list of dict into a function ?"
