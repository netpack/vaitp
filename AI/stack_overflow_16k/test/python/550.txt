"how to make a blank program loop back to a certain line i have the following code and i would like it to jump back to a line if a certain eventuality were to occur:..number_of_10ct = int(input(""how many 10 cent coins would you like to insert? "")).while number_of_10ct &lt; 0:.    number_of_10ct = int(input(""please enter a positive number."")).number_of_20ct = int(input(""how many 20 cent coins would you like to insert? "")).while number_of_20ct &lt; 0:.    number_of_20ct = int(input(""please enter a positive number."")).number_of_50ct = int(input(""how many 50 cent coins would you like to insert? "")).while number_of_50ct &lt; 0:.    number_of_50ct = int(input(""please enter a positive number."")).number_of_100ct = int(input(""how many 1 rand coins would you like to insert? "")).while number_of_100ct &lt; 0:.    number_of_100ct = int(input(""please enter a positive number."")).number_of_200ct = int(input(""how many 2 rand coins would you like to insert? "")).while number_of_200ct &lt; 0:.    number_of_200ct = int(input(""please enter a positive number.""))..number_of_500ct = int(input(""how many 5 rand coins would you like to insert? "")).while number_of_500ct &lt; 0:.    number_of_500ct = int(input(""please enter a positive number.""))..# creating a variable to store the total amount of.# money inserted into the vending machine..change = round(((number_of_10ct * 0.10) +.                (number_of_20ct * 0.20) + .                (number_of_50ct * 0.50) + .                (number_of_100ct * 1.00) +.                (number_of_200ct * 2.00) +.                (number_of_500ct * 5.00)),.               2).# informing the user how much they have entered in total..print(""n"").print ('you have a credit of' ,change, 'zar')..while change &gt; 0:.    customer_choice = input((""what would you like to buy?"".

""))) and allow the user to enter more ""money""...how can i do that?"
