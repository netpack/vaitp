"rounding up the no input to the multiple of 12 and then using it in further calculations in blank okay i am asked to create a blank program  in which the program asks the customers name and the amount of eggs and then print out the summary with name, total price, total no eggs and total no of dozens...for example- if the input for the no of eggs is 13 it should count it as 2 dozens and will cost the customer for 2 dozens. so this what i have done so far...but the problem is the code only works with multiples of 12. so i want it to work with any number like if we input any number it will automatically round up the input for the order...for example if i input 13 it should go to 24 and will count as 2 dozens with the price of two dozens."
