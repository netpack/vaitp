"converting user nickname to formal first name in blank i am trying to mapping users from different systems based on user first and last name in blank. ..one issue is that the first names are in many cases 'nicknames.' .for example, for a user, his first name is 'dave' in one system, and 'david' in another. ..is there any easy way in blank to convert common nicknames like these to their formal counterparts?..thanks!"
