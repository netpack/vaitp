"get file names into list using glob i want to load file names into an array to load images from their paths. this job is done by the solution provided here. my code is something like this..filenames = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, ""*.jpg""))...my filenames are something similar to this pattern..{videono}_{frameno}_{patchno).jpg...for example their names are like this..1_1_1.jpg.1_1_2.jpg.1_1_3.jpg.......10_1_1.jpg.10_1_2.jpg...when i load filenames into filenames array, they are like this..10_1_1.jpg.10_1_2.jpg.......1_1_1.jpg.1_1_2.jpg.1_1_3.jpg...as far as i know this is because the asci code for _ is bigger than 0 and because of that the list of names is not sorted! i must work with the sorted list. can anyone give me a hand here?..edit.please notice that the sorted of these file names.. [""1_1_1.jpg"", ""10_1_3.jpg"", ""1_1_2.jpg"", ""10_1_2.jpg"", ""1_1_3.jpg"", ""1_20_1"", ""1_2_1"", ""1_14_1""]...is similar to this sorted list.. [""1_1_1.jpg"", ""1_1_2.jpg"", ""1_1_3.jpg"", ""1_2_1.jpg"", ""1_14_1"", ""1_20_1"", ""10_1_2.jpg"", ""10_1_3""]"
