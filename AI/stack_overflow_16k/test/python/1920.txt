"extracting data from file inbwetween key words im trying to write a program that extracts data from a text file in between two key words and puts the data into a list of tuples, with the date as a string and the data as an int. i cannot use for loops only while loops..begin step data..2010-01-01,1000..2010-01-02,2000..end step data..needs extracted into this format [('2001-01-01', 12776), ('2001-01-02', 15128)]..i have written this program:..mylist = []..line = open(filename).read()...start = '&lt;begin step data&gt;'.end = '&lt;end step data&gt;'...startpos = line.find(start) + len(start).endpos = line.find(end, startpos).data = line[startpos:endpos].strip("""")..mylist.append(data.split())...but this puts it in a wrong format: [['2001-01-01,12776', '2001-01-02,15128']]..i think i may have the wrong aproach to this and should be using readlines instead of read"
