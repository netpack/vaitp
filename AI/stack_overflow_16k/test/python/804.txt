"how to read html file only within a certain block in blank? i am trying to read an html file only within a specific block (jinja template) in blank. i want to read between {% block content %} and it's corresponding {% endblock %}...i am searching for {{ and {% between the blocks and i want to print the line number and the content of the line where i find the search patterns...i save the file path in a variable and use it to open the file when i need. i use the enumerate function to keep track of the line number...fp = r""&lt;path_to_html_file&gt;""..def scan(line_number, line, flag):.    with open(fp, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:.        for check_line_number, check_line in enumerate(f, 1):.            if check_line_number &gt;= line_number:.                if '{%' in check_line:.                    print(""line number: {}ncontent: {}"".format(check_line_number, check_line))...with open(fp, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:.    for line_number, line in enumerate(f, 1):.        if '{% block content %}' in line:.            flag = 1.            scan(line_number, line, flag)...the issue i am facing is my code prints out all occurrences of {% that are present after {% block content %}, but i want to read till the corresponding {% endblock %}...also, i am not sure where to close the file."
