"is it possible to fit parameters within function containing an integral where the measured quantity is in the upperbound of the integral? i have a function d(z), where d is measured in function of z. d also depends on two parameters omega_lambda and omega_m. the problem is that d contains an integral over z', of which z is the upper bound and omega_lambda and omega_m appear inside the integral (an integral which can only be solved numerically). is there a way to fit omega_lambda and omega_m?..this is a task for my astroparticle physics class where d is the distance and z the redshift of type ia supernovae. the entire function looks like this:..d=(1+z)*h_0*c int_0^z 1/sqrt(omega_lambda+omega_m*(1+z')^3)dz',..where h_0 is the hubble constant and c the speed of light. i was able to load in the data and plot it with uncertainties (i did this using root for blank), but i couldn't immediately find a  fitting tool (neither on the root documentation or the numpy documentation) which seemed to provide an answer to my question."
