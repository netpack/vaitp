"i have two lists. one of variable names one of initial values. i need to combine them so they can be used in function evaluation i have three lists imported from a.csv file variable names, initial values, and constraints...variables = [x1,x2,x3]...and a list of initial values..intialvalues = [1,2,5]...and a third list of constraints..constraints = ['x1+x2', 'x2-x3']...i am looking for a way to break the lists into variables so that the constraints can be evaluated using eval()...edit: example .csv file..varible names,initial values,constraints.x1,1,x1+x2.x2,2,x2-x1.x3,3,x3+x2.,,x1+x3...the column names are obviously discarded while reading."
