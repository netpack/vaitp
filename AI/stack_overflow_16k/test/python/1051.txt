"how to write to a specific position inside a html in blank? i have a large html file and i want to write to a specific position inside the html file, but i do not want to write on the original file that's why i create a copy of it. currently, i have a code that looks like this:..import shutil..shutil.copy2('./file.html', './new_file.html').f = open('new_file.html', 'w') .content = '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;new value&lt;td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;'.# todo: i need to write the above content after the &lt;tbody&gt; tag in html,.# please note that i have just one &lt;tbody&gt; tag in my html file.f.close()...any ideas how to find write the content variable after the tbody tag in my html?"
