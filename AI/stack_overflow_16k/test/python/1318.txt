"how to get first letter commands using blank's cmd? i would like to type ""c"" in my commandline, hit enter and have it run the ""command"" command. this code does what i want, but it does not use cmd. i would like to use cmd:..import sys..def command():.    print(""this is a command"")..def quit():.    print(""goodbye"").    sys.exit()..def take(item=none):.    if item:.        print(""you take %s"" % item).    else:.        print(""what would you like to take?"")..commands = {.'command': command,.'quit': quit,.'take': take,.}..def complete(text, state):.    print(""here is the text: %s and here is the state %s"" % (text, state))..def my_loop():.    while true:.        c = raw_input(""n&gt;"").        if c.strip():.            c = c.split(' ', 1).            for command in commands:.                if command.startswith(c[0]):c[0] = command.            func = commands.get(c[0], none).            if func:.                if len(c) == 1:func().                else:func(c[1]).            else:print(""i don't understand that command"")..my_loop()...here is the same using cmd, but it does not run the ""command"" command when i type ""c"" and hit enter...import sys, cmd..class mcmd(cmd.cmd):.    prompt = 'n&gt;'..    def default(self, arg):.        print(""i do not understand that command. type 'help' for a list of commands"")..    def do_command(self, line):.        print(""this is a command"")..    def do_quit(self, arg):.        print(""see you"").        return true..mcmd().cmdloop()...how can i get the start of the command to trigger the ""command"" or ""quit"" command using cmd?.(""c"", ""co"", ""com"", ""comm""...).all trigger the ""command"" function..i was considering using the new textwrap module, but textwrap has problems being cross-platform..is there any other way to do this?.thank you,"
