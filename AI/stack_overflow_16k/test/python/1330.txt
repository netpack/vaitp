"i am trying to compute the average of one column with respect to another columns' ranges i have a column 'depth' and it is divided into 5 blocks. so depth from 0-500 feet, 500-1,000ft, 1000-1500 ft..etc.i have a corresponding density value in each depth...i need to find the avergae density at each of the 5 depth blocks..| depth | density |.|-------|---------|.| 0     | 3.3     |.| 1     | 3.55    |.| 2     | 3.44    |.| ...   | ...     |.| 500   | 3.2     |"
