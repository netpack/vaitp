"5 most common words in text file blank i have this code to search for the 5 most common words in a text file but i cant use the sort and reverse functions at the end of the program... how would i avoid using them?..words = open('romeo.txt').read().lower().split()...uniques = [].for word in words:.  if word not in uniques:.    uniques.append(word)...counts = [].for unique in uniques:.  count = 0              .  for word in words:     .    if word == unique:   .      count += 1         .  counts.append((count, unique))..counts.sort()            .counts.reverse()         ..for i in range(min(5, len(counts))):.  count, word = counts[i].  print('%s %d' % (word, count))"
