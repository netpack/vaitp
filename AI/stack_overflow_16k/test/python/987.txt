"blank print string alignment i am printing some values in a loop in blank. my current output is as follows:..0  data count:  249   7348   249   4469   2768   261   20   126.1  data count:  288   11   288   48     2284   598   137      408 .2  data count:  808   999   808   2896   32739   138   202   678.3  data count:  140   26   140   2688   8054   884   433      987...what i'd like is for all values in each column to align, despite differing character/number counts in some, to make it easier to read...the pseudo code behind this is as follows:..for i in range(0,3): ..    print i, "" data count: "", count_a, "" "", count_b, "" "", count_c, "" "", count_d, "" "", count_e, "" "", count_f, "" "", count_g, "" "", count_h...thanks in advance everyone!"
