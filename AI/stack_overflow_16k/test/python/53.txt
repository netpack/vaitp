"blank - next bigger number with the same digits - codewars kata - how can i improve it so this kata says:...  you have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and.  returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:..12 ==&gt; 21.513 ==&gt; 531.2017 ==&gt; 2071..  .  if no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:..9 ==&gt; -1.111 ==&gt; -1.531 ==&gt; -1....i wrote a code to it after so many failures despite the exercise being pretty simple. i was wondering if there are ways i could improve my code, and if there are , please point them out, i'm only trying to understand how to think better...def next_bigger(num):.# first i checked it returns -1 if numbers already have descending digits and there's no bigger number. if int("""".join(sorted(str(num), reverse=true))) == num:  .     return -1.# then i converted the number num into a list of strings. num_list= list(str(num)) .# iterated through the num list. starting from the last number and going backwards. for i in range(len(num_list) -1, 0, -1):.       # if one digit is bigger than it's predecessor:.        if num_list[i] &gt; num_list[i-1]:     .            a=num_list[:i]    # slices num_list into 2 lists, a.            b=num_list[i:]    # and b.            break                 .# i think there's a better way to do this next part, but nothing else came into my mind..#     so i made a clone of the second list and sorted it ascendantly.# for the smallest number to be in the first place([0]). b_list_for_min_num=sorted(list(b))   ..# and deleted every minimum number (from the copied b list) that.#was smaller than the last digit in list a through a while loop. while b_list_for_min_num[0] &lt;= a[-1]:    .     del b_list_for_min_num[0]  ..# then swapped the last digit from list a and the minimum digit from the copied b list, but with the digit from the original b list. b[b.index(min(b_list_for_min_num))], a[-1] = a[-1], b[b.index(min(b_list_for_min_num))].# then sorted the changed b list ascendently to make sure it will result exactly the next bigger number. b = sorted(b).# then joined the lists together. finish = a + b.# and turned them into an integer     . result = int(''.join(map(str, finish))).# aaaand returned the result . return result"
