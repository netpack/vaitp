"using a soap wsdl with blank i have been trying to wrap my head around a few things and i havent found a concrete solution for the same. ..i want to use a soap web service to get an xml data and then parse the received xml data. ..so far, i have only found libraries compatible with blank 2.xx and i want something comaptible with blank 3.xx. i have tried zeep but i wasnt able to configure it as its module was released on may 15th. ..anyway, i would like to be guided towards a library which can help me setup a soap client on blank 3.6 allowing me to use its methods to send requests and consume the response."
