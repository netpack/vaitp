"blank - hangman game with multiple letters in one word i am new to blank and have a problem with a hangman game that i was making. so i have a list called ""current"" which is filled with hyphens (-) the same amount of times as the length of the word the person is guessing. when they guess a letter correctly it replaces the hyphen with the letter in the correct place. the problem i have is that if there are 2 or more of the same letter in a word then it works for the first time the letter comes up but after that it will say the letter has already been guessed therefore it doesn't work and i cant figure out how to fix this...current = ""_"" * len(theword).x = list(current).print (x)..guessed = []..while current != theword and lives &gt; 0:..    print (""you have %d lives left"" % lives).    guess = input(""please input one letter or type 'exit' to quit."").    guess = guess.lower()...    if guess == ""exit"":.        break.    elif guess in guessed:..        print (""you have already guessed this letter, please try again."")....    guessed.append(guess)..    if guess in theword:.        index = theword.find(guess).        x = list(current).        x[index] = guess.        current = """".join(x).        print (""correct! nyour guesses: %s"" % (guessed)).        print(x)...    else:.        print (""incorrect, try again"").        lives = lives -1...if current == theword:.    print (""well done, you have won!"")...thanks"
