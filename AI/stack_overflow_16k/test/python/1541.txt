"how to browse the .csv file to perform an operation on it using blank? i have a .csv file (raw report) and i have written a blank script to perform some operations on it...the script is working fine and i am executing this script using terminal...my requirement is: i have mentioned the raw .csv file name in the script to open and perform few operations on it, so can i browse the file, instead of writing the file name in script (because sometimes the file name changes which i want to automate)...""file name is changing randomly"" i don't want to edit my script daily."
