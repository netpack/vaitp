"blank regex find all matches i'm using blank 2.7 re library to find all numbers written in scientific form in a string. i'm using the following code:..import re.y = re.findall("".([0-9]+.[0-9]+[ee][-+]?[0-9]+)."",""{8.25e+07|8.26206e+07}"").print y...however, the output is only ['8.25e+07'] while i'm expecting something like [('8.25e+07'),(8.26206e+07)]. i've been trying around but couldn't find where the problem is. if i input y = re.findall("".([0-9]+.[0-9]+[ee][-+]?[0-9]+)."",""|8.26206e+07}"") then it gives ['8.26206e+07'] so the pattern is matching the second number but i don't get it why it doesn't match both at the same time."
