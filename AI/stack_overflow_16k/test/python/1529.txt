"how to create a program that gives infinite slope? write a program that determines the slope of a line given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). your input should be 4 integer values representing the two points. in the case of any improper slopes, output infinity...this is what i did..x1 = int(input(""enter the value of x1:"")).y1 = int(input(""enter the value of y1:"")).x2 = int(input(""enter the value of x2:"")).y2 = int(input(""enter the value of y2:"")).slope = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).print(slope).if slope is slope/0:.print(infinite).else:.print(slope)"
