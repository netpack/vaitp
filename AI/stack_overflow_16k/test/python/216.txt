"streamlabs chatbot: no module named fcntl i am new at blank and i try to write a script for streamlabs chatbot using interprocess communication. the problem is that the chatbot thows an error when i include the following line to the file:..import multiprocessing...error message: ..""no module named fcntl""...my operation system is windows, and i googled that ""fcntl"" is not available here. however, when i execute the same command from the command line, it works! so i may suggest that the chatbot somehow tries to use unix-libraries instead of the windows ones in some cases..so maybe i have to force the chatbot to use the appropriate libraries, but i don't know how."
