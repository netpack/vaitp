"blank input/output, files i need to write some methods for loading/saving some classes to and from a binary file. however i also want to be able to accept the binary data from other places, such as a binary string...in c++ i could do this by simply making my class methods use std::istream and std::ostream which could be a file, a stringstream, the console, whatever...does blank have a similar input/output class which can be made to represent almost any form of i/o, or at least files and memory?"
