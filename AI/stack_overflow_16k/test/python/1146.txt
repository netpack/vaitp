"how to type negative number with .isdigit? when i try this..if question.isdigit() is true:...i can type in numbers fine, and this would filter out alpha/alphanumeric strings..when i try 's1' and 's' for example, it would go to (else)...problem is, when i put negative number such as -1, '.isdigit' counts '-' sign as string value and it rejects it. how can i make it so that '.isdigit' allows negative symbol '-'?..here is the code. of the thing i tried...while a &lt;=10 + z:.    question = input(""what is "" + str(n1) + str(op) + str(n2) + ""?"").    a = a+1..    if question.lstrip(""-"").isdigit() is true:.        ans = ops[op](n1, n2).        n1 = random.randint(1,9).        n2 = random.randint(1,9).        op = random.choice(list(ops))..        if int(question) is ans:.            count = count + 1.            z = z + 0.            print (""well done"").        else:.            count = count + 0.            z = z + 0.            print (""wrong"").    else:.        count = count + 0.        z = z + 1.        print (""please type in the number"")"
