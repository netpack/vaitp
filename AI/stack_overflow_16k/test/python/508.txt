"blank: 'float' object is not subscriptable i'm trying to map some non numerical values in a pandas dataset that contains information from passengers that were on the titanic. right now i'm trying to map the ports where passengers embarked from. there are 3 ports and i'm trying to map them by adding a column for each port. 0 if they embarked from that port 1 if not...i tried doing something similar with sex. i added another column with a 0 if the sex was male and 1 if the sex was female. that worked, but when i try doing this with the ports i get a ""'float' object is not subscriptable"" error...import pandas as pd.#opening the data.train_path = #path to data set.passengers = pd.read_csv(train_path)..#creating a copy.passengers_copy = passengers..#mapping sex.passengers_copy['sexbin'] = [0 if x[0] == 'm' else 1 for x in passengers_copy['sex']]..#trying to map the first port.passengers_copy['embarkeds'] = [0 if x[0] == 's' else 1 for x in passengers_copy['embarked']]"
