"check if the first list is a sublist of the second one blank i started study blank and i arrive at list and recursion. i saw an exercise. it says write a function that takes two lists as parameters and checks whether the first is a sublist of the second. note that the elements in the lists may be lists themselves. at the beginning i thought it was easy but then i saw that the tricky thing is that my function has to accept nested lists (like [1,2,[3,[4,5]]]) and has to be in recursion. i know how to do it with recursion and with normal lists. i have no idea of how to apply the recursion to the nested lists. can you help me?..el1 = ''.el2 = ''.list1 = [].list2 = [].while el1 != ""exit"":.    el1 = input(""insert the words of the first list: "").    print(""write exit to finish"").    list1.append(el1).while el2 != ""exit"":.    el2 = input(""insert the words of the second list: "").    print(""write exit to finish"").    list2.append(el2).for x in list2:.    if x not in list1:.        print(""false"").        break.    else:.        print(""true"").        break"
