"plotting array of size (n,m,i) as n distinguishable functions on same plot i have a data set that is a 3d array and i wish to plot it. the size of the array is (n,m,i) where n represents the amount of functions to be plotted, m represents the number of points to be plotted for each function and i is the coordinate component (x,y,z) for each point. i wish to plot each function in n in the same 3d plot but make them distinguishable. the only way i could see i could do this is with a for loop. particletrajectorymat is the array of size (n,m,i):..matsize = np.array([particletrajectorymat.shape]).fig = plt.figure().particleplot = fig.add_subplot(111,projection='3d').for plot1 in range(0,matsize[0,0]-1):.    particleplot.plot(particletrajectorymat[0,:,plot1],particletrajectorymat[1,:,plot1],particletrajectorymat[2,:,plot1],'b').particleplot.set_xlabel('x axis').particleplot.set_ylabel('y axis').particleplot.set_zlabel('z axis').particleplot.grid().plt.show()...however, when i plot the points, the plot looks very wrong. i used the same sort of syntax when plotting in matlab so i only can think of this method. what may be wrong with this and is there a better way to do it?"
