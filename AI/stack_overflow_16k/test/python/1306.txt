importing from module after it has been imported in blank i'm curious why the following works:..import pandas as pd.from pandas import dataframe...while the following does not:..import pandas as pd.from pd import dataframe...clearly the interpreter knows that pd is a module as evidenced by type(pd). does it have to do with the fact that from is searching for pd on the path directly rather than using the alias?
