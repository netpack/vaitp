"how to import the module which using argparse i got the module call foo.py, use argparse to handle variables, requires some variables, -a and a element..blank foo.py -a element...this works well, now i get a list of elements, i try to use foo.py to run all of them.so i create a script like this:..import foo.for i in range(len(element)):.# how to run foo and pass -a here?...another option will be use execfile()..execfile(""foo.py"") #should i set the -a as some global variable here?...i follow here argparse module how to add option without any argument?, i don't quite understand how to do this...edit..follow importing a blank script from another script and running it with arguments, now i can run the script well, but any better solution than add a list to sys.args? or i have to add the element first, after the main() finish, than delete it from sys.args and over and over again."
