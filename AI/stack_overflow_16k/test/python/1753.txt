undefined variables from input in pydev project i use liclipse as my blank ide. i imported two given skeletons in order to extend them (my first blank project). i created a pydev project and dragged and dropped the files beneath the root of the project. the .py file declares the following import statements:..import cv2.import numpy as np.import math...every use of cv2 or np results in an undefined variable from input. is this question identical to how do i fix pydev &quot;undefined variable from import&quot; errors? (with a proposed solution of just ignoring the error in the ide) or did i forget some settings?
