detecting a keypress in blank while in the background i am trying to find a way to detect a keypress and then run a method depending on what key it is.  ..i can already do this with tkinter.  but what i can't do is detect the keypress while the window is in the background.  i will be running this program in the background while i play a game.  i need it to be able to detect inputs while i'm in the game.  ..is there any way i can do this with tkinter or something else?  preferably i would like to not have to download anything external as i would like to distribute this to some other people.
