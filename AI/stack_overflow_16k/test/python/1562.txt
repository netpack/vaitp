"whats wrong with my blank script? does not print variable working through a blank tutorial. i created a simple script (myfirstfunction) that does not perform whats expected..i expected a line of output that is just two variables multiplied together:..apples = raw_input(""how many apples do you have?"").oranges = raw_input(""how many oranges do you have?"")..def myfirstfunction(apples, oranges):.    total_fruit = apples * oranges.    print total_fruit...the script does ask for the inputs as expected, but does not print out the results?..myname-macbook:blankhard me$ blank ex19b.py.how many apples do you have?2.how many oranges do you have?2.mynames-macbook:blankhard me$ ...why does it not print out 4?"
