"pipy - any resource (website/script etc) to find popularity metric for a user to identify a relevant package i wish to identify the ""most appropriate"" blank library to use for my problem. i have encountered this task/requirement so many times that i thought that perhaps i can ask it here...let's say i wish to implement a ""kalman filter"" (a popular computational routine across disciplines) in my application and naturally, use existing professional libraries. one metric/criterion i like to know about before investing a whole lot of time (reading documentation etc.) is some measure of it's popularity index by the community. (maybe a rating like github stars, or download count like what mathworks' fileexchange website provides).)..the search string ""kalman filter"" on pypi yielded about 15 results, leading much confusion to which one should i invest my time on...is there a way (maybe a blank/shell script?) available to obtain some insight into a package/library's peer-review/quality/download stats from the blank package archive https://pypi.blank.org based on a user's search string?"
