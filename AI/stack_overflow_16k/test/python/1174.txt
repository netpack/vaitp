"blank dynamic class object names just a quick question. i've tried googling this but every time you add ""class"" to a blank search it gives you classes on blank. d:..i've found threads like this: how can you dynamically create variables via a while loop?..but i don't think that's exactly what i'm looking for since concatenation is also part of the variable...here's my while loop:..def main():.    counter = 1.    while counter &lt;= 3:.        print ""name: "",employee[counter].name.        print ""id number: "",employee[counter].id_number.        print ""department: "",employee[counter].department.        print ""job title: "",employee[counter].job_title.        print #lb.        counter = counter + 1..main()  ...i have my objects set up as:..employee1 = employee(""susan meyers"", 47899, ""accounting"", ""vice president"").employee2 = employee(""mark jones"", 39119, ""it"", ""programmer"").employee3 = employee(""joy rogers"", 81774, ""manufacturing"", ""engineer"")...this is the error i receive:..print ""name: "",employee[counter].name.nameerror: global name 'employee' is not defined...obviously i have a class set up as well, but i don't think i need to paste that for this. what i want it to do is go through the loop and change the counter from 1 to 2 to 3. that way it'll loop through all three employees. ..is it possible to do that? i've only ever done this with arrays so i'm not 100% sure i'm on the right track...any tips would be great. &lt;3..chelsea"
