"how to call various strings without using %s? text1=""blank"".text2=""with me"".print(""study %(language)s"" %{'language':text1})....this works. but i am wondering whether it is using dictionary to call string? ...print(""study %(language)s %(with whom)"" %({'language':text1},{'with whom':text2}))...but it doesn't work. how can i fix it?...the error says 'format requires a mapping'"
