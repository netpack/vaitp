"typeerror: object of type 'builtin_function_or_method' has no len() i am attempting to create a hangman game in blank. i have the words which i will be using for the game in a txt file and i wish to read this file line by line and append the contents to a list for use; however i am encountering this typeerror. (object of type 'builtin_function_or_method' has no len())..try:.    f = open(input(""enter a filename: "")).except:.    print(""cannot open file"").    quit()..mylist = [].myline = f.readline().print(myline).print(len(myline))..while len(myline) &gt;0 :.    mylist.append(myline).    myline = f.readline...the error is regarding..while len(myline) &gt;0 :...this is confusing me a lot as the calls to print(myline) and print(len(myline)) immediately above are working correctly, outputting the contents of the line and its length; it is only when i enter the while loop that i am getting this error...any help would be greatly appreciated, .many thanks."
