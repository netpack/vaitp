"blank script for run time log seggregation i have a requirement of reading the log file in run time and segregate them in to multiple different files based on the search...since the log file will be rotated on a daily basis i have used ""getmtime"" to read the latest modified log file and read the lines dynamically as it is updated in the log and segregate them in to multiple files...however my code fails to read new lines in the log file. request your inputs here...import time.import os.import glob..newest = max(glob.iglob('/var/log/*.log'), key=os.path.getmtime)..with open(newest,'r') as file, .open(‘result1.log’, ‘w’) as output_file1, .open(‘result2.log’, ‘w’) as output_file2, .open(‘result3.log’, ‘w’) as output_file3:...    while 1:..        where = file.tell().        line = file.readline()..        if not line:..           time.sleep(1)..           file.seek(where)..        else:..             if “abc” in line:..                 output_file1.write(line)..             if “def” in line:..                 output_file2.write(line)..             if “ghi” in line:..                 output-file3.write(line)..         newest1 = max(glob.iglob('/var/log/*.log'), key=os.path.getmtime)..         if newest1 != newest..             newest= newest1..             file = open(newest, 'r')...thanks &amp; reagrds,.ankith"
