"what is 'is' in blank? my understanding of ""is"" is that it checks if the two operands point to the same structure..i am unsure why this is true ..x = 1.y = 1.y is x...and why this is false..l1 = [1,2,3].l2 = [1,2,3].l1 is l2...similarly, why is the first not false as well? is it saying that when i initialize x, it creates the object with int value ""1"", and from now on, whenever i initialize variables to have ""1"", it will point to the first object.  ..if so, i am curious why its not the same with the second example."
