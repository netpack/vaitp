global variable and import let's consider a file called test1.py and containing the following code:..def init_foo():.    global foo .    foo=10...let's consider another file called test2.py and containing the following:..import test1..test1.init_foo().print(foo)...provided that test1 is on the blankpath (and gets imported correctly) i will now receive the following error message:..nameerror: name 'foo' is not defined..anyone can explain to me why the variable foo is not declared as a global in the scope of test2.py while it is run? also if you can provide a workaround for that problem?..thx!
