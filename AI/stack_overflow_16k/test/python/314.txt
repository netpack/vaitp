"import function from module without losing module identifier i'm looking for a way to import a single function from a module, without losing the module name from the function name. as an example, ..from os import remove...leaves me with a function called 'remove'; it's not clear, elsewhere in the code, that it comes from the os module. however, this throws a syntax error:..from os import remove as os.remove...this is almost satisfactory (and possible):..from os import remove as os_remove...but again it's not completely clear that this comes from the os module; it would be lovely to keep the dot in if possible..why do i want to do this? well, here are the premises which led me to investigate this - if anyone can tell me that any of these are flawed that would be an excellent thing to learn in itself:...if you're only going to use one function from a module, it's more efficient to only import this than import the whole module..if using, say, os.remove in your code, it's clearer for it to be labelled as such, so it's transparent to everyone else exactly what this function is and how it will behave. of course, this will be discernable from the import statement, but seems like it would be useful throughout the code....if this isn't possible, i'd be interested to learn what stops it."
