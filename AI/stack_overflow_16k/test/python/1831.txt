"encode array to uint8 and then back i have an array which has intensity values from -3000 to 1000,i have thresholded all values which are less then -100 to -100 and all values greater than 400 to 400,after which i convert it to datatype np.uint8,which makes all the values in the array to have intensity values from 0 to 255,..what i am confused about is,is there an operation i can run which will give the array from 0-255 intensity range to the earlier one -100 to 400?..any suggestions will be useful,thanks in advance"
