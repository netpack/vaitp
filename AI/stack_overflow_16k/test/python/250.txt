"blank search path for data files (non-modules) - text files (*txt) base on http://docs.blank.org/release/1.5.1p1/tut/searchpath.html..search path (sys.path)..a list of strings that specifies the search path for modules. initialized from the environment variable blankpath, plus an installation-dependent default....its a path to search for modules in import statements...i am wondering which path is used for search for data files (*txt files etc). for eg. if i do a fs.open(somefile), which all paths blank will search for it?..is it sys.path itself or ?..my confusion is that the docs say sys.path is a search path for modules and data files are not modules."
