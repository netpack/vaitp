"how to check height and width of drawn rectangle blank i am a student just beginning with blank and i am using jes. what my program does is draw the given amount of rectangles in the parameter with a random random height and width within the given parameter ""maxsize"", everything is working smoothly however i am trying to check the amount of squares drawn, how can i check to see if the height and width are the same? should i have used range to create a list instead of using randint? very confused how i can go about checking the width and height and storing each number in a variable to see if they equal eachother. sorry if i sound unclear. ....def partb(width,height,numrectangle,maxsize):.    pic = makeemptypicture(width,height,black)  .    drawn = 0.    numsquares = 0  .    while drawn &lt; numrectangle:.        from random import randint.        import random.        randomx = randint(0,width).        randomy = randint(0,height).        randomsize = randint (0,maxsize).        widthrect = randomsize.        heightrect = randomsize .        addrectfilled(pic,randomx,randomy,widthrect,heightrect,red).        if widthrect == heightrect:.            numsquares+=1.        drawn+=1.    show (pic)"
