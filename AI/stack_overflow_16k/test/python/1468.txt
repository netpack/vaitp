"reading in a semicolon delimited txt file in blank i'm trying to read a .txt file on blank, line by line...out=open('output_patha.txt','w')..with open('input_pathb.txt','r') as foo:.    for each_line in foo:.        #modify each line...one problem is that i want each line to be defined by semi-colon delimiters instead of line change. how would i do that?..this is what the txt file looks like, for instance:..%if (&amp;year lt 2010) %then %do;..  paylc3=(1.08**(1/12)-1)*x1617;..  if (x1918&gt;0) then payore3=.    (x1903 in (12,14,21,22,25,40,41,42,43,44,49,50,52,999))*.    x1918*(%mconv(f=x1919))*(x1905/10000);    .  else if (x1923&gt;0) then payore3=.    (x1903 in (12,14,21,22,25,40,41,42,43,44,49,50,52,999))*.    x1923*(%mconv(f=x1924))*(x1905/10000);.  else payore3=0;.%end;...i want to be able to set each_line as a semi-colon delimited line. thank you in advance."
