"tick blank instances from blank i am interrested in doing a programming game using blank, and i would like to do it in the style of guntactyx (http://apocalyx.sourceforge.net/guntactyx/index.php). only much simpler, as i am primarily interrested in the parallel execution of blank scripts from blank...gun tactyx challenges the player to write a program that controls individual units working together in teams, where each instruction carries a time panalty. each program is executed in its own protected environment, communicating with the game world through functions that can interact with the game world...i was wondering if there is a blank way of achieving similar effect. ..pseudo code structure of the game engine would be something like:..instantiate units with individual programs.while 1.   update game world.   for unit in units:.      unit.tick()...the simulation would run until a timeout or some goal condition...kind regards../tax"
