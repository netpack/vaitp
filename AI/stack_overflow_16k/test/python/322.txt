blank matrices code meaning snippet i was wondering what the for lines in this code are supposed to do. this is a snippet of code i need help with:..# iterate through rows of x.for i in range(len(x)):.   # iterate through columns of y.   for j in range(len(y[0])):.       # iterate through rows of y.       for k in range(len(y)):.           result[i][j] += x[i][k] * y[k][j]..for r in result:.   print(r)
