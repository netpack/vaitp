"data of 1 folder gets added to another i have a small script which checks if my object is present in image or not. if present then it writes the image to a folder.there are multiple sub-folders inside.on writing, the data for 1st folder works fine but when data is written to the 2nd sub-folder then the data of 1st folder is also appended along-with the data of 2nd folder..the code works perfectly fine except the problem that while writing the data to disk the data of 1st sub-folder is also appended to the data of 2nd sub-folder. below is my code..def target_non_target(input_frames_folder,model_file,output):..    if not os.path.exists(output):.        os.makedirs(output,exist_ok=true)..    count=0.    folders = glob(input_frames_folder)..    img_list = []...    for folder in folders:.        folder_name=os.path.basename(folder).        #print(folder_name).        out_path = output +""\"" + folder_name.        print(out_path).        os.makedirs(out_path,exist_ok=true)....        for f in glob(folder+""/*.jpg""):.            img_list.append(f)..        for i in range(len(img_list)):.            v1=os.path.basename(img_list[i]).            img_name = os.path.splitext(v1)[0].            image = cv2.imread(img_list[i]).            orig = image.copy()..            image = cv2.resize(image, (28, 28)).            image = image.astype(""float"") / 255.0.            image = img_to_array(image).            image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)...            print(""[info] loading network..."").            model = load_model(model_file)...            (non_target, target) = model.predict(image)[0]..            if target &gt; non_target:.                label = ""target""..            else:.                label = ""non target""..            probab = target if target &gt; non_target else non_target.            label = ""{}: {:.2f}%"".format(label, probab * 100)...            op = imutils.resize(orig, width=400).            cv2.puttext(op, label, (10, 25),  cv2.font_hershey_simplex,0.7, (0, 255, 0), 2)..            if target &gt; non_target:.                cv2.imwrite(out_path+""/""+""\{}.jpg"".format(img_name),orig).            cv2.waitkey(0)..    #return target_op...frames_folder = (""c:\blank36\videos\videos_new\*"")..model = (""c:\blank35\target_non_target\target_non_target.model"")..output_folder = (""c:\blank35\target_non_target\target_images_new\"")..target_check = target_non_target(frames_folder,model,output_folder)...suppose there are 2 sub-folders a and b inside a main folder x.there will be many more sub-folders.while writing output to disk the data of a is written perfectly but while writing data for b the data of folder a and folder b both are getting appended into b folder. i want the data to be in their respective folders. any idea what changes could be made in my script for getting the desired output"
