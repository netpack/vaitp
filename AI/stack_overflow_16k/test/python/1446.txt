"blank - how to insert blank line at certain directory level when doing directory walk? i know how to do a directory walk (using os.walk) and print out all files in a certain directory.  what i want to do further is to insert a blank line after the contents of a directory are printed for all directories at a certain level.  to illustrate, suppose i have these files:../level1/level2a/file1.txt./level1/level2a/level3a/file2.txt./level1/level2a/level3b/levle4/file3.txt./level1/level2b/file4.txt./level1/level2b/file5.txt...i want to print them as:../level1/level2a/file1.txt./level1/level2a/level3a/file2.txt./level1/level2a/level3b/levle4/file3.txt../level1/level2b/file4.txt./level1/level2b/file5.txt...notice there is a blank line separating the listings of level2a and level2b (but no blank line between level3a and level3b).  i want the listings of each directory at level2 (i.e.e 2 levels down from root) to be separated by blanks.  how to do this in blank?..p.s. the listing will be quite large so i don't want to do this by hand.  also, the script needs to be flexible so if requirement changes to insert blank lines at level 3 (instead of level 2) it needs to be able to handle that."
