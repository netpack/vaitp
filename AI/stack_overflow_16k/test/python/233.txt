"tell position of string in document this code works to print the line number which contains the given string:..import os..f = open('document.xml', 'r+')..for (i, line) in enumerate(f, start=1):.    if ""&lt;w:t&gt;omg"" in line: print(i)...but i want to know how much characters are in the document before the string starts. so i thought being a smartass and changed it to this:..import os..f = open('document.xml', 'r+')..for (i, line) in enumerate(f, start=1):.    if ""&lt;w:t&gt;omg"" in line: print(f.tell())...but this throws an error:..if ""&lt;w:t&gt;omg"" in line: print(f.tell())..oserror: telling position disabled by next() call...i can not use the line number for what i want to do, because it has to work with generated xml documents, without newlines, too."
