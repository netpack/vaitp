"data hiding in blank class i know that the attributes of class which are declared by double underscore __ prefix may or may not visible outside the class definition. as we can still access those attributes by object._classname__attrname...class a:.    def __init__(self):.        self.a = 1.        self.b = 2.        ----.        ----.        self.z = 26.        self.catch = 100...now to protect all attributes except the attribute catch, i have to declare them with double underscore which is quite messy. is there a way i can say in my class definition that only self.catch can be accessed outside the class?..apologies if this is answered somewhere else or discussed earlier."
