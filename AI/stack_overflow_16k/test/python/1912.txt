"how to check if any item exists in the list how to check whether a list and an element of a list with such an index exist in the list itself?.. i have a list [[10,10,9], [10,10,10], [10,10,10]]...then i enter the number of coordinates (k) and the coordinates themselves. at these coordinates, i have to subtract 8 from the cell and 4 with each cell standing next to it. but what if there are no cells nearby?.when checking if field [r + f] [c + s] in field: it always gives a negative answer. how to make a check?..for i in range(k):.    for j in range(1):.        f = drops[i][j].        s = drops[i][j + 1].        field[f][s] -= 8.        for r in range(-1, 1):.            for c in range(-1, 1):.                if not (r == c == 1):.                    if field[r + f][c + s] in field:.                        field[r + f][c + s] -= 4"
