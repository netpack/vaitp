"one liner for iterating through two lists and removing item from one if exists in the other have two lists:..one = ['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd', 'eee'].two = ['aaa', 'qqq', 'rrr', 'bbb', 'zzz']...currently i searched through both and if one exists in the other it is removed like so:..for i in one:.    for j in two:.        if j in i:.            one.remove(i)...this returns ..a = ['ccc', 'ddd', 'eee']...just wondering if there's a more blankic way of doing it than how i currently am?"
