"finding connection between data suppose i have a set of points x=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n), each point x_i=(a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i, e_i, f_i, g_i, h_i)...there should be some fixed connection between values on different axis of x_i. ..for example  ..the connection could be a_i*h_i=d_i*e_i=b_i*g_i=c_i*f_i but this relationship is unknown a priori. is there a blank module for finding this kind of relationship between data ? x_i comes from a very accurate measurement but might not be exactly accurate and the number of measurements 'n' can be as large as i want."
