"first blank program, ""lotto prediction"" i am new to blank and trying to learn it quickly by messing around.  so i decided to make a lotto program.  its pick 3, numbers 0-9, choose three numbers from 0-0-0 to 9-9-9. i would like to add all numbers that has been called in the past to a variable or tuple. this variable or tuple is checked before printing results.  this is what i got so far...    import random.    items = range (10).    random.sample([items]), 3.    [4, 0, 2]    # result...how do i setup a variable with the numbers results of past draw and print results based on most called?..any help would be appreciated...thanks"
