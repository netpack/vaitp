"fitting the curve on the gaussian what is the problem on my code for fitting the curve?..i've written some code for fitting my data based on gaussian distribution. however, i got some wrong value of a, b, c defined at the beginning of the code. could you give me some advice to fix that problem?..from numpy import *.from scipy.optimize import curve_fit..def func(x, a, b, c):.    return a*exp(-(x-b)**2/(2*c**2)).file = loadtxt(""angdist1.xvg"", skiprows = 18, dtype = float).x = [].y = [].for i in range(shape(file)[0]):.    x.append(file[i,0]).    y.append(file[i,1])..popt, pcov = curve_fit(func, x, y)..plt.plot(x, func(x, *popt), color = 'red', linewidth=2).plt.legend(['original','fitting'], loc=0).plt.show()"
