"how can i create a loop in my program to make it run at the end of each user option in blank? here is my code:-..f= open(""passes.py"", ""a+"").m=open(""money.py"",""a+"").passes= {}.init={}.initial=0.import time.print ""welcome to the virtual banking system"".user=raw_input(""would you like to create a new account?
