"blank program for finding triangular number with more than 500 divisors i have tried to solve a problem to find first triangular number with more than 500 divisors but there is overflow error..please give a better way..question is..the sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. so the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. the first ten terms would be:..1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66 .....let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:.1: 1.3: 1,3.6: 1,2,3,6.10: 1,2,5,10.15: 1,3,5,15.21: 1,3,7,21.28: 1,2,4,7,14,28.we can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors..what is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?..my program is..`.def isprime(a):.    m=0.    for j in range(1,a/2+1):.        if (a%j)==0:.            m+=1.    return m+1.i=1.n=1.div=500.while (i&gt;=1):.    l=isprime(i).    ans=i.    if l&gt;div:.        print ans.        break.    n+=1.    i=n*(n+1)/2.`"
