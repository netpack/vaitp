"how can i find the position of one element in a sentence compared to a same element? this sounds very strange, let me explain. i would like to know how i can find the positions of a word if it is shared by two different lists in blank. for example:..a =[i,am,using,the,internet].b =[are,you,using,a,desktop]...it should be able to tell me positions 2 (from the first list, it just happens that's the position of it in both if them). i can see if any words are shared but i don't know how to find the position:..if any(x in a for x in b):...yet i cannot get this line to tell me the position of it. i know this is incredible simple, my friend is teaching me how to code."
