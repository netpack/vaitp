blank changing a small part of the function the purpose of this function is to encrypt and decrypt a text message:..def program(str):.    i = 0.    message = [].    while i &lt; len(str):.        message.append(ord(str[i])).        i += 1.    print(message).program (text)...is it possible to change the ord() call so i do not have to create a completely new function? sort of like the str where i can re-enter a new string every single time i run the function.
