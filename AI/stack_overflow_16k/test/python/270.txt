"subtract boolean from float in blank anyways when debuging my code i found statement that basically subtracted boolean from float...then i tried following in blank console: ..&gt;&gt;&gt; 15.0 - true .14.0.&gt;&gt;&gt; 15.0 - false.15.0...can anyone explain to me: ...why subtracting booleans from numeric types is legal (the docs only state that you can do and, not and or on boolean values: http://docs.blank.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not).has this any practical use?"
