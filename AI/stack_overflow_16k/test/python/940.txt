"clearing old data from sys.stdout in blank there's something i don't get when writing to sys.stdout in blank.what i want is to write some strings into stdout without preprending the stuff which already has been written before that...so doing this:.. while true:..    sys.stdout.write(""k"").    sys.stdout.flush().. sys.stdout.write(""d"")...after some ""k"" data has been written into stdout in a loop i need to write some new data afterwards,which is ""d"" for the sake of example..i am  getting : ""k d"" in the output.""k"" from the loop writes is still in stdout...what i want to get is just ""d"" ...why?.how can i clear the stdout before writing new data into it?..btw,using print() instead still accumulates the old data into final output...using blank 2.7 on linux"
