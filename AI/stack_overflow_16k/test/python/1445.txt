"definition of a function that does nothing i need to define a function depending on a condition, so that it either does something or nothing...e.g...# code block that *defines* bar.if condition:.  bar = do_stuff.else:.  bar = # ?.# end of the definition of bar..bar()...do_stuff is a function defined somewhere else that does some useful computation. i want bar() to do be defined to do nothing if the condition above is not met. any ideas?..note: i designed the if-else block above for illustration purposes. i know that i could just call do_stuff() in the if body and pass in the else body. the code above is just to illustrate a code block after which i need bar to be defined either to do something or to do nothing. the block just defines the function and is not meant to call it."
