"how can i make prevent the code from crashing when the user inputs nothing in the function when i use the function, def problem1_5(age), and instead of inputting a value for age, i run the code, it crashes. how can i improve the code so when i dont input any value for age, it doesn't crash ..this is for an online course i am undertaking, and i've already tried putting in a if at the beginning of the code statement but it could be possible that i did it inaccurately...def problem1_5(age):.    if age &lt; 7:.        print (""have a glass of milk"").    elif age &lt; 21:.        print (""have a coke"").    else:.        print (""have a martini"")...i expect, when i enter nothing, to take me to another line or maybe end the code, but it just crashes."
