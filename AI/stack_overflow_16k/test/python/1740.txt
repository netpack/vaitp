"resetting time.clock() in blank start = time.clock().while true:.  elapsed = (time.clock() - start).  if elapsed &gt; 10:.    print(""motion"").    elapsed = 0...i start a timer, calculate elapsed time, and if 10 seconds have passed, i display ""motion"" and then reset elapsed to 0 so ""motion"" only displays every 10 seconds.  for some reason, it doesn't work: motion does initially get displayed after 10 seconds, but after that, it keeps getting displayed on every iteration..what did i do wrong?"
