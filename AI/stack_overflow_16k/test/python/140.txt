"replace all non-alphanumeric characters in a string i have a string with which i want to replace any character that isn't a standard character or number such as (a-z or 0-9) with an asterisk. for example, ""h^&amp;ell`.,|o w]{+orld"" is replaced with ""h*ell*o*w*orld"". note that multiple characters such as ""^&amp;"" get replaced with one asterisk. how would i go about doing this?"
