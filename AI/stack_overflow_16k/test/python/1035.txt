"printing list by element with mapping via a list of lists i have a table represented in the form of a list of list:..table = [[1, 9695],[2, 4755],[6,447]]...and another list containing the values of the second column of the table above where the numbers are in ascending order...lst = [447,4755,9695]...i'm trying to print the values in lst since it's already in ascending order but instead of just printing out the values as such:..447.4755.9695...i want to also have the values at the first column of the table printed together with it:..no: 6  total distance travelled: 447.no: 2  total distance travelled: 4755.no: 1  total distance travelled: 9695...i've tried something like:..n = len(lst).for i in range(n):.    if table[i][1] == lst[i]:    .        print(""no: "" + str(table[i][0]) + "" "" + ""total distance  .        travelled: "" + str(lst[i]))...but it's only printing out certain values but not all of them. i would appreciate some help on this. note that i'm not advised to use any built in functions such as lambda and so on but just something similar as what i've wrote."
