"difference of consecutive float numbers in a column i have a list of floating point numbers in a file in column like this:..123.456..234.567..345.678..how can i generate an output file which is generated by subtracting the value in a line with the value just above it. for the input file above,the output generated should be:..123.456-123.456..234.567-123.456..345.678-234.567..the first value should return zero, but the other values should get subtracted with the value just above it. this is not an homework question. this is a small requirement of my bigger problem and i am stuck at this point. help much appreciated. thanks !!"
