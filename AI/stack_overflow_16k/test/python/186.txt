"calling a variable from one function to the other (blank) i'll start by saying that i did look up answers to this question and unfortunately, i just couldn't understand them or they didn't seem to work for me. this is of course down to me rather than the people who answered the question, so i do apologise in advance...so pretty much i'm trying to call a variable that is assigned by the user from one function to the other, i'll give an example:..def function_one():.    a = input(""what is your name?"").    return a.def function_two():.    print(""nice to meet you, ""a)..function_one().function_two()...this of course does not work and i'm sure that is down to my own stupidity, i wasn't sure why at first because i saw other people saying to simply return the variable, which i did!..i also tried calling the variable from the other function, for example:..def function_two().    a = function_one()...but i realised that was pretty stupid since i'm just assigning that function  as a, so it's not going to work...i'd appreciate some insight, i know these are not the kind of questions you'd expect but yeah... i'm clueless."
