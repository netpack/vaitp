"blank: ending line every n characters when writing to text file i am reading the webpage at ""https://google.com"" and writing as a string to a notepad file.  in the notepad file, i want to break and make a newline every n characters while writing, so that i don't have to scroll horizontally in notepad.  i have looked up a number of solutions but none of them do this so far.  thanks for any suggestions...import urllib.request..page = urllib.request.urlopen(""http://www.google.com"").webfile = page.readlines()..with open(""file01.txt"", 'w') as f:.   for line in webfile:.       f.write(str(line))..f.close()"
