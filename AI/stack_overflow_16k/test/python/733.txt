"how to replace the txt file in a directory there is directory a, which contains several subdirectories of txt files. there is another directory b, which contains txt files. there are several txt files in a that have the same name in b but different content. now i want to move the txt files in b to a and cover the files with the same name. my code is as below:.. import shutil. import os. src = '/path/to/b'. dst = '/path/to/a'. file_list = [].. for filename in os.walk(dst):.    file_list.append(filename).. for root, dirs, files in os.walk(src):.    for file in files:..        if file in file_list:.            ##os.remove(dst/file[:-4] + '.txt').            shutil.move(os.path.join(src,file),os.path.join(dst,file))...but when i run this, it did nothing. can anyone help me about it?"
