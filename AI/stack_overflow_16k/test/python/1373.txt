"making sure that a script does not modify files in specific folder i'm writing a blank script which copies files from a server, performs a few operations on them, and delete the files locally after processing..the script is not supposed to modify the files on the server in any way...however, since bugs may occur, i would like to make sure that i'm not modifyingdeleting the original server files...is there a way to prevent a blank script from having writing permissions to a specific folder? i work on windows os."
