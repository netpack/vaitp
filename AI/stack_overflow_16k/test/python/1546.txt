"why can't i make this number an integer? i need to compare 2 values: the first variable in a list and the user's input. the user's input is already an integer but the code won't let me convert the other value into integer form. ..i've tried ""int"", ""float"" and ""complex"" just to see, but without success. ..here's my code: ..stock = open(""stock.txt"",""r"").next = false.print(""products avaliable are: "").for loop in range (10):.    stockproduct = stock.readline().    product = stockproduct.split(""t"").    print(product[0] , product[1]).while next != true:.    userproduct = int(input(""which product did you buy? "")).    amount = int(input(""how many did you buy? "")).    for loop in range (10):.        stockproduct = stock.readline().        product = stockproduct.split(""t"").        productone = product[0]..        if userproduct == int(productone) :.            user2 == product.            print(user2).            next = true.        else:.           userproduct = int(input("" 2 which product did you buy? "")).         #   amount = int(input(""2 how many did you buy? ""))...and the output is:..traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""c:usersuserdocumentstask 3.py"", line 20, in &lt;module&gt;.    if userproduct == int(productone) :.valueerror: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''.&gt;&gt;&gt; ...this is for a controlled assessment at school."
