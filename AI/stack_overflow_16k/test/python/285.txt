"output list to variable sized formatted string i'm trying to write a function that can take a list and turn it into a string where each value is line seperated...i've tried using string multiplication with formatting..d = [""one"", ""two"", ""three""]..dstring = (""{}n""*(len(d)-1)).format(d)..print(dstring)...my intended result is that a set of braces would be generated per element in the list and could then be formatted with just the list...so it would return..one.two.three...and any other elements in that format should the list get bigger...but instead it returns..indexerror: tuple index out of range"
