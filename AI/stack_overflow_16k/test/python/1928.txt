"function to generate array of numbers that sum up to inputed number i know this seems silly but i need to create a function generate_sum_array(seed,factor) that will create an array of any number of elements arranged in random order  in which all the array elements sum up to seed and have each have element is divisible by factor.for example:.generate_sum_array(100.10).should return something like.[20,10,40,10,20]  or [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10] or  [50,20,10,20,] etc.  as long as the sum of all the elements is 100 the seed.there can be unlimited possibilities (i think.....i am not really sure....how many different arrays can be generated)"
