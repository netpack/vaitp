"blank read file by line and write into a different file so basically what i am trying to do is that i am trying to make it so i can read a file line by line, and then have a certain text added after the text displayed..for ex...code:..file = open(""testlist.txt"",'w').file2 = open(""testerlist.txt"",'r+')..//this gives me a syntax error obviously...file.write1("""" + file + """" + file2 + """")...textlist..in my testlist.txt it lists as:...  os...testerlist..in my testerlist.txt it lists as:...  010101...i am trying to copy one text from one file and read another file and add it to the beginning of a new file for ex.[accounts.txt]...my end result..for my end result i am trying to have it be like:...  os010101...(btw i have all the correct code, its just that i am using this as an example so if i am missing any values its just because i was to lazy to add it.)"
