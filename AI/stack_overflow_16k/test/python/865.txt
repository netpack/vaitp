"reading lines from text file and deleting them each time the script is run i would like to read one line at a time and assigning that string to a variable in my blank script. once this value is assigned i would like to delete that line from the txt file. just now i have the next code:..import os..# open file with a bunch of keywords.inputkeywordsfile = open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'keyworddatabase.txt'),'r')..# assigning.keyword = inputkeywordsfile.readline().strip()...so for example if the .txt file has this structure:..dog.cat.horse...the first time i run my script, dog will be assigned to keyword..the second time i run my script, cat will be assigned to keyword and dog will be deleted from the text file...solved:..readkeywordsfile = open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'keyworddatabase.txt'),'r').firstline = readkeywordsfile.readline().strip().lines = readkeywordsfile.readlines().readkeywordsfile.close()..del lines[0:1]..writekeywordsfile = open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'keyworddatabase.txt'),'w').writekeywordsfile.writelines(lines).writekeywordsfile.close()..keyword = firstline"
