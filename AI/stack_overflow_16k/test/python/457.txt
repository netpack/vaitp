"blank forloop only returning last line below is my current code. it's supposed to read in a file, compare the regex and see if the input from the text file is a correct ipv4 address or not. it is working correctly, however only returning the output for the last line of the input file. for example, if the input file looks like:.. 10.0.0.0. 255.255.255.255. 168.192.0.0...it will only return that 168.192.0.0 is correct. not any of the other addresses. thank you. ..**..import re..filename = input(""please enter the name of the file containing the input ip addresses: "").fo = open(filename, ""r"")...print().for line in open(filename):.        pattern = '^(?:[0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$'.m = re.match(pattern, line).if m is not none:.        print(""match found - valid ip address: "", line, ""n"").else: print(""error - no match - invalid ip address: "",line, ""n"")..fo.close"
