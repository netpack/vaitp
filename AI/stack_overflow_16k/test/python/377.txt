"assist with blank script i have written a code in blank, and i want to change it..i use it when i am performing a penetration tests in my organization and i want to make my script better..the script gets a username that i entering and it connect to the smtp server over port 25 and check if the user exists or not..here is the script:..#!/usr/bin/blank..import socket.import sys..if len(sys.argv) != 2:. print ""usage: vrfy.py &lt;username&gt;"".        sys.exit(0)..# create a socket.s=socket.socket(socket.af_inet, socket.sock_stream)..# connect to the server.connect=s.connect(('192.168.0.10',25))..# recieve the banner.banner=s.recv(1024).print banner..# vrfy a user.s.send('vrfy ' + sys.argv[1] + 'rn').result=s.recv(1024).print result..# close the socket.s.close()...the changes that i want to perform are the following:.instead of entering only one username to check, i want to mention a location of a txt file and the script will read all the usernames it contains...also, i what that the ip address at the script wont be hard coded and i will need to insert it every time i am using the script..many thanks in advance,..bar aviv"
