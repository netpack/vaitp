"how to explicitly move the cursor in blank i wanted to know if there was any way i could print a set of lines in blank and then move the cursor up or down to different locations. for example,.output:.first name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last name .email address.password..if i printed the above lines, how would i able to move the cursor from after password to where it would usually be to, just after first name so that the user could enter raw input to be stored in a specific variable."
