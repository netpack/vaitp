"creating a ""formation"" from a range of any numbers i would like to create a 'formation' for my boids to follow but there can be any number of boids in the formation. i would like a circle formation. so how can i go through the number of boids in the formation and manipulate there (x,y) so that they fill out a circular shape?..i have:self.flock_formation = [] under class flock.__init__ and self.pos(math3d.vectorn(x,y) under class boid.__init__..this is in class flock:..def create_formation(self):.    for boid in range(0, len(self.boids)):.        spot = math3d.vectorn(x, y).        self.flock_formation.append(spot)...i am having trouble understanding what i might need to do to come up with the positions in a circle the size of the number of boids in the flock. any ideas or example code would be helpful, thanks."
