"blank: how to check an xml file every x minutes for new entries, but not alert on previously alerted entries i'm using urllib2 and elementtree to monitor an xml file for new entries, and pushover to send push notifications every time a new entry is detected. entries exist in the xml file for anywhere from 30 min to 4 hours. the script runs every 5 minutes. what is the best way to make the script only alert me on the new entires and not the same entries every 5 minutes?"
