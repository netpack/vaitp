"can i/o operations be parallel in blank's threadpoolexecutor? in cblank, gil doesn't let blank code run in parallel threads but gil is released when i/o operation is performed...say there are several relatively lengthy i/o operations: dump some raw data to file, create log file entry and perform postgres query. if i run all of them via threadpoolexecutor, will they run in parallel?..are my initial assumptions correct?"
