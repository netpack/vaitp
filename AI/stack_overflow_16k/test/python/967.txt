"get array values in blank i have the values arr1  as 25,26 and arr2 values as a,b..its always that the number of values in arr1 and arr2 are equal..my question is that..          for i in arr1.split("",""):.                print i //prints 25 and 26...is it not possible to get the values of arr2 in the same loop or should  another loop be written only for this purpose.basically the idea is that map the values of arr1 and arr2"
