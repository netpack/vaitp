"finding duplicate values only for 2 highest values in a dict code:..candidates_and_fp_votes = {'a': 25, 'b': 0, 'c': 17, 'd': 23, 'e': 0}..print(candidates_and_fp_votes).final_vals = [a for a, b in candidates_and_fp_votes.items() if.              list(candidates_and_fp_votes.values()).count(b) &gt; 1].print(""duplicates are: "").for i in final_vals:.    print(i).print(final_vals)..if not final_vals:.    print(""no tiebreaker sys required"").else:.    print(""tie-breaker required"")...currently, this outputs ""tie-breaker required"" as 'b' and 'e' have a value of 0..i would like this so it only finds duplicates that affect the highest or second highest value..eg:...right now, it should print ""no tiebreaker sys required because even if there is a duplicate with 'b' and 'e' it is not .a duplicate with the second and highest values '25' and '23'.if the dict to be = {'a': 25, 'b': 0, 'c': 23, 'd': 23, 'e': 0}.it would print out ""tie-breaker required as it is affecting the 2nd highest value - 23....also, i just had a little change in mind, if the highest score is duplicating with a number but this number does not duplicate with the second highest, it would just output ""no tiebreaker sys required""..how can i do this?..thanks in advance."
