"project euler #23 - unable to figure out error in code link : http://projecteuler.net/problem=23...  this is a warning do not look further if you do not want to know the answer....i have been stuck for quite some time.i know there are solutions online. but i am just not able to figure out the problem in my code. i have attached the code for the code and the factors module that i have created. any help appreciated...actual answer = 4179871.    my answer = 4190404...from math import *.from time import *.from prime import *.from factors import *..abundant = list(n for n in xrange(12,28124) if n &lt; sum_of_factors(n))..sums = {}..for i in abundant:.    for j in abundant:.        if (i+j) > 28123:.            break.        else:.            sums[i+j] = 1..non_abun = [i for i in range(1,28124)].print sum(non_abun) - sum(sums)...code for factors - ...from time import *.from math import *..def factors(num):.    factors_array = [1,]..n = num.for k in range(2,int(ceil(sqrt(num)))):.    if(n%k == 0):.        if(k not in factors_array):.            factors_array.append(k).            factors_array.append(n/k)..return factors_array...def sum_of_factors(num):.    return sum(factors(num))"
