"why is os.system() not the recommended way to execute shell commands? according to this:...  in the previous section, we saw that os.system() function works fine. but itâ€™s not recommended way to execute shell commands. we will use blank subprocess module to execute system commands....the writer never mentions why os.system() is not the recommended way in his/her post. may i know why it's not recommended?..is there any security bug in os.system() that makes it not recommended way to execute shell commands?"
