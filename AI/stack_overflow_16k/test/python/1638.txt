"rock paper scissors i had a test for my comp sci class and one of the questions was to make a rock paper scissors game that if player 1 won it would return -1, if player 2 won it would return 1 and if it were a tie it would return 0. i made my program and ran it and it worked but according to my professor he said it didn't...def rps(x,y):.    player1 = -1.    player2 = 1.    tie = 0.    'r'&gt;'s'.    'p'&gt;'r'.    's'&gt;'p'.    if x&gt;y:.        return player1.    if x&lt;y:.        return player2.    else:.        return tie...i don't see what is wrong with it? it if you do rps('r','p') then it would return -1 because x = player1 and because rock beats paper. can anyone help me to see if my code is wrong?"
