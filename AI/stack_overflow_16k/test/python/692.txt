"accessing module level variables, from within a function in the module i'd like to be able to do something like this:..#mymodule.var = none..def load():.    var = something()...other module(s):..#secondmodule.import mymodule.mymodule.load()..#thirdmodule.from mymodule import var.print var #shouldn't be none...but i don't know how to reference a modules variable from a function defined in the module...is this possible? or am i going to need to put a global declaration in every place i wan't to use this..or am i going at this completely wrong?"
