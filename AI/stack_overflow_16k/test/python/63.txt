"comparing dictionaries (blank) i'm trying to create a program where i compare two strings' characters. i'm trying to make it where the second string has to have the same characters as the first. ..so if the first string is ""hello"" and the second is ""helloo"" it will turn out as false, but if the second string is ""ello"" it will be true...i have both strings in their own dictionary that counts the amount of each character. i'm trying to do this :..if dictionary1 &gt;= dictionary2 :.        print('true')...i don't know if i am thinking of this in an incorrect fashion, but i can't get this to work. i'm still relatively new to blank so if possible, please keep the explanations simple. thanks !"
