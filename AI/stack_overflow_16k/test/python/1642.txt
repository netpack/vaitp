"how to access and change(class) __init__ method attributes from another function in blank? recently i was trying to access an __init__ method attribute to change its values and recalculate some properties automatically from another function...i have tried some basic approaches and did not succeed to obtain what i wanted. this is the code in question:..class square():.     def __init__(self, length, width):.         self.length = length.         self.width = width..     @property.     def area(self):.         return self.length * self.width..a1 = square(length=3, width=3) ## made an object.print(a1.area) #9..def check():.    a = [].    b = [1,3,2].    t = [100,20,23].    d = [0.1].    c = 4.    for i in d:.        c += 6.        d += [0.1].        if a1.area &lt; 8: ## eg. if a1.length=2 and a1.width=2 have been changed in the  __init__ attribute this a1.area would be 4 and the condtion is ture and the loop break ends.            break ## here break the loop finally  if the a1.area is altered by the conditions .        for k in range(len(b)):.            a.append(c + b[k]).            if c + b[k] &gt; t[2]:.                a1.length = 2## here i am trying to change the __init__ attribute.                a1.width = 2 ## here i am trying to change the __init__ attribute.                print(k).                c = c - 6.                break.    return c"
