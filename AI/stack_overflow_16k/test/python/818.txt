"how to get string representations of classes and functions uniformly? i think is is best explained with an example. suppose i have a method that calculates the distances between two vectors and prints it. i also want that method to print the distance measure that was used. the distance measure is given to the function by the caller in the form of a callable object. if the callable is an instance of some class, i can provide the __str__ method to make it print out the name of the distance measure. but the callable can also be a function, and i have not found a way to change __str__ in that case. some code:..def distance(v1, v2, d):.    print d.    dist = d(v1, v2).    print dist.    return dist...if d is a function, print d will print out something like &lt;function somefunc at 0x1b68830&gt;. how can i change this? just printing out the name of the function would be fine, since i usually give them readable names."
