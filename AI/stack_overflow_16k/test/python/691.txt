"is there a discontinuous range class for blank? i'd like to represent an arbitrarily complex range of real values, which can be discontinuous, i.e.:..0--4 and 5--6 and 7.12423--8...where i'll be adding new ranges incrementally:..(0--4 and 5--6 and 7.12423--8) | ( 2--7) = (0--7 and 7.12423--8)...i don't really know the right language to describe this, so i'm struggling to search, but it seems like a class probably already exists to do what i want to do. does it?"
