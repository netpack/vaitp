"blank lru_cache explicit modification let's say i have the following function:..@lru_cache(maxsize=none).def very_expensive_function(arg):.    ......and during the runtime, i can calculate the result of the very_expensive_function (without calling it) for certain arguments..is it possible to inject those results to the cache without having the very_expensive_function figuring them out by itself?"
