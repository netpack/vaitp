"blank list object attribute 'append' is read-only as the title says, in blank, i'm trying to make it so when someone types in a choice (in this case choice13) then it deletes the old password from the list passwords and adds the new one instead...passwords = ['mrjoebblock' , 'mrjoefblock' , 'mrjoegblock', 'mrmjoeadmin' ].if choice == '3':.    password = raw_input('welcome admin! i'm going to need your password ').        if password == 'mrjoeadmin':.            print('welcome mr. joe!').            choice11 = raw_input('what would you like to do? press 1 for changing your admin password, 2 for viewing a class's comments, or 3 for changing a class's password').            if choice11 == '1':.                print('you have chosen to change your password! ').                choice12 = raw_input('you will need to put in your current password to access this feature ').                if choice12 == 'mrmajoeadmin':.                    choice13 = raw_input('what would you like to change your password to? ').                    passwords.remove('mrjoeadmin').                    passwords.append = choice13"
