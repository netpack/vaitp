"sequence of binary numbers i want to get a string that contains all binary numbers up to a given number..at the output, i need a string...bi = str(input()).n = int(bi , 2)..line = """".for i in range(1 , n + 1):.    line += str(bin(i))[2:]..print(line)...my code does this, but i want to get a more beautiful and optimal solution...for example:..input: 101..output: 11011100101 (1 10 11 100 101)"
