cannot import modules of parent packages inside child packages i have a parent package that has 2 child packages. it looks like this..backend.   __init__.py.   conf.py.   db.py.   connections.py.   /api.      __init__.py.      register.py.      api.py.   /scheduled.      __init__.py.      helpers.py...all the __init__.py files are empty...the code in backend/connections.py and backend/conf.py is being used by modules in both packages api and scheduled...in register.py i have code like..from backend.conf import *.from backend.connections import *...now when i do blank register.py.i get this error..importerror: no module named backend.conf...also when i changed from backend.conf import * to from ..conf import * or from .. import conf i get this error..valueerror: attempted relative import in non-package...what i understand by the above error is that blank is not treating the above folders as packages. but i have __init__.py in all the folders. what is wrong?
