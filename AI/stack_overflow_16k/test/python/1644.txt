"i am getting an typeerror in my blank 3.x program and i dont know how to change it i am new to blank and programming in general, i am currently using codecademy to learn this course, however i have tried to expand on abit of what i know from the course and develop little ideas i have,  to help me understand better. however when ever get to this part of the code, it gives me this error. ..  file ""teamselector.py"", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;.    print (""n you have been asigned to team number: "" + str(teamselection % teams)).typeerror: not all arguments converted during string formatting.ps c:usersworridocumentsdevelopmentblank&gt;...here is my full code..import sys..testint = 64.teams = input(""n how many teams are there? n"").print (""there are "" + teams + "" number of teams."")..totalplayers = input (""n how many total players are there n"").print (""there are "" + totalplayers + "" players to be selected into teams."")..teamselection = input (""n what is your assigned number? n"")..print (""n you have been asigned to team number: "" + str(teamselection % teams))...i have tried many things, even having a seperate variable to do the calculation to pass it as part of the string at the end,  i have looked on google for different ways and whatever i have tried it gives the same error.  i understand enough that i think the typeerror is having problems passing the float/int to a string, but i cant seem to find a .tostring() feature, that i have used before when i tried to learn java.  if anyone can help me i would be most grateful. thank you."
