"file reading & counting & sorting by hours in blank i'm new to blank &amp; here is my question ..write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. you can pull the hour out from the 'from ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon..from stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za sat jan  5 09:14:16 2008.once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below...link of the file:..http://www.blanklearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt ..this is my code:..name = raw_input(""enter file:"").if len(name) &lt; 1 : name = ""mbox-short.txt"".handle = open(name)..counts = dict().for line in handle:.    if not line.startswith (""from ""):continue.    #words = line.split()..    col = line.find(':').    coll = col - 2.    print coll...    #zero = line.find('0').    #one = line.find('1').    #b = line[ zero or one : col ].    #print b.    #hour = words[5:6].    #print hour..    #for line in hour:.     #   hr = line.split(':').      #  x = hr[1]..    for x in coll:.        counts[x] = counts.get(x,0) + 1..        for key, value in sorted(counts.items()):.            print key, value...my first try was with list splitting(comments) and it didn't work as it considered the 0 &amp; the 1 as the first &amp; the second letter not the numbers.second one was with line find (:) which is partially worked with minutes not with hours as required!!..first question..why when i write line.find(:), it takes automatically the 2 numbers after?..second question..why when i run the program now, it gives an error .typeerror: 'int' object is not iterable on line 26 ??..third question..why it considered 0 &amp; 1 as first &amp; second letters of the line not  0 &amp; 1 numbers ..finally .if possible please solve me this problem with a little of explanation please (with the same codes to keep my learning sequence)..thank you..."
