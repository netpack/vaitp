"how to write a generator that returns all-but-last items in the iterable in blank? i asked some similar questions [1, 2] yesterday and got great answers, but i am not yet technically skilled enough to write a generator of such sophistication myself...how could i write a generator that would raise stopiteration if it's the last item, instead of yielding it?..i am thinking i should somehow ask two values at a time, and see if the 2nd value is stopiteration. if it is, then instead of yielding the first value, i should raise this stopiteration. but somehow i should also remember the 2nd value that i asked if it wasn't stopiteration...i don't know how to write it myself. please help...for example, if the iterable is [1, 2, 3], then the generator should return 1 and 2...thanks, boda cydo...[1] how do i modify a generator in blank?..[2] how to determine if the value is one-but-last in a blank generator?"
