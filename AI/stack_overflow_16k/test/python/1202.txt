"difference between two list of unordered tuples i have two lists with tuples as shown below..a=[(""a"",""b"",""c""),(""d"",""e"",""f""),(""h"",""e"",""d"")].b=[(""b"",""c"",""a""),(""d"",""e"",""f"")]...i want to get the difference between two lists efficiently considering that the order of the elements in the tuple do not matter. so set(a) - set(b) does not work, which gives me [('a', 'b', 'c'), ('h', 'e', 'd')] as output...instead, i want the output given below. it should detect tuples as the same if the elements are just shuffled, such as (a, b, c) and (b, a, c)...[('h', 'e', 'd')]"
