"how to extends a list with all superclass values in blank? my intention is to get a list completed with the values that are assigned to a variable in each class of superior nature in the simplest way possible...class first:.    list = [].    def get_final_list(self):.        return self.list..class second(first):.    list = ['one']..class third(second):.    list = ['two']...result: list = ['one','two']..this is an example of the final result but obviously the whole logic of the function to return this value is missing."
