"how to check whether the value of a variable is updated or not in blank i am new to the blank and here i have a quick question. ..say in a while loop, i have a variable called center, and center is a list, as shown above: ..     m = cv2.moments(c).    center = (int(m[""m10""] / m[""m00""]), int(m[""m01""] / m[""m00""]))...center will always be [x,y] and since m is dynamically changed all the time, so does the center. ..my question is how can i know whether center is updated or not? if it is updated, how can i mathematically compare this the new center with the previous center? ..thanks."
