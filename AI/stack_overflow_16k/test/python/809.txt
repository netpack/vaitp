"how is this conditional being handled? i just ran into a weird bug in my code due to a typo where i had used a comma in a conditional rather than an and keyword. see the code below for a watered down example:..def foo():.    s = set([1, 2, 3]).    a = 4.    b = 5.    if (a, b in s):      # should have been: if (a and b in s):.        print ""foo""..foo()  # prints ""foo""...why does the conditional evaluate to true? even if a is none, ""foo"" gets printed."
