"printing string containing variables in blank i am a novice blank learner, though i know printing text containing strings and variables but i want to ask a basic question regarding this. here is my code:..x=5                                                                                        .print (""the value of x is "",x)                                      .print ""the value of x is"",x...the first print command prints ('the value of x is ', 5) while the second one prints, the value of x is 5. but print ('hello') &amp; print 'hello' prints hello (the same), why?"
