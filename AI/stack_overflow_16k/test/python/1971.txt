"what is the scope of the variable ""a""? .  possible duplicate:.  blank variable scope question  .....the blank manual defines the scope as:...  a scope defines the visibility of a name within a block. if a local.  variable is defined in a block, its scope includes that block. if the.  definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to any blocks.  contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces.  a different binding for the name....i have this program:..import random.def f():.  a = ""is the scope static?"".  if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:.    del a.  print a...there is a 50% chance that the print will fail:..&gt;&gt;&gt; f().is the scope static?.&gt;&gt;&gt; f().traceback (most recent call last):.  file ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;.  file ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 5, in f.unboundlocalerror: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment...by that, i think that there is a 50% chance that the print statement is outside the scope of 'a', but i can be wrong. what is the ""correct"" interpretation of scope in blank? is the scope of a variable in blank defined statically? what is the scope of the variable ""a""?"
