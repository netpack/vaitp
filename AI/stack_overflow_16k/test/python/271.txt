"creating a new list from a percentage of the previous list? hi guys so i have a program here that has the user enter a sequence of numbers that is then covered to a list..total = int(input(""how many numbers do you want to enter? ""))..mylist = [].for i in range (total):.    n = int(input(""enter a number &gt;&gt; "")).    mylist.append(n)..print (""the list is"").for i in range(total):.    print (mylist[i])...it works fine and is compatible to the rest of the program but what i need is to make a new list from mylist however the new list must only have data that belongs to the sub-range 5%- 95% of the original data..i'm not really sure how to do that...using blank 3.2.3 idle"
