"taking a string from a blank list and using it to update a variable of the same name? i'm trying to make blank take a string from a list at random and then use that string to determine what variable of the same name to add 1 to. i can't use a dictionary because of how i'm using the variables in other modules...this is what i have for an example:..import random..item1 = 0.item2 = 0.item3 = 0..items = (""item1"",""item2"",""item3"").item = random.choice(items)..#i want it to find the variable of the same name and then add 1 to said variable.#depending on what item is chosen to be ""item""."
