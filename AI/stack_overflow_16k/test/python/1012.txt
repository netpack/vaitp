"how would i write a function that finds all occurrences of a specific value in a list -- continues on and records--in a separate list--these occurrences in terms of the indices where they were found. .for example find_all([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2], 2) returns [1, 5]. find_all([1, 2, 3], 0) returns [ ]...i'm totally new to blank and this question is stumping me on my first homework. i need to..take 2 arguments: a list of items, and a single element to search for in the list.returns 1 list: a list of indices into the input list that correspond to elements in the input list that match what we were looking for..not sure"
