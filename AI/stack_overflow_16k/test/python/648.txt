"first true value if statement i am looping through the lines of a text document, trying to find the first blank line that occurs after another line (say line 100 for this example)...my code is:..blanklines=[].f=open(myfile, 'r').for num, line in enumerate(f):.    if line=='n' and num&gt;100:.        blanklines.append(num).result=blanklines[0]...there are multiple lines that meet this criteria, but i just want the first line that meets it. what is the most elegant way of doing this? is there a way to do it without creating a list and then selecting the first element?..thanks!"
