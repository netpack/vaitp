"blank date / time regular expression i am pretty new to regular expressions and it's pretty alien to me. i am parsing an xml feed which produces a date time as follows:..wed, 23 july 2014 19:25:52 gmt...but i want to split these up so there are as follows:..date = 23/07/2014.time = 19/25/52...where would i start? i have looked at a couple of other questions on so and all of them deviate a bit from what i am trying to achieve."
