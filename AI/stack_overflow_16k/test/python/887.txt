"robber's language in blank error i am a beginning in blank...i have a function that checks if it is a vowel...def vowel(x):.if(x=='a' or x=='e' or x=='i' or x=='o' or x=='u'):.    return true;.else:.    return false;...and a function that tries to convert the string to a robber's language by using the vowel function above. (the algorithm for conversion is to double every consonant and place an ""o"" in between)...def robber(text):.    s="""".    for i,c in enumerate(text):.       if vowel(c)==false:.           s=s.join([c,'o',c]).    return s;...when i try to run it by passing robber(""asdf"") into the function, i get a blank line and ""process finished with exit code 0""..i suspect that there might be multiple errors, but the program is syntactically correct. could you help me with this?"
