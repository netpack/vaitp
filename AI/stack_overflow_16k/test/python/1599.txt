"what is a simple fuzzy string matching algorithm in blank? i'm trying to find some sort of a good, fuzzy string matching algorithm. direct matching doesn't work for me â€” this isn't too good because unless my strings are a 100% similar, the match fails. the levenshtein method doesn't work too well for strings as it works on a character level. i was looking for something along the lines of word level matching e.g....  string a: the quick brown fox..  .  string b: the quick brown fox jumped.  over the lazy dog..  .  these should match as all words in.  string a are in string b....now, this is an oversimplified example but would anyone know a good, fuzzy string matching algorithm that works on a word level."
