"calling a function printmultiples i need to write a function printmultiples(lst) that takes a list of numbers and prints the number if it is a multiple of 8..&gt;&gt;&gt; printmultiples([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])...so whenever i run this i don't get any output just a blank line. i'm told i need to call the function printmultiples, but i am clueless how to do that...printmultiples = [(2, 3 ,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)].def printmultiples(lst):.    for i in lst[0]:.        if (i%8==0):.          print (i)...i should see the number 8 print out but i seem to be missing a step or a line."
