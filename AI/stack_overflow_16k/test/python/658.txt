"blank jumble solver algorithm i need to write  a code for the given problem...i'm provided with a word and i need to find all the possible combination of it that matches with a given list of words in a file...here's my code. can i make it much better. i'm sure it can be. please suggest...dict = {}                                                .file = open(""/usr/share/dict/words"", ""r"")                ..for word in file:                                        #iterate through every word in the dictionary.        word = word.strip().lower()                        #strip newlines and send to lowercase.        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))                #alphabetically sort the word.        if sorted_word in dict:                                #check if sorted_word is already a key.                if word not in dict[sorted_word]:        #make sure word is not already in the list under the key sorted_word.                        dict[sorted_word].append(word)        #add to list under the key sorted_word.        else:                                                #if not in dictionary.                dict[sorted_word] = [word]                #create new list with one entry.while(true):                                                #loop until quit is typed.        jumble = raw_input(""enter a jumble to decode or 'quit': "")        #get input.        jumble = jumble.lower()                                #send jumble to lower.        if(jumble == ""quit""):                                #quit if quit is typed.                break.        jumble = ''.join(sorted(jumble))                #sort jumble alphabetical.        if jumble in dict:                                #if sorted jumble exists in dictionary.                results = dict[jumble]                        #get list of words that match jumble.                for result in results:                        #loop through list printing results.                        print result,                        #trailing , designates that there should be a space between entries.                print """"                                #print newlines.        else:                                                #jumble not found in dictionary print message.                print ""results for jumble not found"""
