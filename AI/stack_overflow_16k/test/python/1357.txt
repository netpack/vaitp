"project euler #16 on blank import math..def sumofdigit(num):.    sum_of_digits = 0.    while num &gt; 9:.        sum_of_digits += num % 10.        num = int(num/10).    sum_of_digits += num.    return sum_of_digits..print sumofdigit(math.pow(2,1000))...this is what i thought of for project euler #16, and it works fine for smaller numbers. but when i tried 21000, the code gave me 1289.0 instead of the answer 1366 (found this on the internet). i think the problem might have to do with the size of the number, but i'm not sure. any points in the right direction will be appreciated. thanks in advance!..edit: here is the question https://projecteuler.net/problem=16"
