"why aren't both ""for loops"" working? import csv..def csv_reader(file_obj):      .    reader = csv.reader(file_obj).    # for row in reader:.        # print("" "".join(row))..    reader_2 = csv.dictreader(file_obj, delimiter="","").    for row_2 in reader_2:.        print(row_2)..csv_path = ""data.csv"".with open(csv_path, ""r"") as f_obj:.    csv_reader(f_obj)...i can't figure out why the second ""for loop"" only prints any text if the first ""for loop"" is commented out."
