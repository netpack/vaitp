"align two polygons, there are the same but one polygon is damaged i have two polygons that made from a number of points. as shown in the image:....suppose a is equal to a' and b is equal to b' and c is not the same as c'. is there any way that i can align the left polygon with the right polygon? i learn that i can check where they are aligned by calculating the intersection area of two polygons. if the intersection area is the same as the left polygon, they are aligned. however, i cannot find any algorithm that can merge to the result. has anyone any good ideas? thank you so much!"
