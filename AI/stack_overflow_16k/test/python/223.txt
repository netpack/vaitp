"trying to get pymediainfo to work i'm trying to get this module to work.i installed pymediainfo but i keep getting this error:.""importerror: no module named 'bs4'""..it says this on the module docs:.""this is a simple wrapper around the mediainfo command line interface, which you can find at the mediainfo project site found at http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/..beyond that requirement, this simple library should work with the standard blank library, as itâ€™s only dependancies are subprocess and xml.dom""..if i don't need any other libraries how do i get this to work?"
