"how can i compare times (expressed as minutes and hours) correctly? current_hour = 12.current_minute = 37.current_section = ""pm"".due_hour = 9.due_minute = 0.due_section = ""am""...given the current time and deadline time represented by the.variables above, determine if an assignment is still eligible.for submission. an assignment is eligible if the time.represented by current_hour, current_minute, and.current_section is before the time represented by due_hour,.due_minute, and due_section...my code is ..total_min_cur=((current_hour*60)+current_minute).total_min_due=((due_hour*60)+due_minute).print((total_min_cur&lt;=total_min_due)  and (due_section &gt;= current_section) )...we tested your code with due_minute = 0, current_hour = 12, current_minute = 37, due_section = ""am"", due_hour = 9, current_section = ""am"". we expected your code to print this:..true..however, it printed this:..false"
