delete files from directory based on file name version i would like to delete old zip files from directory based on file name where date created cant be taken into account..e.g. ..pyhtonreport_20180404_03.zip.pyhtonreport_20180404_02.zip.pyhtonreport_20180404_01.zip.pyhtonreport_20181221_02.zip.pyhtonreport_20181221_01.zip.pyhtonreport_20180816_01.zip...end result:..pyhtonreport_20180404_03.zip.pyhtonreport_20181221_02.zip.pyhtonreport_20180816_01.zip...i am tryign to read first 23 characters and if it match with second then compare file1 to file2. if the value is false then append to list and eventually delete it. ..import os.source = r'c:userspyhton'.for filename in os.listdir(source):.    groupfile = filename[0:22]...lost how to keep the value of first file and keep on checking.
