"why is my code saying the answer is wrong when its right? the code is supposed to be a simple maths quiz, however, when i enter the correct answer, it says it's wrong. my code is:..import random.name = input(""what is your name? "").question = 0.correct = 0..while question &lt; 10:.    question = question + 1.    number1 = random.randint(1, 50).    number2 = random.randint(1, 50).    print(""what is"", number1, ""+"", number2).    answer = number1 + number2.    print(answer).    student = input()..    if student == answer:.        print(""correct! well done!"").        correct = correct + 1.    else:.        print(""wrong!"")...any ideas?"
