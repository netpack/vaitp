"blank - check if multiple string entries contain invalid chars using blank v2.x, i have 3 variables that i want to ask the user for, as below:.. def main():..    chars = set('0123456789')..    while true:.       class_a_input = raw_input('enter class a tickets sold: ').       class_b_input = raw_input('enter class b tickets sold: ').       class_c_input = raw_input('enter class c tickets sold: ')..        if any((c in chars) for c in class_a_input):.            break.        else:.            print 'wrong'..    total_profit((int(class_a_input)), (int(class_b_input)), (int(class_c_input)))...how can i check if the user input is a valid input. ie: i want only numerical data entered. i have done this once before using 'chars = set('0123456789') and the 'while' functions, but cannot seem to get it to work for multiple inputs...thanks for any help...edit: i have put the code in now as i have it. i moved the 'int' to the 'total_profit' variable. how can i check all inputs?"
