"read a multiline string in blank i need to parse a string and read a particular substring from it. the string i need to parse is as follows :..domain.(.    (device.          (console.               (xxxxxx).               (xxxxxx).          ).    ).)..domain.(.    (device.          (vfb.               (xxxxxx).               (location : 5903).          ).    ).)...this is just a sample string. the actual string might contain many such substrings..i need to get the value of location field just from the ""vfb"" substring. i tried the findall and search functions as follows..import re.text=re.search('(device(vfb(.*?)))',stringname)...and..import re.text=re.findall('(device(vfb(.*?)))',stringname,re.dotall)...but i am getting empty string always..is there a easy way to do this ? thanks"
