"what is the cleanest way to initialize dynamic list in blank? this is a question regarding best coding practices. suppose i have to populate a list of unknown length; usually i just initialize the list with mylist = [], but i feel like this is a poor way of doing this. i often end up with chunks of code that look like this:..list1 = [].list2 = [].list3 = []..for a,b,c in zip(x,y,z):.    list1.append(a).    list2.append(b).    list3.append(c)...i realize in the example you can initialize this lists to the correct length, in fact you can just use x,y,z as they are. my question is regarding a situation in which you don't necessarily know the length of the lists. in my opinion, having to use three lines to initialize this lists is clunky; what do you guys thing? thanks for any input!"
