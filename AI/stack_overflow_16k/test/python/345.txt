"grab data from text based on key word match i have a text file with the following content:..name1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 ..............namen -1 -1 1 1 -1 1 ...also, i have a function that returns one of the names in the file, randomly. is there a way to convert the text document into a manageable blank data type? basically, if the function returns name1, i want to grab the integer vector associated to ""name1""."
