"asyncio for loop with bots i am doing a card game where i decided to make the amount of bots to be selectable. something i found out to be quite tricky was how i would make sure this still retain its asyncronocity, because my for loop unfortunately makes it syncronous. any ideas on how to get it asyncronous yet have the for iterate through every element?..blank code:..async def play():.    ai_count = int(input(""how many opponents do you want?n"")).    card_takers = [[ai(num) for num in ai_count] + player + [[]]].    for participant in card_takers[0:-1]:.        participant.say_hello().        for _ in range(4):.            participant.hand.append(gamedeck.deal()).    while true:.        card_takers[0].hand.append(gamedeck.deal()).        for participant in card_takers[0:-1]: card_takers[card_takers.index(participant)+1].append(participant.place_card())"
