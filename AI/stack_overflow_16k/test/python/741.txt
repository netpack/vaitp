"blank: include files from other directories into a project i have multiple blank projects which should use a number of shared files but i can not figure out how to do this in blank...if i just copy the file into the pyhton working directory it works fine with:..from hbonds import calculatehbondsforseveralreplicas, comparesameshapehbmatrices, calculatehbonds...but i do not want to copy it. i want to include it from: /home/b/data/blankworkspace/util/hbonds..for me it would make sense to do it like this (but it does not work):..from /home/b/data/blankworkspace/util/hbonds/hbonds.py import calculatehbondsforseveralreplicas, comparesameshapehbmatrices, calculatehbonds...how can i do this?"
