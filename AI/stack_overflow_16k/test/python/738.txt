"blank jump to another variable after list append i want to distribute amount of money to operators but after append for loop jumps not to another variable:..op1 = [].op2 = [].op3 = [].operators = [op1, op2, op3].unsigned_loans = [100, 200, 300, 400]..sum_of_all_loans = 0..for loan in unsigned_loans:.    sum_of_all_loans += loan..per_user_amount = sum_of_all_loans / len(operators)..unsigned_loans.sort()....for oper in operators:.    for loan in unsigned_loans:.        print(loan).        if sum(oper) &lt; per_user_amount:.            oper.append(loan).        unsigned_loans.remove(loan).    print(oper)...output should be:.. op1=[100, 200] op2=[300] op3=[400]...but now it displays ..op1=[100, 300] op2=[200] op3=[400]"
