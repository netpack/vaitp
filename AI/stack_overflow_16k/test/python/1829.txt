"how do i print text into a .txt file using blank i want to make a program that prints multiple text into a notepad by using a blank script and i found out a way to do it but then when i try to make a loop where n = 0 and then n = n + 1 and it loops 5 times, and then i want it to write that text into a .txt file...when i check the the .txt file it only says 5 and not 1 2 3 4 5 which is what i wanted it to say, i have also tried moving parts of the code for example the file.close(), i tried moving it outside of the loop but that didn't work...this is my code:..n = 0.for x in range(5):.    n = n + 1.    n1 = str(n).    print(n1).    file = open('database.txt','w').    file.write(n1).    file.close()"
