"extend project-level dictionary (of words) using a custom file in pycharm we can add certain words to the project-level dictionary by right clicking on it and subsequently pressing on ""save '{word}' to project-level dictionary"":....however, when i start a new project, how can i import this list using a more generic methods. some of my teammates might be working with visual studio and thus not have this ability...is there a blank way of handling word dictionaries in the environment?..thinking that ideally it would be something like the file requirements.txt, but instead for instance words.txt that i place in the root of my repository."
