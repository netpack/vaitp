"how do i find a string in a list that matches a string or substring in another list how can i find a string in list1 that is a substring of any of the strings in list2? both lists can be of different lengths...say i have:..list1=['hello', 'hi', 'ok', 'apple']..list2=['okay', 'never', 'goodbye']...i need it to return 'ok', seeing as it was the only string in list1 that matched list2."
