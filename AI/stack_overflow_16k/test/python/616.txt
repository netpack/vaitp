"dynamic variable names from a list of strings in blank i'm coming from matlab and need to reimplement some data processing in blank/numpy. i have data files which are in a specific format, but it can vary which variables are listed in the file...in matlab i could write functions to stick the data arrays in handy structs, like this:..s = data_to_struct(filename).s.altitude.s.time.s.latitude.s.longitude.s.density.s.temperature...which i could then pass around to various plotting or filtering functions. i want to do the same in blank, using an object in place of the struct. i know the proper&trade; way is to use a dict, but for this very specific and limited case the dict syntax is uglier in my eyes:  s.temperature vs s['temperature'], as well as being more cumersome to type. what is the best way to read a string of variable names from file, and then create variables or object members with those names?..i will do a lot of interactive plotting and data handling, and i want to make the typing and tabbing as easy as possible."
