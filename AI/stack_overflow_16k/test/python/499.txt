"how to get information about descending order of elements from a square matrix i have a square matrix which is basically a correlation matrix, so all the elements are in the range of -1 to +1. i need to sort the elements within some range say 0.5 to 0.75 in descending order with the information of coordinate. i need the coordinate to build a network. ..here is my 3*3 matrix:..a = array([.    [1, 0.7, 0.3],.    [0.65, 1, 0.86],.    [0.67, 0.53, 1].])...i am a newbie here. ..i am expecting my result as :..the coordinate  of 0.7 (0, 1).the coordinate of 0.67 (2, 0).the coordinate of 0.65 (1, 0).the coordinate of 0.53 (2, 1)...thanks."
