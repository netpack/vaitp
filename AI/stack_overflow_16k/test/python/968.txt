"removing data after decimal in blank i have columns of parsed hex values  from an excel file ..4.0.123.0.ffe.5432535.0...and the list goes on. i'm writing all the data in this formatted c header file and do not want any of the data to the right of the decimal or the decimal itself...for example: ..4.0 -&gt; 4.5432535.0 -&gt; 5432535...what's the best way to go about doing this?..my problem is they are hex val ,so they can contain letters as well. the data is being parsed using xlrd and stored in the variable in this type of format...cell_val3 = sheet.cell_value(row_iteration, 20)"
