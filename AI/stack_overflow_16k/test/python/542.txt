"blank excercicse i decided to make myself a little bit more useful, so i thought that learning computer languages would be a pretty good idea. i started with blank, because i everyone i asked recommended it for a beginner. ..i found an interactive website to do some exercises before going to the developing tool for practice. i know most of you will laugh, but i got stuck at exactly this point: ..x = object().y = object()..# change this code.x_list = [x].y_list = [y].big_list = []..print ""x_list contains %d objects"" % len(x_list).print ""y_list contains %d objects"" % len(y_list).print ""big_list contains %d objects"" % len(big_list)..# testing code.if x_list.count(x) == 10 and y_list.count(y) == 10:.    print ""almost there..."".if big_list.count(x) == 10 and big_list.count(y) == 10:.    print ""great!""...well, i figured out the big_list. i have to write [x_list * 10 + y_list * 10] ..the thing that i cannot figure out the last 30 minutes, is what values to i need to set in the object brackets (1st line of the command)..thanks for your help in advance!"
