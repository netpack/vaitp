"blank: ""you must read the data using raw_input and then convert it"" i'm doing an assignment described below but i'm stuck with an error:...  write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using.  raw_input to compute gross pay. pay the hourly rate for the hours up.  to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40.  hours. use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program.  (the pay should be 498.75). you should use raw_input to read a string.  and float() to convert the string to a number....here is my code:..hrs = raw_input(""enter hours:"").h = float(hrs).rateinput=raw_input(""enter hourly rate:"").rate=float(rateinput)..if h &gt; 40:.    remainderhours=h-40.    h=40.    remainderrate=10.50*1.5.else:.    remainderhours = 0..normalpay= float ( h * rate).overtimepay = remainderhours * remainderrate.pay = normalpay + overtimepay.grosspay= pay.print grosspay...i get the right answer of 498.75. but it will not let me pass the assignment as the method error you must read the data using raw_input and then convert it comes up. i've been trying to fix it for a while but i'm kind of baffled at what i am doing wrong. could anyone shed some light on my problem? any help is appreciated."
