"how to use counter if a certain condition is met? i am working on a video analysis project. i have a situation where if a person comes in front of the object (e.g. bag)(bounding boxes intersect ) my pre-defined function should wait for 100 counts before calling it as a belonging of a person..i have written the following code :..count = 0.iou_value = oneobject.intersection_over_union(image,humanregion_bbs,belongings_bbs).if iou_value is not none and iou_value &gt; th_iou and count &gt; 100 :.        oneobject.setbelongings(belongingslist) #this sets the belongings to the person...i want this setbelongings() to wait for 100 counts before running. this is just a part of a long code i have added. the whole code runs once each frame of a video"
