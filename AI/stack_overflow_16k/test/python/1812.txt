"how do you write blank code and execute it on a remote server? i know there are many blank ides, im using pycharm right now, files are on my local mac, and when i run my code it runs on my local blank interpreter..how is the workflow if i would be writing a script for my linux server, which is another machine?..i know i can write the code on the linux server itself, and execute it there,, but, is it possible to use still my mac with my pycharm and write code that reside on the linux server and gets executed there?"
