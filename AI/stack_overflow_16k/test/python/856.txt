"how to add random colors to random circles i need to get a different colors filled in for the different size of the circles each time when i run the code...from graphics import*.from random import*.from time import*..circle_x=0.circle_y=0.colors =0..#graphics window.def main():.    win = graphwin(""bubbles"", 500,500).    message = text(point(250,200),""click anywhere to continue"").    message.draw(win).    win.getmouse().    message.undraw().main()    ..#create circle.def create():.    win = graphwin(""bubbles"", 500,500).    for i in range (4):..    # creating a random point for the x of the circle.        circle_x = randint(50,450)..    #creating a random point for the y of the circle.        circle_y = randint(0,100)..        p = point(circle_x,circle_y)..        radius_x = randint(3,20).        c = circle(p,radius_x)..        colors = (""salmon"",""red"",""blue"",""green"",""purple"",""orange"",""yellow"").        fill = choice (colors)..        c.draw(win)...i have done this far, but somehow the color does not get filled in..i need to use choice."
