"blank 3.2 tic tac toe game replay? i programmed a tic tac toe game in blank and it works perfectly fine and everything. so i was wondering, can you somehow program the game to say, ""do you wish to play again?"" after the computer wins or if you win? ..in my game, once the computer wins or you win, it doesn't say anything and i want the game to ask the player if they want to play again. gracias(:"
