"blank doesn't run euler's method for widths smaller than 0.2? i have  curious question about blank coding. i have a simple code i used to perform euler approximations, which numerically approximates a solution for a differential equation. it does this by taking a section of the curve and dividing it into intervals of equal width 'w'...the code is:..import math..x = 0.y = 2.w = 0.5..while x &lt; 1:.    dydx = 1 - 2*x + y.    deltay = dydx*w.    y = y + deltay.    x += w.print(x,y)...curiously, i found that the code works for 'w' from 1 to 1/5, but not any smaller...for example, using w = 1/5, the code correctly outputs (1.0, 5.48832...)..or using w = 1/4. the code correctly outputs (1.0, 5.4414...)..but if i used w = 1/6, the output is (1.16667,6.27523...)..i have adapted the same code for programs running euler's modified method and romberg's method (for approximating the same thing) and they do the same thing for w &lt; 1/5...i feel like the answer to this is either very obvious or very obscure. if anyone has a solution, i would very much appreciate it...thank you"
