"cache a constant value i am developing an application for color blind people to enable them smoothly surf the internet. i have a set of colors, lets say a , which consists of all the colors seen by a color blind person. set a is calculated using a big calculation involving millions of colors. set a is independent of inputs taken in my application i.e set a is like a 'constant' to me (just like 'pi' in mathematics). now i want to store set a so that whenever i run my application, it is available without any added computational cost i.e i don't have to calculate a every time i run my application...my try:.i think this can be done by building a class having one constant but can it be done without creating any special class for just a constant?     ..i am using blank!"
