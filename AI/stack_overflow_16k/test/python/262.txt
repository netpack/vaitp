"need help or any advice on a pig dice game i have no prior experience with programming and i am taking my first programming class this semester and need some help with what i am doing wrong or advice on where to go from here.i still have to add in the computer opponent but one issue i am having is the hold portion only works sometimes. when it asks to roll again or hold i press h to hold and sometimes it works and others it acts like i hit r for rolling again. any help will be greatly appreciated. ..this is what i have so far:..import random..p1 = 0.p2 = 0..print (""score"" ""tyou :"", p1, ""tai :"", p2)..still_playing = true.hold_pass_input = false..while still_playing:..    while true:..        p1_turn = input (""your turn. hit enter to continue."").        p1_score = p1.        p2_score = p2.        break..    while (p1_score &gt;= 0 and p1_score &lt;= 50):.        die_roll = random.randint (1,6)..        if die_roll &gt; 1:.            p1_score = die_roll + p1_score.            print(""die :"", die_roll, ""pot :"", p1_score,)..            hold_pass = input(""(r)oll again or (h)old?:"").upper().            while hold_pass_input == false:..                if hold_pass in [""r"", ""r""]==[""r"", ""r""]:.                    hold_pass_input = true.                    break..                elif hold_pass in[""h"",""h""]==[""h"",""h""]:.                    hold_pass_input = false.                    print (""score"" ""tyou :"", p1_score, ""tai :"", p2_score).                    print(""it's the computers turn. hit enter to continue."").                    break..                else:.                    hold_pass_input = false.                    print(""use only r, r, h, h"").                    hold_pass = input(""(r)oll again or (h)old?:"").upper()..        elif die_roll &lt;= 1:.            p1_score = p1_score - p1_score.            print(""die :"", die_roll, ""pot :"", p1_score, ""bust"").            p2_turn = input(""it's the computers turn. hit enter to continue."")"
