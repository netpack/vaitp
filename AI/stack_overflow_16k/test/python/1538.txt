"opening and processing multiple files im learning file input/output and i was wondering how i would go about opening multiple files with a similar name. for example hw-data-01 , hw-data-02.....hw-data-99, i need to open these files and process them but im having trouble just opening them at all. here is what ive tried, ..i = 00.while i &lt; 100 :.    f = open(""hw09-data-%d.csv"", ""r"") % i.    for line in f :.        print line.    i = i + 1...problem is when i hit run to see if all files are read and printed, it says the directory cannot be found. im pretty sure its because 00 + 1 = 1 and not 01 which is the way the files are stored. im not really sure what to do now, i heard my teacher talking about the glob module but he did a really brief example and i dont know how to apply it here. any help would be appreciated"
