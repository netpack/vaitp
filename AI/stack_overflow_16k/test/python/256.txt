"if-else sentence in one-line-blank i have some code:..a_part = [2001, 12000].b_part = [1001, 2000].c_part = [11, 1000].d_part = [1, 10].data = range(1, 12000).labels = [a_part, b_part, c_part, d_part].sizes = []..# ---..for part in labels:.    sum = 0.    for each in data:.        sum += each if each &gt;= part[0] and each &lt;= part[1] else 0.        # error.        # sum += each if each &gt;= part[0] and each &lt;= part[1] .    sizes.append(sum).print(sizes)...and i rewrote this to be more blankic:..sizes = [sum(x for x in data if low&lt;=x&lt;=high) for low,high in labels].# error.# sizes = [sum(x for x in data if low&lt;=x&lt;=high else 0) for low else 0,high in labels].print(sizes)...i found that in the first snippet i can't leave out else 0 while the second example can't contain else 0...what is the difference else 0 makes between these examples?"
