"why an instance of class could be called? when using plt.cm.spectral in blank, i got some confused..after checking the type of plt.cm.spectral, i regard the var spectral in module plt.cm as an instance of class linearsegmentedcolormap..however, i also see that code colors = plt.cm.spectral(np.linspace(0, 1, 10)) could be executed without error. here is the point confusing me, why an instance of a class could be called, i.e. followed by parentheses with params inside?.thanks!"
