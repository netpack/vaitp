"how to load complex contents from file into blank program specifically? i'm having trouble with the input for a programming assignment:...  people in a town go shopping many times on a weekly basis. the town mayor wants to keep track of how many items a person buys every time they go shopping. he is only monitoring three houses. in each house, there are five members of the family. the data for each family should be kept separately..  code to solve this program....now, the file contents have to be loaded and saved to a file..i have planned for the input (for the first task) to look like the following in the file itself and also i would like it to appear as such when loaded into the program:..[['james',0],['katherine',0],['jacob',0],['michael',0],['cyndia',0]]...however, the code i currently have, which goes:..class11a = []..def class(filelabel,filename,readlabel,class):..    filelabel = open(filename,mode = 'r+').    readlabel = filelabel.read().    for line in readlabel:.        class.append(line)..class('class11a','class 11a.txt','class11atemplist',class11a).print (class11a)...yet, the code loads the contents like such:..['[', '[', ""'"", 'j', 'a', 'm', 'e', 's', ""'"", ',', '0', ']', ',', '[', ""'"", 'k', 'a', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'e', ""'"", ',', '0', ']', '[', ""'"", 'j', 'a', 'c', 'o', 'b', ""'"", ',', '0', ']', '[', ""'"", 'm', 'i', 'c', 'h', 'a', 'e', 'l', ""'"", ',', '0', ']', '[', ""'"", 'c', 'y', 'n', 'd', 'i', 'a', ""'"", ',', '0', ']', ']']...how do i solve this?..note: the same file structure will be used to load the data for the other two families."
