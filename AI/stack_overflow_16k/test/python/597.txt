"i have a method / function in blank in which i'm trying to get a return value which i can then use as a variable in another function so i'm trying to learn blank and at the same time write some code to help myself out with some mundane tasks..so i have a function which works just fine if i use the print statement to display just what i need, but when i replace the ""print"" statement for a ""return"" i only get the first element in the list, i know its because ""return"" causes the function to exit, but i have no idea how i can get this to return the rest of the elements..i have tried lots of things and been now reading for hours :( and still getting no further..objective: to read all the ""*.common"" files in a directory and then compare them with a text file containing some names, and if they match return the name of the *.common file so i can use it in another function as a variable..code i have thus far..# this method gets the list of common files.....def get_common_files():.    path = (config_home).    files = []..    for r, d, f in os.walk(path):.        for file in f:.            if '.common' in file:.                files.append(file)..    for f in files:.        return files..new_file = get_common_files()..def build_default_manifest():.    for line in fileinput.fileinput(new_manifest):.        for name in new_file:.            if line.strip() in name:.                print(name) # works as it should and displays all that i need.                return name  # only shows me the first element ...good_name = build_default_manifest().print(good_name)  ...i hope i've provided all that i need to but if not please feel free to comeback to me..."
