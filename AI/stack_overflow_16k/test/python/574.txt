"how do i declare a function and then assign it to a variable in the same line? i have a button class that has a variable, when_pressed, that is meant to be a function. for the sake of the question, let's assume that it will always be a function and not something like an int. when your instance of the button class is pressed, the function contained in when_pressed gets called. so you could do this:..def pressed():.    print(""pressed"").button = new button().button.when_pressed = pressed...this will print pressed when the button is pressed. makes sense...but i won't be needing that function anywhere else. i am dealing with a low-memory environment, so it would be easier to do something like this:..button = new button().button.when_pressed = function():.    print(""pressed"")...you could do this in javascript, so i think it's possible in blank too. but i can't find anything on it. how can i do this?"
