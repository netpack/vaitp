"why is the code detecting the outer most ) the problem here asks me to reverse any string inside (). let's say if my the string is ""foo(bar(baz))blim"", then the returned result would be ""foobazrabblim"" . someone helped me with the coding process, however, i still don't understand why the code is detecting the outer ) first...def reverseinparentheses(inputstring):.    n=len(inputstring).    for i in range(n):.        if inputstring[i] == ""("":.            start=i          .        if inputstring[i] == "")"":.            end=i          .            return reverseinparentheses(inputstring[:start]+.inputstring[start+1:end][::-1]+inputstring[end+1:n]).        return inputstring...for what i understand, let's say we have ""foo(bar(baz))blim"". so blank detect start=3, end=11. then we call function reverseinparetheses, we will have ""foozab(rab)blim"". going through the function again, there is the new start=6, end=10. in the end, we have ""foozabbarblim"" which is not ""foobazrabblim"" that we are expecting. i am wondering how is the program detecting the outer "")"" first?"
