"best way to test for existence of a variable in blank i am reading a million plus files to scrape out some data.  the files are generally pretty uniform but there are occasional problems where something that i expected to find is not present...for example, i expect some sgml code to identify a value i need..for data_line in temp  #temp is a list of lines from a file.    if &lt;variablename&gt; in data_line:.        variable_val=data_line.split('&gt;')[-1]...later on i use variable_val..but i sometimes get an exception: no line in the file that has..&lt;variablename&gt;thename...to handle this i have added this line after all the lines have been processed:..try:.    if variable_val:.        pass.except nameerror:.    variable_val=somethingelse...i have seen somewhere (but i can't find it anymore) a solution that looks like..if not variable_val:.    variable_val=somethingelse...any help would be appreciated"
