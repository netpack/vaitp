"inset imshow within figure matplotlib i'm trying to have an imshow plot inset into another in matplotlib...i have a figure that has an plot on top and an imshow on the bottom:..fig = plt.figure().ax1 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,1).plt.plot().ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,2).plt.imshow()...and then i have another figure, which also is comprised of a plot on top and an imshow below. i want this second figure to be inset into the top plot on the first figure...i tried follow this example. the code ran without an error but i had an empty axis in the position i wanted it...my problem is just that i'm not sure where to put the plt.setp() command if that's what i am supposed to use."
