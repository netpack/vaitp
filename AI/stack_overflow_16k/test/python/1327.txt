"using class/function in another module i come from a mostly java background, but have recently been delving into some blank. i've been mostly getting it, but there's some syntax that seems really weird to me. i have this project i'm working on that contains multiple files/ classes. i have one class, mesh.py:..class mesh:.    def __init__(self, name):.        #dostuff...that i want to instantiate in another file, main.py. i noticed two things, ...i have to import mesh, which seems odd to me, since it's in my project, .to create a mesh i have to do this:..mesh = mesh.mesh('name')....which seems super awkward. why can't i just do..mesh = mesh('name')...am i doing something wrong here, or is this just an unavoidable part of blank?"
