"what is the best way to call api for each data in the list/tuple in blank? i have a tuple with t = (10,20,30)..i want to call an api for each of the member of this tuple t..obviously, i can loop and call api - f(""hello"", b,10), f(""hello"",b,20),.f(""hello"",b,20)  for each item in the tuple...however, i am looking for a best way to do this in blank...i want to use map here or lambda. how can i do so?..how do i map with some default parameters?"
