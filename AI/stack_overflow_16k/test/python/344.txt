where is the best place to create connection strings for multiple environments in blank i'm decently new to how blank is set up and i'm wondering where is the best place to add string variables to use as connection strings for our different servers on our different environments. an example would be creating a connection string in the web.config in asp.net. then having different web.configs in the solutions on our environments. i read up on the configparser but is that the best practice?..thanks in advance.
