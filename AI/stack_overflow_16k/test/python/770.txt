"unlucky number 13 i came accorss this problem unlucky number 13!  recently but could not think of efficient solution this...problem statement :..n is taken as input. ...  n can be very large 0&lt;= n &lt;= 1000000009...find total number of such strings that are made of exactly n characters which don't include ""13"". the strings may contain any integer from 0-9, repeated any number of times...# example:..# n = 2 :.# output : 99 (0-99 without 13 number)..# n =1 :.# output : 10 (0-9 without 13 number)...my solution:..n = int(raw_input())..if n &lt; 2:.    print 10..else:.    without_13 = 10..    for i in range(10, int('9' * n)+1):.        string = str(i).        if string.count(""13"") &gt;= 1:.            continue.        without_13 += 1.    print without_13...output..the output file should contain answer to each query in a new line modulo 1000000009...any other efficient way to solve this ? my solution gives time limit exceeded on coding site."
