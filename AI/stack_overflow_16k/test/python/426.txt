"alignment hoirzontal instead of vertical i'm working on an assignment for school and we're supposed to make a script that counts to 100 in blocks of 10. so you would get number 1 to 10 in row 1, from left to right. in row 2 you'd get 10-20, from left to right, and so on...i've wrote some part of the script but i can't figure out how to allign it from left to right, instead of top to bottom. this is what i've got so far:..def number(count):. while count!=11:.    print(count).    count=count+1;.number(0)"
