"unboundlocalerror: local variable ""tries"" referenced before assignment i'm very new to programming and throwing myself in the deep end..trying to write a simple number guessing game, still very rough, but i'm getting an error i'm not sure how to fix...this is the code:..import random.    guessestaken= 0.    print ""you've got to guess a random number between 1 and 20""..def main():.    guessestaken = 0.    number = random.randint(1,20).    guess = 0.    while guess != number:..        print (""take a guess"").        guess = input(""your guess: "").        guess = int(guess).        guessestaken = guessestaken + 1.        if tries is none:.            tries = 0.        tries = tries + 1....        if guess &lt; number:.            print ""too low, try again""..        if guess &gt; number:.            print ""too high""...        if guess is number:.            print ""well done, you guessed the number in "", guessestaken, ""guesses.""...#        if guess != number:..x = 1.while x is 1:.#    if tries is 3: break.    guessestaken = 0.    main()...and i'm getting this error after:.unboundlocalerror: local variable 'tries' referenced before assignment, any help would be appreciated."
