"finding mode of a list i'm writing a function that calculates the mode or modes of a list of numbers. ..if input is [52, 99, 37, 86, 99, 99, 99, 37, 37, 37], output should be [37, 99]. as you can see smaller number should come first, but my code won't do it. can someone fix my code?..def mode(l):.    most = max(list(map(l.count, l))).    return list(set(filter(lambda x: l.count(x) == most, l)))"
