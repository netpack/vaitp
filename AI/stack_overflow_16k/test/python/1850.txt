"does blank have a partition_by function? is there some established recipe for partitioning a list according to some predicate? what i want to do is like an itertools groupby, but the predicate is going to be some arbitrarily complicated function (and not just a key). for example, imagine a list of students, and each student has a list of courses, and i want to group by those with courses in common. so it would be something like:..def coursework_intersection(a,b):.     return set(a['courses']).intersection(b['courses'])..list_of_lists = partition_by(coursework_intersection, students)"
