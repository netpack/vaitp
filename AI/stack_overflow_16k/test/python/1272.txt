"how to populate a class instance this is code i made last year that takes data from google sheets, and uses it to make a csv and upload assessment comments and grades to an online portal. i am sure this is not the best way to do this, but it works...how can i take the following code and put it into a class setting? ..orgid = wks1.col_values(1)   # student id in  1 = col a.names = wks1.col_values(2)   # student concat names 2= col b.mark = wks1.col_values(4)   # student mark   4 = col d.commentlist = wks1.col_values(15)   # student comments  15 = col o *****.commentlist =[x.strip(' ')  for x in commentlist] #removes spaces at the end of comments ..del orgid[0].del orgid[0].del mark[0].del mark[0].marklist = list(zip(orgid, mark)) #combines student id and marks for csv.del names[0].del names[0].del commentlist[0].del commentlist[0].toplist = list(zip(names, commentlist)) #combines student names and comments .sorting = lambda toplist: toplist[0].toplist.sort(key=sorting)...i have started making a class, but this is as far as i have gotten. i don't know how to take that info and put it into the class system. the youtube videos i have found deal with the creation of classes, but not so much how to put a larger amount of data into it. ..class student:.    def __init__(self, name, orgid, mark, comment):.        self.name=name.        self.orgid=orgid.        self.mark=mark.        self.comment=comment...i am sure this is rather basic, but i think that is where i'm at in my learning so far."
