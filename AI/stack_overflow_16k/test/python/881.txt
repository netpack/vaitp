"set a variable equal to result if result exists this seems very verbose, particularly with long function names, is there a better way to do this in blank?..if somerandomfunction():.    variable = somerandomfunction()...edit: for more context variable is not already defined, and it will be a new node on a tree. i only want to create this node if somerandomfunction() returns a value. and somerandomfunction() is supposed to return the string representation of some node from a different type of tree."
