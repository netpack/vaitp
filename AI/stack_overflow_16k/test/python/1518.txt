"what is the recommended practice in django to execute external scripts? i'm planning to build a webapp that will need to execute scripts based on the argument that an user will provide in a text-field or in the url...possible solutions that i have found:...create a lib directory in the root directory of the project, and put the scripts there, and import it from views..using subprocess module to directly run the scripts in the following way:..subprocess.call(['blank', 'somescript.py', argument_1,...])....argument_1: should be what an end user provides."
