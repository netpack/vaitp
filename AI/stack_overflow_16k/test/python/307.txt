"split integers in string - blank i've got a bunch of numbers in a string.  i want to split them into individual digits so i can do more with them later...number = [6, 18, 6, 4, 12, 18, 0, 18]...i want to split these like so.....ex: 6, 1, 8, 6, 4, 1, 2, 1, 8, 0, 1, 8..i've tried split(), i've tried list(str(number)), i've tried converting these to strings and integers and i have tried searching stackoverflow...in other searches i keep seeing a list comprehension example like this, which i don't understand and don't get the desired result after trying:.    [int(i) for i in str(number)]..help??"
