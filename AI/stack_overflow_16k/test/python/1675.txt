"how to avoid duplicate results while multithreading / multiprocessing in blank? i started programming in blank just a couple weeks ago. i have some experience with java, so it wasn't too hard too hard for me to set up...right now i have a program that uses urllib to scrape the source code of a list of sites...i have thousands of sites to scrape, so i'm obviously looking to make it multi-threaded or multi-processed (i don't really know the difference)...the good thing is that my multi-threading works! but it's basically pointless for me to do, because all of my threads are scraping the exact same sites and giving me nothing but duplicates...how can i avoid this issue? thanks for your help in advance :)"
