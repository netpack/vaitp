"newtonâ€™s method for finding square roots in blank this is a function that uses newton's method to solve for the square root of a given number:..def sqrt(n):.    approx = n / 2.0.    while true:.        better = (approx + n / approx) / 2.0.        if abs(approx - better) &lt; 0.00001:.            return better.        approx = better...what i do not understand is, that the function only returns ""better"", which is a integer, but the while loop depends on a boolean, so how is the while loop ever going to stop? where does the function returns a false to terminate the while loop?..many thanks in advance."
