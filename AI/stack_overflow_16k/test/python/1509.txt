"else statement executing even if 'if' is true i've been working on a blank script to detect keypresses. it uses the pygame module. my issue is when pressing the up, down and right arrow keys but not the left. i have seen this however it does not help me with my problem. the issue is when i press up, down or right it prints the appropriate text and them executes the else statement as well replacing even.unicode with this weird symbol whoever when i press the left arrow key it prints ""the key is left"" and no more, like it's supposed to. also pressing any normal key on the keyboard works fine. weird huh. if you can spot the boo boo i've made that would be really great. my code is below, you can copy and paste this into idle for 2.7 if you have pygame installed and see what i mean. ..#blank key detector, requires pygame module, uses blank 2.7.#import libraries.import pygame.import sys.from pygame.locals import *.#init display.pygame.display.init().#infinite loop.while (true):.    #event detector.    for event in pygame.event.get():.        #if a key is pressed.        if event.type == keydown:.            if event.key == 99:.                sys.exit().            if event.key == 273:.                print ""the key is up"".            if event.key == 275:.                print ""the key is right"".            if event.key == 274:.                print ""the key is down"".            if event.key == 276:.                print ""the key is left"".            else:.                print ""the key is "" + event.unicode"
