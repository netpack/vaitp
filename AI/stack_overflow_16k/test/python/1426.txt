"how to make one executable blank file from multiple blank files? i have these many blank files as below (folder structure)..each file is dependent on each other, means a given file needs to have at least one file imported to work...i need to make these files to one single files so i can just run that and get the output as i expect...here is how my folder structure looks like:..components/.   __init___.py.   a.py.sub/.   ___init__.py.   b.py.main.py.___init__.py...as above, the main.py is in the root folder and other two are in the folders components and sub..i am running this file (currently) by executing blank main.py from root directory...how can i package this into one single file and maybe protect it from others seeing my code implementation?"
