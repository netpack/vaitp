"is there a way for me to get detailed formatted information on a blank class? so, i know i can use dir() to get information about class members etc. what i'm looking for is a way to get a nicely formatted report on everything related to a class (the members, docstrings, inheritance hierarchy, etc.)...i want to be able to run this on the command-line so i can explore code and debug better."
