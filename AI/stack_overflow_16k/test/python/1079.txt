"blank and terminal - strings with special characters i know the blank thing that if i'm using interactive interpreter and i write '\ ' it prints '\ ' but if if i write print '\ ' it prints ' '...what i'm trying to do is (in a script called p.py):..import os.os.system('echo ' + 'string with spaces'.replace(' ', ' '))...obviously it won't let me do this. i mean, blank manages to add two backslashes instead of one but i think it does so only in interactive mode, but the terminal, when passed special chars like , ignores them...so that, as the output of the provious code, i get:..local:$ string with spaces...and not..local:$ string with spaces ...i already tried hardcoded strings and everything else in blank, but i guess the problem is with shell strings...how could i solve this?..it it can help to find alteratives solutions, what i'm trying to do is moving a file from blank with the mv command, and this file has spaces in its name."
