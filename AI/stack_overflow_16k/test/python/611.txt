"belphegor prime number problem with blank i have seen a video about belphegor prime numbers. the definition of a belphegor prime is one such that in the expression (10^(n+3)+666)*(10^(n+1)+1) is prime for n being a positive integer...i tried making a blank program that would determine whether an input number n will produce a prime number in the expression mentioned before but my code said that for all n in the expression would be prime which is not true and it said it indefinitely...my code:..n = int(input(""enter a positive number n: ""))..x =(10**(n+3)+666)*10**(n+1)+1..for i in range(2,x - 1):.    if x % i == 0:.        print(""composite"").    else:.        print(""belphegor prime"")...please help me fix this error!"
