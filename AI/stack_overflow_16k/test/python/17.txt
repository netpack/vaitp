"method that generates unique combinations of numbers i have an array:..a = [0,2,5,6].b = [5,6,8,9].c = [6,7,8,9]...i want to write two functions, below are the details:....problem 1.when i pass in any of the arrays defined above, i get the combinations of numbers on a sequential manner (by sequential meaning, n+1). so the desired outputs are:..resulta = [[0],[2],[5],[6],[5,6]].resultb = [[5],[6],[8],[9],[5,6],[8,9]].resultc = [[6],[7],[8],[9],[6,7],[7,8],[8,9],[6,7,8],[7,8,9],[6,7,8,9]]...below is what i've tried:..sorted_ids = sorted(number_collection).combinations = [sorted_ids[j: j + i] for i in range(1, len(sorted_ids)) for j in range(len(sorted_ids) - i + 1)]...the issue is it works for the array c but doesn't work that well with the others.....problem 2.the result of the problem 1 is the input of for this problem. the thing is i want the combinations that exist on unique elements for the numbers. (i am not sure i can explain it in words properly), below is the desired output:..finalresulta = [[0],[2],[5,6]].finalresultb = [[5,6],[8,9]].finalresultc = [[6,7,8,9]]...is there any approaches (performance oriented) that i can use that'll help?"
