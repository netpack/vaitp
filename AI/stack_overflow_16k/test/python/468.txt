"blank web app to open windows explorer through heroku server i am trying to create a blank / flask webapp which takes a query equal to a dropbox directory, then opens windows explorer to that location. it works on a local machine but i need it to work on my heroku server...i have tried using %homepath% / ""dropbox directory"" which works when i copy and paste into the directory...@app.route(""/"", methods=[""get"",""post""]).def redirect_url():.    url = request.args.get('url').    hp = str(path.home()).    path = path(hp + url)..    string = r'explorer ""{}""'.format(path).    print(string).    subprocess.popen(string).    return ""success""...when something like domain.com/?url=""dropbox directory"" the app should open windows explorer to that location...the above code runs fine on the local system. but path.home returns the app folder"
