"how do i clear a variable after an if statement? i'm implementing a game which allows two players to pick alternately from a pile of 27 sticks.  each player may take 1, 2, or 3 sticks on each turn; the player forced to take the final stick loses...i've done most of the code, but i must include validation. besides taking 1-3 sticks, a player is not allowed to take the final stick. i've tried using a continue statement, but when player two exceeds the limit, the program returns to player 1's turn...here's what i have so far:..count = 27.t = false.f = false..while count &gt; 1:..  playerone = int(input(""player 1's turn, enter from 1-3"")).  if playerone &lt; 1 or playerone &gt; 3:.    print(""error"").    continue.  count -= playerone.  print(count)..  if count == 1:.    print(""p1 wins"").    break..  if count &lt; 1:.    print(""you can't pick up those many sticks"").    continue..  playertwo = int(input(""player 2's turn, enter from 1-3"")).  if playertwo &lt; 1 or playertwo &gt; 3:.    print(""error"").    continue..  count -= playertwo.  print(count)..  if count == 1:.    print(""p2 wins"").    break..  if count &lt; 1:.    print(""you can't pick up those many sticks"").    continue...the last if statement is the issue..help would be much appreciated,"
