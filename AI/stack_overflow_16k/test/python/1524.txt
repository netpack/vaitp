"blank conceptual query i'm just starting to learn blank. i'm stuck upon a problem. kindly clear my doubt...a='abc'.b='abc'.a==b                 #when i run this o/p is true. but, in c/c++ or java it turns out to be false because the variables(a &amp; b) refer to different memories...a is b               #when i run this o/p is true. ok understood , but........but when..a=[1,2,3].b=[1,2,3].a==b                #the out put is true..a is b              #the output is false...what is the reason for the two different outputs in the case of strings and lists?"
