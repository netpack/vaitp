"pounds to metric blank program def poundstometric(pounds):.    kilograms = pounds / 2.2.    grams = kilograms * 1000.    return int(kilograms), grams % 1000..pounds = float(input(""how many pounds? "")).kg, g = poundstometric(pounds).print('the amount of pounds you entered is {}. '.      'this is {} kilograms and {} grams.'.format(pounds, kg, g))...this program works but i am wondering how do i get the kilograms to be only even with decimal points so instead of 65 pounds being like 545.4544545454 grams i need it to be 545 grams"
