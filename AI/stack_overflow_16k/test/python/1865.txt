"converting blank statement into string i got a situation i have to generate a if condition based on item configured in my configuration json file...so once the if statement converted into a string i want that to run by eval ...this is what i am trying for that..here is what flags and set_value look like ..my json .. ""email_condition"":.        {.           ""toxic_thresold"":""50"",.           ""toxic_platform_today"":""0"",.           ""toxic_prs_today"":""0"",.           ""explanation"":""select any or all 1 for toxic_thresold 2 for toxic_platform 3 for toxic_prs "",.           ""condition_type"":[""1"",""2""]..        },.        ""email_list"":{.          ""cc"":[""abc@def.t""],.          ""to"":[""abc@def.net""].        }...the blank ..condition_type is a variable where values can be either all, any or 1,2 ,2,3, or 1,3.1 stands for toxic index 2 for platform and 3  for toxic prs ..but  the idea is going forward any number of parameters can be added so i wanted to make the if condition generic so that can take any number of conditions simply just wanted to avoid to many if else. all and any i have already handaled its straight forward but this is  variable number so only else part snippet given..flags['1'] = toxic_index.flags['2'] = toxic_platform.flags['3'] = toxic_prs..set_value['1'] = toxic_index_condition.set_value['2'] = toxic_platform_condition.set_value['3'] = toxic_pr_condition....   else:.       condition_string = 'if '.       for val,has_more in lookahead(conditions):.           if has_more:.               condition_string = str(condition_string+ str(flags[val] &gt;= set_value[val])+ str('and') ).           else:..               condition_string = str(condition_string+ str(flags[val] &gt;= set_value[val]) + str(':') ).       print str(condition_string)...i do understand that most of them are variable so i am getting the response like ..if false and false:...instead of false i wanted to get the real condition(basically like condition_string+ str(flags[val] &gt;= set_value[val])  ) based on that i can send mail...i am not able to do that as i am getting false and false...please suggest me a best solution for it."
