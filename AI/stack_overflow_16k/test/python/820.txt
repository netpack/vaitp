"blank program that is given a line read from a text file and displays the one number found def extracttemp():.    inputfile = open('p2text.txt','r+')..    line = inputfile.readline()..    for chr in line:.        if chr.isdigit():.            print(chr).            inputfile.close()..extracttemp()...the text file has the number 95 in it, but it prints as:..9 .5...i'm guessing because it is iterating over each character and makes 95 two separate characters. ..so my question is, how do i combine them. or, what can i do to make this program run better? ..bc a big hole in finding the solution to combining the numbers is, what happens when there are two separate numbers like 95 and 90. ..then that would become 9590 if i linked everything together. so what can i do to make this work? ..basically, if given a sentence in a text file a sentence that says ""i have the number 95 and 90"" i want to be able to print just those two integers and ignore the rest. but the way i'm doing it, it would print 9,5,9,0 on separate lines. ..so i'm just wondering how to print them together as in 95 is 95 and not 9,5 and 90 is 90 not 9,0. so the end result i want from reading that sentence is: >> 95 90 after running the program or, if i can only get a sentence that says ""i have the number 95"" and for it to print: >> 95 i'd be happy with that too"
