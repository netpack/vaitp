"what next after 'dive into blank' i've been meaning to learn another language than java.  so i started to poke around with blank.  i've gone over 'dive into blank' so i have a decent knowledge about blank now. ..where do you suggest i go from here? i dont want to go through another advanced book again and would like to use the blank knowledge towards building 'something'. ..i've heard that blank is good for web crawling, however, i did not see that in dive into blank.  can the community suggest how to use my blankg knowledge towards web crawlers or spiders?"
