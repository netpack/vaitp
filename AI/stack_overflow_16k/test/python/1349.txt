"how to tell a class method which variable should be processed sorry for the noob question. lets say i have a class which holds 3 lists and a method to combine one of the lists to a string. how can i tell the method which list it should take ? or should i move the method out of the class into a function ?..here is what i mean:..class images():.    def __init__(self, lista, listb, listc):.        self.lista=lista.        self.listb=listb.        self.listc=listc..    def makelist(self):.        items = """".        for item in self.whateverlistiwant:.            items=items+item.        return items..test=images([1,2,3],[""b""],[""c""]).print (test.makelist(whichlistiwant))"
