"write/read files: nodejs vs blank i need to know what mechanism is more efficient (less ram/cpu)  to read and write files, especially write. possibly a json data structure. the idea is perform these operations in a context of websockets (client -> server -> read/write file with data of the actual session -> response to client).... best idea is to store the data in temporal variables and destroy vars when are not useful?..any idea?"
