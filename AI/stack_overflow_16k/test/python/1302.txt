"targeting one word in the response of an input command blank i have been trying to make an artificial intelligence on blank. what i have been trying to do is make input command responses target one word. so for example, if the user types in ""whats your name"" it will have the same response as ""name"" by targeting the word ""name"". how can i do this?"
