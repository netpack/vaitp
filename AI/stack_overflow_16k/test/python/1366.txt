"blank pinging -t i have a batch program that simply pings in loop with 'ping adress -t'. adress being whatever i'm trying to ping at the time...i'd like to do something similiar with blank, but without the popup of a command prompt window and thus i'd like to avoid anything that would do this. i want a way to print it only to the blank window, so i can use it in my tkinter program...this is what i would originially thought would work, and it does, but i want the output to be in the blank window, not in the command prompt...import subprocess.subprocess.call([""ping"", ""google.com"", ""-t""])"
