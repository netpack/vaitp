"how to find fibonacci sequence by using blank my code is 80% right but there are 2 tests i cant pass...here is my code ..import math.def fib(n):.    a,b = 1,1.    for i in range(n-1):.        a,b = b,a+b.    return a...is right when i test fib(100)..but there are one more requirement is time. so here is my test ..# this should run in less than 5 seconds.print(fib(10 ** 6) % 10 ** 10)...is should under 5 second but my code speed like 10sec to run it...# this should run in less than 10 seconds.print(math.floor(math.log10(fib ( 5 * 10 ** 6 ))))...so how to improve my code to run these two tests under 10 seconds...any suggestion will be glad :)"
