"write a blank code to evaluate the recursive formula in a game where each turn is made up of the roll of a die, player e gets one point when the die is even, and player o gets one point when the die is odd. the first player to accumulate 7 points wins the pot. suppose the die is fair and the game is interrupted with e leading 4−2. write blank 3 code to evaluate the recursive formula to determine the fraction of money that e gets in the above situation where p = 0.5, e = 4, o = 2 and m = 7. write down e’s proportion. ..from the problem given, we can derive that p = 0.5, m = 7, e = 4, o = 2. let a be the event player e is winning where m - e = 3 rounds from winning and b be the event player o is winning m - o = 5 rounds from winning. p(a,b) = p.p(a-1,b) + (1-p)p(a,b-1) with boundary p(0,k)=1, p(k,0) = 0 for all positive integer k. hence, the general recursive formula will be p(m-e, m-o) = p.p(m-e-1,m-o) + (1-p)p(m-e, m-o-1)$ in terms of $p, m, e, o...however, i am unsure of how to translate from this mathematical formula i derived into a blank code?"
