"delete multiple object inside list with pop i've a json object full of properties where some of them are randomly repeated. i want to remove those repeated ones based on the ""word"" index and only keep the first occurrence as in the example:..{ ""word"" : ""apple"", ""meaning"" : ""first meaning"" },.{ ""word"" : ""ball"", ""meaning"" : "" u090fu0909u091fu093e"" },.{ ""word"" : ""cat"", ""meaning"" : "" u090fu0909u091fu093e"" },.{ ""word"" : ""apple"", ""meaning"" : ""repeated, but has another meaning"" },.{ ""word"" : ""doll"", ""meaning"" : "" u090fu0909u091fu093e"" },...i'm a blank beginner and am not able to come up ahead of this solution so far:..#!/usr/bin.import json..source=""/var/www/dictionary/repeated.json"".destination=""/var/www/dictionary/corrected.json""..def remove_redundant():..    with open(source, ""r"") as src:      .        src_object = json.load(src)..        for i in xrange(len(src_object)):..            escape = 1..            for j in xrange(len(src_object)):..                if src_object[j][""word""] == src_object[i][""word""]:..                    # leave the first occurance.                    if escape == 1:.                        escape = 2.                        continue.                    else:.                        src_object.pop(j)..    # open(destination, ""w+"").write(json.dumps(src_object, sort_keys=true, indent=4, separators=(',', ': ')))..    src.close()..remove_redundant()...the error that i keep getting is indexerror: list index out of range because the len is changing constantly. thanks for any help."
