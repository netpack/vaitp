"blank reading text file i have a text file, of which i need each column, preferably into a dictionary or list, the format is :..n       id   remain        vers          .2 2343333   bana           twelve    .3 3549287   moredp       twelve        .3 9383737   hinsila           twelve           .3 8272655   hinsila           eight        ...i have tried:..crs = open(""file.txt"", ""r"").for columns in ( raw.strip().split() for raw in crs ):  .    print columns[0]...result = 'out of index error'..also tried:..crs = csv.reader(open(file.txt"", ""r""), delimiter=',', quotechar='|', skipinitialspace=true).    for row in crs:.                   for columns in row:.                             print columns[3]...which seems to read each char as a column, instead of each 'word'..i would like to get the four columns, ie:..2.2343333.bana.twelve...into seperate dictionaries or lists..any help is great, thanks!"
