"how to read and assign to variable/list multiple text files? i have multiple files, let's say data{1..10}.txt in folder data/..i need to read these files into blank environment for further use, example code i have in mind is:...chr_list = []..x = 0.for item in range(10):.    datafile=""data/data""+str(i+1)+"".txt"".    chr_list[x] = open(datafile, ""r"").    x += 1...the expected outcome would be..print(chr_list[0])..#prints out content of file data/data1.txt...this code doesn't work even after correcting all possible errors. thus, i would like to see some examples on how to reach my desired outcome."
