"how to get the values in a list as column names or groupby over 2 columns i have one big data frame, in which i have multiple columns. column names are for example customer, article, amount bought per transactionid. i would like to get for each customer and each article the sum of the amount bought...what i tried first was grouping by the customer and getting the sum of the amount bought. but this didn't include the article. ..an idea of the data frame: ..transactionid=['1','2','3','4','5'].customerid=['2','4','2','4','5'].articleid=['10','10','10','6','2'].amount =['3','2','1','5','2'].df=pd.dataframe().df['transaction']=transactionid.df['customer'] = customerid.df['article']= articleid.df['amount'] = amount.df...what i would like to get is:.for each unique customer (as row index), the amount of products they bought (sum of amount) for each article (as column).picture..any ideas are welcome, i just need a data frame where i can find per customer per article the amount of products they bought. .i also tried a double for loop:..for i in df.article.unique():.    for j in df.customer.unique():.        sum(df['amount'])...but then i will need to add it to a dataframe, which i can't manage in blank. (more used to r). ..i am stuck, can someone help me?..edit: my first try was creating a unique article list and a unique customer list, where with a dataframe i could give the customerlist, but then i would have to find a way to: 'for every item in article list, create a new column'"
