"make list of dictionary as a value for key of dictionary i have following list of dictionaries...p = [ {""id"": ""47"",""name"": ""l"",""cate"": ""gd31"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""l""},.     {""id"": ""58"",""name"": ""k"",""cate"": ""gd33"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""k""},.    {""id"": ""40"",""name"": ""j"",""cate"": ""gd35"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""j""},.    {""id"": ""15"",""name"": ""i"",""cate"": ""gd37"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""i""},.    {""id"": ""39"",""name"": ""h"",""cate"": ""gd39"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""h""},.    {""id"": ""75"",""name"": ""g"",""cate"": ""ld31"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""g""},.    {""id"": ""12"",""name"": ""f"",""cate"": ""ld33"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""d""},.    {""id"": ""92"",""name"": ""e"",""cate"": ""ld35"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""e""},.    {""id"": ""42"",""name"": ""d"",""cate"": ""ld37"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""d""},.    {""id"": ""11"",""name"": ""c"",""cate"": ""ld39"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""c""},.    {""id"": ""51"",""name"": ""b"",""cate"": ""sww"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""b""},.    {""id"": ""13"",""name"": ""a"",""cate"": ""smm"",""mark"": 0,""code"": ""a""} ]...in the above dictionary, i want to store the particular dictionary to some variable based on the ""cate"" value equal to gd31 or ld31. what i have tried is:..if any(d['cate'] == 'gd31' or d['cate'] == 'ld31'  for d in p):.     print('d31 present')...in the above code, i only check whether gd31 or ld31 is present or not. i need to store the particular dictionary (where ""cate"" value equal to gd31 or ld31) in some variable and also update that selected dictionaries like following: ..new = [ { 'gd31':[{""id"":""47"",""name_g"":'l'}],.          'ld31':[{""id"":""75"",""name_l"":'g'}] }  ]...explanation: if both gd31 and ld31 are present, then make gd31 and ld31 as a key and ""id, name"" as values then update ""name"" to ""name_g"" for gd31 and ""name"" to ""name_l"" for ld31...i expect the result as:..       new = [ { 'gd31':[{""id"":""47"",""name_g"":'l'}],.               'ld31':[{""id"":""75"",""name_l"":'g'}] }  ]...explanation: ..if d31 is found, select that particular dictionary alone from the list of dictionaries. in that particular dictionary take ""id"" and ""name"". hence, gd31 and ld31 is a key and ""id, name"" are values. .and if d31 is found, update ""name"" as ""name_g"" for gd31 and ""name_l"" for ld31..***and this is for all values d33, d35, d37 and d39..i hope you all understand. any idea please?"
