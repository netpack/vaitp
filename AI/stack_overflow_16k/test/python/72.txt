"list all third party packages and theirselves functions used in a blank file i have many blank packages, wrote by my colleagues and i want to write a tool to check which third packages they rely on. ..like this .. #it is my package, need to check,call it example.py. #we have more than one way to import a package, it is a problem need to consider too.. from third_party_packages import third_party_function.. def my_function(arg):.    return third_party_function(arg)...and the tool should work like this ..result = tool(example.py).#this result should be a dict like this structure.#{""third_party_function"":[""my_function"",]}.#means ""my_function"" relies on ""third_party_function""...i have no idea how to do that, all i can come up implementation of this tool is read a blank file line by one line as string, and use regex to compare it..could you give me some advises?..if you don't know what i mean, please comment. your question, i will fix it as soon as possible.. thanks!"
