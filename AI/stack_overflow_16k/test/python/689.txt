"handling text menu in blank i am trying to create a text based menu in blank. ..here is the code:..#!/usr/bin/env blank..def testcaseoutput():..    print '1. add. 2. subtract. 3. divide. 4. multiply'..    try:.        answer = int(raw_input('enter a value (1 - 4) &gt;. ')) .    except valueerror:.        print 'invalid input. enter a value between 1 -4 .'.        testcaseoutput()..    if answer in range(1, 5):.        return answer.    else:.        print 'invalid input. enter a value between 1 - 4.'.        testcaseoutput()...my question:..when the user enters an invalid input, i.e. not a number, i want this function to get called again. so i used the recursive approach which i think is bad design. i use that approach again in the ..if answer in range(1, 5). ...is there any other way to handle this? i need the prompt called again when there is an invalid input...also, is there any way i can club the two constraints: check whether input is a number and check whether the number is in the range(1,5) together? as you can see, i am checking that individually."
