"printing on the same line as a header in blank i am writing a function calculate a score for the matrix and output the score along with some other variables as a header. my code for output is as follows:..header=""&gt;""+motif+"" ""+gene+"" ""+str(score).append_copy = open(newpwmfile, ""r"").original_text = append_copy.read().append_copy.close().append_copy = open(newpwmfile, ""w"").append_copy.write(header).append_copy.write(original_text).append_copy.close()...however the header is printing the score on the next line instead of the same line, as follows:..    &gt;atgc abc/cdf.     5.8.     0.23076923076923   0   0.69230769230769    0.076923076923077.     0.46153846153846   0.23076923076923    0.23076923076923  0.076923076923077.     0  0   1   0.     0  1   0   0.     1  0   0   0...what could be the reason? i also tried interchanging the variables and then the header is printed on the same line. however the sequence is relevant in this case."
