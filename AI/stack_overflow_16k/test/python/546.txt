"share files and functions through multiple projects it's a kind of open question but please bear with me..i am working on several projects (mainly with pandas) and i have created my standard approach to manage them:. 1. create a main folder for all files in a project. 2. create a data folder. 3. have all the output in another folder.and so on. ..one of my main activities is data cleaning, and in order to standardize it i have created a dictionary file where i store the various translation of the same entity, e.g. usa, us, united states, and so on, so that the files i am producing are consistent...every time i create a new project, i copy the dictionary file in the data directory and then:..xls = pd.excelfile(r""data/dictionary.xlsx"").df_area = xls.parse(""area"")...and after, to translate the country name into my standard, i call:..join_column, how_join = ""country"",  ""inner"".df_ct = pd.concat([.    df_ct.merge(df_area, left_on=join_column, right_on=""country_name"", how=how_join),.    df_ct.merge(df_area, left_on=join_column, right_on=""alternative01"", how=how_join),...and finally i check that i am not losing an record with a miss-join..over and over the same thing...i would like to have a way to remove all this unnecessary cut and paste (of the file and of the code). also, the file i used on the first projects are already deprecated and i need to update them (and sometime the code) when i need to process new data. sometimes i also lose track of where is the latest dictionary file! overall it's a lot of maintenance, which i believe might be saved..creating my own package is the way to go or is it a little too much ambitious? .is there another shortcut? overall it's not a lot of code, but multiplied by several projects...thanks for any insight, your time going through this is appreciated."
