"blank rock paper scissors counter i'm building a rock paper scissors game and i would like to add a counter to the code i already have. ..i want to count wins, losses and ties, and print these when the player does not want to play anymore...this code does just about everything else i set out to do. i have seen a few other ideas on the site, but none of them seem to be adaptable to my code. any ideas?.here is the code:    ..import random..def rock(rand):..    if rand == (1):.        print(""tie game!"").    elif rand == (2):.        print(""your rock got covered by opponent's paper. you lose!"").    elif rand == (3):.        print(""you crushed the opponent's scissors with your rock! you win!"").        print(""good game!"")..def paper(rand):..    if rand == (1):.        print(""you covered opponent's rock with your paper. you win!"").        print(""good game!"").    elif rand == (2):.        print(""tie game!"").    elif rand == (3):.        print(""your opponent cut your paper with its scissors. you lose!"")..def scissors(rand):..    if rand == (1):.        print(""your opponent's rock crushed your scissors. you lose!"").    elif rand == (2):.        print(""your scissors cut opponent's paper. you win!"").        print(""good game!"").    elif rand == (3):.        print(""tie game!"")..def main():..    name = input(""what is your name? "")..    print(""hello, "" + name + ""! i'm a rock paper scissors game."")..    while true:.        choice = input(""would you like to play? (yes/no) "").upper()[0].        if choice == ""n"":.            print(""let's play later!"").            break.        elif choice == ""y"":.            print(""ok, lets play!"").            print(""rules: rock breaks scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock. "").            raw = input(""choose rock, paper, or scissors "").upper().            try:.                answer = raw[0].            except:.                indexerror.                print(""illegal input! exiting."").                break...            rand = random.randint(1, 3)  # 1 = rock, 2 =paper 3 = scissors.            if answer == ""s"":.                scissors(rand).            elif answer == ""p"":.                paper(rand).            elif answer == ""r"":.                rock(rand).            else:.                print(""enter a valid answer!"").main()"
