"odd clicking noise while attempting to play a sound in blank while working on a simple little timer i was creating to simultaneously help me learn more about blank and to help me keep on schedule with my schoolwork; i decided to add a little tune to let me know when your time was up. however, after using the following snippet of code to program each individual note:..winsound.beep(freq, dur)...i realized that whenever i actually played the little song, an odd clicking sound happened between each note. does anyone know what's going on? should i use a different expression? am i just losing my mind?..edit: since posting this, i realized what the issue is, the program is waiting about a sixteenth of second in between playing each note. so i'd like to ask another question (any answers relating to the others would still be appreciated), namely, how can i make it not wait in between the notes...import winsound.winsound.beep(262,500).winsound.beep(277,500).winsound.beep(294,500).winsound.beep(311,500).winsound.beep(330,500).winsound.beep(349,500).winsound.beep(370,500).winsound.beep(392,500).winsound.beep(415,500).winsound.beep(440,500).winsound.beep(466,500).winsound.beep(493,500).winsound.beep(523,500)...all the above code does is play a simple chromatic scale from middle c to c2, but once one runs it, one would immediately see what im talking about"
