"blank datetime and date comparison based on the example i found here i want to grab icalendar data and process it. this my code so far:..from datetime import datetime, timedelta.from icalendar import calendar.import urllib.import time..ics = urllib.urlopen('https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/xy/basic.ics').read().ical1 = calendar.from_ical(ics).for vevent in ical1.subcomponents:.    if vevent.name == ""vevent"":.        title = str(vevent.get('summary').encode('utf-8')).        start = vevent.get('dtstart').dt   # datetime.        end = vevent.get('dtend').dt       # datetime..        print title.        print start.        print end.        print type(start).        print ""---""...it is fetching the title and start+end date from my google calender. this working and the output looks like this:..this is a test title.2012-12-20 15:00:00+00:00.2012-12-20 18:00:00+00:00.&lt;type 'datetime.datetime'&gt;.---.another title.2012-12-10.2012-12-11.&lt;type 'datetime.date'&gt;.---.    ......as you can see the start and end date can be of type datetime.datetime or datetime.date. it depends on whether i have an entry in google calender for 2 whole days (then it is a datetime.date) or for a time period e.g. 3 hours (then it is a datetime.datetime. i need to only print dates/datetimes from today and for the next 4 weeks. i had problems comparing dates and datetimes (its seems like it is not possible) so i failed to do that. how can i compare datetimes and dates conserving the data types? if i need to ""cast"" them, its ok. i was not able to print ""today + 4 weeks"", only ""4 weeks""."
