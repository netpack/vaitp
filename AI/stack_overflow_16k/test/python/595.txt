"blank zip - why do we need to unpack the argument? i'm trying to understand the need to unpack the arguments using * when the input to zip is a 2d list.  the docs state,...  [zip] returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables....so, regarding the second print statement below, i expected it to be just like the ones before and after it.  i am having trouble connecting the description of zip to this result...mwe:                                                                 ..x = [1, 2, 3].y = [4, 5, 6]..print zip(x, y).print zip([x, y])  # don't understand this result.print zip(*[x, y])...result:..[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)].[([1, 2, 3],), ([4, 5, 6],)].[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]"
