"get parents directories of a file, up to a point if i have a path for a given file, say 'c:folderotherfolderanotherfolderfile.txt', is there a way in blank i can get all the parent directories for file.txt up to 'otherfolder'? the depth of the path is not constant, so i can't just iterate back a certain number of times, but i always need to get up to 'otherfolder' regardless of depth. i feel like this should be easier than i'm making it, but they say thursday is the new monday. :)"
