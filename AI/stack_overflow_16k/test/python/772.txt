"how can i make a while loop only run a limited number of times? in the code below, i'd like to run the function roll(), after: deal = input(""your turn: ""), but only up to a limited number of cycles (52)..how can i achieve that?..import random..ydeal = random.randint(1,15).adeal = random.randint(1,15)..yscore = 0.ascore = 0..def roll():.    if deal == ""deal"":.        print(ydeal, adeal).        if ydeal &gt; adeal:.            yscore + 1.        elif ydeal &lt; adeal:.            ascore + 1.        print(yscore, ascore)..deal = input(""your turn: "").roll()...as a side note: i noticed that when printing yscore and ascore the value does not change during the loop, how can i fix that?"
