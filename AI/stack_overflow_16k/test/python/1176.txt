blank: recursively convert int to binary string i am trying to recursively convert int to binary string but i don't really understand how the whole positive int to binary string conversion works...also found out that apparently each position is like a representation of the power of 2...any explanation as to how to convert a positive int to a string representation as shown in the googled example above is extremely helpful.
