"how to make a file transfer program in blank the title might not be relevant for my question becuase i don't actually want a wireless file transfering script, i need a file manager type...i want something with which i can connect my phone with my pc (eg: hotspot and wifi) and then i would like to show text file browser (i have the code for that) by sending lists of all files and folders using os.listdir(), whenever the selected option is a file (os.path.isdir() == false), i would like to transfer the file and run it(like: picture, video, etc)...the file browser code which i wrote runs on windows and also android (after making a few changes) using qblank...my code is..import os.def filebrowser(cwd = os.getcwd()):.  while true:.    if cwd[-1:] != ""\"":.      cwd = cwd + ""\"".    files = os.listdir(cwd).    count = 1.    tmpp = """".    print(""nn"" + ""_""*50 +""nn"").    print(cwd + ""n"").    for f in files:.      if os.path.isdir(cwd + f) == true:.        s1 = str(count) + "". "" + f.        tmps1 = 40 - (len(s1)+5).        t2 = int(tmps1/3).        s1 = s1 + "" "" * t2 + ""-"" * (tmps1 - t2).        print(s1 + ""&lt;dir&gt;"").      else:.        print(str(count) + "". "" + f + tmpp).      count = count + 1.    s = raw_input(""enter the file/directory: "").    if s == ""..."":.      tmp1 = cwd.count(""\"").      tmp2 = cwd.rfind(""\"").      if tmp1 &gt; 1:.        cwd = cwd[0:tmp2].        tmp2 = cwd.rfind(""\"").        cwd = cwd[0:tmp2+1].        continue.      else:.        continue.    else:.      s = int(s) - 1.    if os.path.isdir(cwd + files[s]) == true:.      cwd = cwd + files[s] + ""\"".      continue.    else:.      f1 = files[s].      break.  return f1.def main():.  fb = filebrowser().main()"
