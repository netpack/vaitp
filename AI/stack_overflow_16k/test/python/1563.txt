"cost of building a list from string i need to manipulate a string in blank, for this i'm creating a list of characters from the string, since blank strings are immutable :..str = 'abc'.list(str)...the problem is that the string can contain upto a million characters and i am not sure whether creating a list is slowing the code down or not...what is the complexity of the above task? and is there any better alternative to manipulating strings?"
