"can i save dictionaries as lists? so i am trying to write a board typeish ""game"" in blank. so i have a function place_piece that places a piece at a row and column and then i have another function that checks if a row and column is free or not. it works but if i try to place 2 pieces the second piece overrides the first piece so i can only place one piece at a time. i want to be able to place an unlimited amount of pieces without them overriding each other...here's my code: i say that board = new_board() in the beginning before running the functions..def new_board():.    board = {}.    return board...def is_free(board, x, y):.    x = x.    y = y.    if board[""x""] == x and board[""y""] == y:.        return false.    else:.        return true...def place_piece(board, x, y, player):.    board[""x""] = x.    board[""y""] = y.    board[""player""] = player.    return true...so basically i want to to be able to say place_piece(board,100,200,""player1"") and place_piece(board,300,400,""player1"") and then i want to check if these places are free with is_free(board,100,200) and is_free(board,100,200) and i want both of them to return false as they aren't free...can i somehow save each dictionary in a list or something?"
