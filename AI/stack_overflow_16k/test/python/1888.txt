"blank conventions with respect to if conditions in blank, is it frowned upon to use extra conditions within an if statement to avoid error, or should this be done separately from the if statement?..example:..i want to make sure that d, which will be either a empty string or a number string is not blank and not less than 1. if d is a empty string, it can not be converted to a float. the statement is evaluated as false before trying to convert to float so i don't get an error. is this bad practice?..def main(): .    d = ""2.25"".    check_d(d).    d = ""0"".    check_d(d).    d = """".    check_d(d)...this looks prettier to me..def check_d(d):.    if d and float(d) &gt;= 1:.        return true.    print('d must be defined with value 1 or greater').    return false...this was my first instinct..def check_d_old(d):.    try:.        if float(d) &gt;= 1:.            return true.    except:.        pass.    print('d must be defined with value 1 or greater').    return false"
