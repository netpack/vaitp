"evaluating a formula with the variable changing each time i am trying to evaluate an expression for 4 different values for on of my variables. i am trying do create a for loop using np.arange as my variable is a float. ..import numpy as np.for mf in np.arange(0.8,0.01,1.5):.    vinf=mf*(gamma*r*tatm)**0.5.    print(mf)...i want to evaluate the above expression for mf = 0.8, 0.9, 1.2 and 1.5. i simply don't know how to do this or using a for loop is even appropriate. finally, i want to save the output vinf in an array. how could i achieve all of this?..edit:..ok i got the above code working thanks to user gmds. i am trying to use the list created for mf_values to be used in the expression for p0 in my code. i have tried it in the following way:..mf_values=[0.8, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5].vinf_values=[mf_value*(gamma*r*tatm)**0.5 for mf_value in mf_values].print(vinf_values).p0=[(1+((gamma-1)/2)*(mf_values**2)**(gamma/(gamma-1))].print(p0).t0=(1+((gamma-1)/2)*(mf_values**2))*tatm...i want to use the 4 different mf_values for solving the expression for p0 and t0 and save the results in a list in a similar fashion to vinf_values. however, blank gives me the following error:..    p0=[(1+((gamma-1)/2)*(mf_values**2)**(gamma/(gamma-1))].                                                      ^.syntaxerror: invalid syntax...how do i solve this issue?"
