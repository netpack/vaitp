"making a new list that returns the minimum value digits' position/index from the previous list make a function called positions_lowest(lorig1), with at least one element,  with integer numbers, possibly repeated,  and returns a new list (lpos) containing the positions where the minimum number is in the original list...for example:..lorig=[10,2,-3,34.5, 22,-3,1].lres = positions_lowest(lorig).print(lres).# gives the output:.[2, 5] # because the minimum digit is -3 and positions are 2 and 5...i tried many times fixing my code and it is becoming more and more complicated for this simple question, below is my code. it does not even execute..def positions_lowest(lorig):.    lpos = [].    if lorig:.        min_val = lorig[0].        [(i,j) for i,val in enumerate(lorig) if j &lt; min_val].        if j == min_j:.            lpos.append(i).        else: .            min_val = j.            lpos = [i].        return lpos"
