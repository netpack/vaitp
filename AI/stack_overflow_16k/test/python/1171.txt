"blank: wait for a key press or until timeout i have a long-running blank script inside a terminal session (the host machine is a freebsd box) that performs a task every 9 minutes. now, i'd like to be able to interrupt that sleep call at any moment so that it performs the task right away...how can i do that? catching ctrl+c is not an option as i need it to stop the program (rather than merely interrupting the sleep). anything else that i can do with a terminal window and a keyboard is fine."
