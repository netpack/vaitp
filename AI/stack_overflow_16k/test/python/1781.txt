"blank - ending for loop if there is no new entry following this post: blank - reading chunks and break if there is no lines..i've been told that this piece of code is already reading chunk of lines at a time:..file = open('logfile.txt', 'r').count = 0  .while 1:.   where = file.tell().   for line in file:       .       if not line:.           count = count + 1.           if count &gt;= 10:.               break.           time.sleep(1).           file.seek(where).       else:.           try:.               #process line...if so, then how can the script check if there is no new lines for some time, end the for loop and continue the script? i treid counting for some time but that doesn't work"
