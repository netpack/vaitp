"one of my else statements in blank doesn´t work. i´m trying to make a textbased game. what the else statement is supposed to do is if the player doesn´t type in an item they have it tells them so, then restarts the method. what really happens is when i run the code is that i get an invalid syntax for my troubles. the else statement has a * next to it. ..def fightmode():.      action=raw_input(""type a to attack, s to pick an item, d to runaway.then hit enter"").      if action==""s"":.        pickitem().      elif action == ""a"":..def isprime():.  defense=10.  strength=10.  health= 10.  items={""shepards crow"":strength+2 and defense+2}.  equipeditems=[].  print(""you're quietly herding the village's sheep when you suddenly hear a huge roar. goblns have invaded the village and are coming towards you. do you a.runaway b.fight c.herd the sheep away"").  answer=rawinput(""type your option a,b, or c and press enter"")..def pickitem():.  itempick=raw_input(""type in your item and press enter"").  for x in items:.    if itempick == x:.      equipeditems=[x].      print(""% equiped"" %itempick).    fightmode().    *else:.      print(""item unavailable. try again"").      pickitem()*..def print():.  print(""health= %"" %health).#this is enacted when you get into a fight"
