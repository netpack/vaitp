"receiving api calls in blank i am looking for a way to run a blank program that listens to calls from other another blank program. i tried it through the http protocol, but it's very slow when heavily used. is it possible to listen to memory entries that another blank program writes? or another solution?.sending and retrieving calls happens on the same machine...like i set up a while loop that never ends and every time looks into a file and reads it...i guess database software like google's leveldb and mongodb use the same method...edit:.there can be several calls at once and the script is running all the time."
