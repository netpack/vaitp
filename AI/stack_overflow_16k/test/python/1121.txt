"mastermind problems i've made the game mastercode and i am having troubles getting the computer to tell the user which numbers they got correct and incorrect..my code is listed below, along with the attempt i used for getting the computer to print the correct answers. if someone could tell me what i am doing wrong and point me in the right direction, that would be great...import random.def mastermind():  .    password = ""%05d"" % random.randint(0, 99999) #the computer chooses 5 random numbers.    for tries in range(10):.        userguess = raw_input(""guess my 5 digit password to access the treasure:"") .        if password == userguess: .            print ""win on the %d try"" % (tries + 1) .            hint(password, userguess) .            break #terminates the ongoing loop and executes next statement.    print ""answer was:"", password #tells computer to print the password..def hint(password, guess): #function of the hints.     for i in range(5): #the range within the five integers.        if guess[i] == password[i]: #if the user's integer aligns with computers integer then an 'x' should appear.           print 'x',.           continue.        if guess[i] in answer: #if don't have corresponding number then an 'o' will appear.           print 'o',"
