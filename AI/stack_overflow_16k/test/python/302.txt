"auto updating attributes using properties for large objects i am trying to auto-update some properties of a class objects attribute. for example the shape of a pandas dataframe needs to be auto updated whenever the data frame is modified. i tried using the property getter setter functions inspired from https://stackoverflow.com/a/14916491/10100377,  but it creates a copy of existing dataframe to prevent recursion issues. what methods can be adopted to auto update properties without having a duplicate copy. in cases of large dataframes, it is costly to have duplication."
