"blank accessor and mutator methods i am trying to solve a blank question that was described as follows:...  design a class that holds the following personal data: name, address,.  age, and phone number. write appropriate accessor and mutator methods..  also, write a program that creates three instances of the class. one.  instance should hold your information, and the other two should hold.  your friends’ or family members’ information....i am stumped on where to go from here. i think i have 90% correct but i am missing the main function code. my code is as follows:..class person:.    def __init__(self, name, address, age, phone):.        self.__name = name.        self.__address = address.        self.__age = age.        self.__phone_number = phone..    #set methods.    def set_name(self,name):.        self.__name = name   .    def set_address(self,address):.        self.__address = address.    def set_age(self,age):.        self.__age = age.    def set_phone(self,phone):.        self.__phone = phone...    #get methods.    def get_name(self):.        reurn self.__name.    def get_address(self):.        reurn self.__address      .    def get_age(self):.        reurn self.__age.    def get_phone(self):.        reurn self.__phone..def main():..#not sure what to put here?????..main()"
