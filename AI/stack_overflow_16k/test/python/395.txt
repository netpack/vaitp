"read file in blank from specific file i have a big log file, and i want to read the relevant part from this log. ..every section start with ###start log###, so i need to search the last occurrence of ###start log###, and read the lines until the end of the file...i see a solution that can search a line by it seek (number), but i don't know it, i know only the content of the line...what is the best solution for this case?"
