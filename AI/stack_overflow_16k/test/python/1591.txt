"average from a list in blank i have a list of values ​​in blank who change between positive and negative values, and i want to work with the average of those values. however, i need initialize a counter when the number was positive and end the counting before it becomes positive again, on the last negative number. then, take the average of this counting...here is my sample data:..   0;  2.3360; 0.4675.   1;  1.7439; 0.4174.   2;  1.3766; 0.3673.   3;  1.3766; 0.1719.   4;  1.4002; 0.1719.   5;  1.5687; 0.1719.   6;  2.2238; -0.6552.   7;  1.6181; -0.6552.   8;  2.2797; -0.6552.   9;  2.9562; -0.6552.  10;  3.4301; -0.6552.  11;  3.7597; -0.6552.  12;  4.0999; -0.6552.  13;  4.6294; -0.6552.  14;  4.4860; -0.6552.  15;  4.4504; 0.0356.  16;  4.3090; 0.1414.  17;  3.9967; 0.1556.  18;  3.8269; 0.1698.  19;  3.4952; 0.1978.  20;  3.2694; 0.1307.  21;  3.2059; 0.0635.  22;  3.1428; 0.0631.  23;  3.0802; 0.0626.  24;  2.9562; -0.0619.  25;  2.8950; -0.0612.  25;  2.8950; -0.0612.  26;  2.4214; -0.1155.  27;  2.2517; -0.1697.  28;  2.0055; -0.1900.  29;  1.7952; -0.1835.  30;  1.7952; 0.1835...in this case, i would need make the average from the value on the 0 position until the value on the 14 position, after, from the 15 until the 29, and from the 30 until the end...however, this average is relative from the values on the second column, vazmed[1], but the range for this average, len(n), will variate with the third column, vazmed[2]..i'm tryna do this with an auxiliary variable, but, without success...here is what i did until now: ..arq = open('vazdif.out', 'rt')..vazmed1 = [].vazmed2 = []..i = 0..for row in arq:.    field = row.split(';').    vaz1 = float(field[1]).    vaz2 = float(field[2]).    vazmed1.append(vaz1).    vazmed2.append(vaz2).    i = i+1.n = len(vazmed1).m = sum(vazmed1).aux = 0.for actual in vazmed2:.    if actual &lt; 0:.        aux = 1.    if actual &gt;= 0 and aux == 1:.        aux = 0.    if aux == 1:.        average = m/n.        print(average)...if anybody could help me, and also explain where am i going wrong, i will be grateful."
