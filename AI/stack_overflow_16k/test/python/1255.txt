"a better way to extract data in blank i have some code that gets the lecture times from online courses i take. the resulting answer is in the form of [['02:29']]. i think i'd use the following code to get the number out: ..time1=timelist[0].time2=time1[0].time3=(time2.contents[0]).(parts) = time3.split("":"")...is there a better way to do this in fewer steps? and what resources are there to help me in the future? or is this one of those things you just learn by coding and then asking for help?"
