"how to print in one line the outputs of two lists? i have two lists a: contains number from 1 to 10, and b contains percentage values..i'd like to print them in this way ...  1: 10%, 2: 40%, 3: 50%...i managed to write only one array but i can't find a way to write both of them. ..print(' : '.join(str(x) for x in a))...i tested zip but it printed only the first value of a and the rest of b..print(''.join(str(x) + "" : "" + str(y) for x, y in zip(a, b)))....  0 : 2821 : 3422 : 2963 : 3024 : 3155 : 2496 : 3067 : 3198 : 2729 : 317...any idea how to implement it without using for loop ?"
