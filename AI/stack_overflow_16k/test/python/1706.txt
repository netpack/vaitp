"why does my blank code keep returning ""invalid mode."" with proper input? so i'm making a simple timer program to get better at blank since i've never really tried it before. with my limited knowledge of the language, i don't feel i'm qualified to diagnose this issue myself. i tried changing double quotes to single quotes around my ""if mode =="" statements, but that didn't change anything. i keep getting ""invalid mode."", which is my error message for when it's not up or down...here is my code:..import time..seconds = 0.mode = ""down""..def main():.    print(""timer v1.0 by alexis knox"").    time.sleep(1).    seconds = int(input(""seconds to count: "")).    mode = str(input(""timer mode [up/down]: ""))..    if mode != 'up':.        print(""invalid mode."").        exit(0).    if mode != 'down':.        print(""invalid mode."").        exit(0)..    if seconds &lt; 1:.        print(""invalid time."").        exit(0)..    if mode == 'up':.        for x in range(seconds):.            x += 1.            print(str(x)).            time.sleep(1)..    if mode == 'down':.        y = seconds.        for y in range(seconds):.            y -= 1.            print(str(y)).            time.sleep(1)....# ensure that we execute main.if __name__ == ""__main__"":.    main()"
