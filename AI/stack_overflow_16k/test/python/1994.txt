"asynchronous file downloads in blank i'm trying to find a way to download multiple files asynchronously in blank(2.6) preferably via requests module. gevent and twisted will also be acceptable as i'll be learning them in the near future...my application requires the download of 40+ files in a short period of time, i want to continuously download all the files 4 at a time. and every-time one file download completes another one is started so it stays at 4..is this possible?"
