"not sure how to turn this into a loop in blank 3 im very new to blank and am a bit stuck. i have a variable called data that is json that i need to access. the problem is i get the json but it has values that end up changing due to the system processing payment information. i need to access the json after its been updated. id like to run a loop that checks that variable...code:..data = json.loads(self.rfile.read( length ).decode('utf-8')).order_status = data['order_status']['name']..if not order_status == ""awaiting payment"":.    data = json.loads(self.rfile.read( length ).decode('utf-8'))...i want a loop that keeps checking order_status-> name and once its no longer saying ""awaiting payment"" set the data variable.im not really sure how to do that"
