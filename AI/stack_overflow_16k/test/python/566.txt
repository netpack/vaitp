"how to define multiple functions changing internal values? i think my question should be more clearly understood by this short code:..fs = [].for k in range(0, 10):.    def f(x):.        return x + 2*k.    fs.append(f).fs[0](1).# expecting 1 but 19(=1+2*9)...how do i instead make f return what i want? please note that f cannot receive k as an argument...(what i'm actually trying to do is prepare multiple constraint functions that are fed to scipy.optimize.minimize)"
