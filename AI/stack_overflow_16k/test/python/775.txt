how do i create a tipping program for blank? i am very new to programming and i am currently learning blank from a book i purchased..at the end of each chapter it has challenges for you to write programs based on what you have learnt in the previous chapter.it is asking to create a program for a user to enter an amount for a restaurant bill and tells them two amounts a  15% and 20% tip but it has not discussed in the book how to work out percentages in blank. i have tried looking online and nothing shows up regarding this. i am sure it is simple to do but i don't won't to carry on further with the book before understanding this.
