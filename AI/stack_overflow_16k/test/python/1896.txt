"creating a text file of list and then re-accessing the text file in some other program. blank i am facing a parsing error i guess but i am not able to correct it...i have a list of numbers in store=[0,3,4,5.....].i want to save these numbers in a text file such that i am able to access this text file and use those numbers as integers only for my next program..the text file should contain numbers like..0.3.4.5...but, when i try to use the code, ..type error: expected a character buffer object....the code which i am trying is:..output_file=open(""bins.txt"",""w"").for r in range(0,len(store)):.    output=store[r].    output_file.write(output).output_file.close()...please guide me on what should i change so that i can access these as integers only in next program and also tell me how can i use it in the next program..thank you"
