"only length-1 arrays can be converted to blank scalars using int function i currently got an array in blank which is an element of a dictionary and, in blank console, looks like this:..tumec['spans'][0].array([0. , 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.])...i want to pass the whole array to a function but this has to go through some simple math operation like:..int(tumec['spans'][0]*100)...but i got the error message saying:.only length-1 arrays can be converted to blank scalars...so, i tried to import numpy and type:..int(tumec['spans'][0]*100)...but i still have the same issue...does anybody know how i can bypass this issue."
