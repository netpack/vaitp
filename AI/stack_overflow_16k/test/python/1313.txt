"loading data from text file from only a part of the file name i have a lot of data in different text files. each file name contains a word that is chosen by me, but they also include a lot of ""gibberish"". so for example i have a text file called datapoints-(my chosen name)-12iu8w9e8v09wr-140-ad92-dw9..so the datapoints string is in all text files, the (my chosen name) is what i define and know how to extract in my code, but the last bit is random. and i don't want to go and delete that part in every text file i have, that would be a bit time consuming. ..i just want to load these text files, but i'm unsure of how to target each file without using the ""gibberish"" in the end. i just want to say something like: ""load file that includes (my chosen name)"" and then not worry about the rest."
