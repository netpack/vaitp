"blank yield multiple assignment i generally try to use yield whenever i can, but i don't get how i'd do it on code like this:..numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]..def odd_and_even(numbers):.    odd = [].    even = [].    for number in numbers:.        if number % 2:.            odd.append(number).        else:.            even.append(number).    return (odd, even)...obviously, in the above case, i could rewrite it as two different functions, but for something more complex, that might be quite computationally expensive because i'd be running twice as many checks...how could the above code be made to use yield?"
