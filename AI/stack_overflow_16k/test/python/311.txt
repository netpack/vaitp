"blank: how to make a function visible throughout a program i have two functions like the following:..def fitnesscompare(x, y):    .    if x.fitness&gt;y.fitness:.        return 1.    elif x.fitness==y.fitness:.        return 0.    else:  #x.fitness&lt;y.fitness.        return -1...that are used with 'sort' to sort on different attributes of class instances...these are used from within other functions and methods in the program...can i make them visible everywhere rather than having to pass them to each object in which they are used?..thanks"
