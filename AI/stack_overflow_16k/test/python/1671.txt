"why import when you need to use the full name? in blank, if you need a module from a different package you have to import it. coming from a java background, that makes sense...import foo.bar...what doesn't make sense though, is why do i need to use the full name whenever i want to use bar? if i wanted to use the full name, why do i need to import? doesn't using the full name immediately describe which module i'm addressing?..it just seems a little redundant to have from foo import bar when that's what import foo.bar should be doing. also a little vague why i had to import when i was going to use the full name."
