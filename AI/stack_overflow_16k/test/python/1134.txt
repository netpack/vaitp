"blank import file with dependencies in the same folder i have a file ref.py that depends on a text file ex.txt, that is in the same directory homeref_dir . so it works normally when i run the file ref.py, but if i try to import ref.py to another file work.py in a different directory homework_dir , i do the following..import sys.sys.path.append('homeref_dir').import ref...but then i get an error, that the program cannot find ex.txt..how can i solve this issue without using absolute paths. any ideas?"
