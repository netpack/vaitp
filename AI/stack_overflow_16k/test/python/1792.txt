"finding difference between two lists and creating a zero-one list i am trying to create a function that takes two list compares them and give back a list which shows where the first list is different from the other one.some examples follows:...example 1:..list1: [1, 2, 3].list2: [1, 3].desired result: [0, 1, 0]     ..example 2..list1: [1, 3, 1, 2, 4].list2: [1, 1, 4].desired result: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]..example 3..list1: [3, 5, 2, 9, 9].list2: [3, 5, 9, 9].desired result: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]..example 4..list1: [1, 1, 1].list2: [1].desired result: [0, 1, 1]..example 5..list1: [1, 2, 2, 1].list2: [1, 2, 1].desired result: [0, 0, 1, 0]....some facts:...list1 is always bigger or equal length with the list2.desired list has the length of the list1.the number of ones in the desired list is equal with the difference of the length of the two lists....my apologies that i do not provide any answer but i can not think of any way to implement this. any guidance/tip?"
