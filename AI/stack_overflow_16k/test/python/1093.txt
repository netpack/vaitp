"why do i keep getting an error message when i run the code saying that 'list' object has no attribute strip? i wrote this code to read a .csv file and then write a new .csv file with all that's exactly the same except it has a sixth row with the integers in columns four and five added together. here is what i wrote ..import csv.def computed_column (x) :.    with open(x, 'r') as f:.        reader = csv.reader(f).        with open('introduce.csv', 'w') as g :.            writer = csv.writer(g).            for line in reader:.                line = line.strip().split(',').                sum1 = str(int(line[3]+line[4])).                writer.writerow(line + ',' + sum1 + 'n' )...everytime i try to run it, i get an error saying that 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'"
