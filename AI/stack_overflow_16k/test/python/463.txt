"order of output changes for heapq.nlarest with a key function (blank) could someone please explain why does the order of output changes when nlargest function is called with a key function with only first arg...import heapq.heap_arr = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (3, 'd')]..heapq.nlargest(2, x).# perfectly fine - op is [(3, 'd'), (3, 'c')].# this is similar to heapq.nlargest(2, x, key=lambda a: (a[0], a[1]))..heapq.nlargest(2, x, key=lambda a: a[0]).# op is [(3, 'c'), (3, 'd')]... why ??...why (3, 'c') is appearing first in the second example before (3, 'd'). the reason behind this question is that order of tuples in the output list is important."
