"write into a blank slice? attempting to simply write into an existing (already filled) slice in blank...data = list([0] * 80).bytes = [72, 101, 108, 108, 111].print len(data) # 80.data[0:] = bytes.print (len(data)) # 5...what i really wanted was to only modify the first 5 integers and leave the rest of the data list as zeros.  however, what i did was shrink my list...what is the right way to copy my bytes into data without shrinking it?"
