"assign variable name to an object when variable is assigned in blank, variable have name while object do not (as several variable can point to the same object)..but is there a way to add/modify the name property of an object when it is assigned to a variable...ideally, something that would work like this:..spam = magicobject().print(spam.name) # output: ""spam"".ham = spam.print(spam.name) # output: ""ham""...edit: in fact, i don't really mind if the second printing is ""ham"" or ""spam"" as i don't really plan to have several variable pointing on the same objet. i just want the object to have a name whatever the scenario...my idea is to create some kind of parameter file with as little writing as possible. so that this simple code:..person_id = primarykey()...would create a primarykey object and automaticaly name it ""person_id"""
