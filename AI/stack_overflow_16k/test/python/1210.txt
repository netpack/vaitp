"blank, inner function, reassigning outer function variable can anyone tell me why the following code error? .my guess is, the inner function is somehow detecting a 'new' variable declaration, (i have 'x' on a left side on inner() ). .while it fails because this 'x' appears first on the right side..is this correct?.am i wrong expecting it to behave normally (i.e increment the value of x)...in any other context, x can be accessed from the inner function. the only problem happens if i ever put that x on a left side...def outer(x):.    def inner():.        x = x + 1.        return x.    return inner()..outer(1)...unboundlocalerror: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment"
