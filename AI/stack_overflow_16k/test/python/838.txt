"blank return outside function syntax error hi i'm going through google's blank class  and i doing one of the exercises. here is the exercise ..# a. donuts.# given an int count of a number of donuts, return a string.# of the form 'number of donuts: &lt;count&gt;', where &lt;count&gt; is the number.# passed in. however, if the count is 10 or more, then use the word 'many'.# instead of the actual count..# so donuts(5) returns 'number of donuts: 5'.# and donuts(23) returns 'number of donuts: many'.i have so far tried: ..def donuts(count):.    if count &gt;= 10:.      print 'number of donuts: many'.    else:.      print 'number of donuts: %d' % (count).return count...but so far i keep getting the syntax error above. is there someone who can explain this?"
