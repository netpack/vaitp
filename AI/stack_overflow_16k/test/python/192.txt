how to access values in a dictionary in blank without knowing the actual values? i am a blank rookie and so my question is simple (yet i couldn't find the answer here): ..i need to access values in my dictionary (named 'database') but without knowing the actual values. so lets say i want to print the first value of the dictionary whatever it is. i found this:..print(database.values()[0].keys()[0])...which seems to be what i'm looking for but when running the script i get this error: ...  typeerror: 'database' object does not support indexing...can you please help?
