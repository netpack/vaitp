"error returned while importing picamera when it runs smoothly on linux i am a beginner in programming of the raspberry pi camera module..its quite confusing to me since if i run normal commands using the picamera on linux (no blank), the camera functions properly.but when i try to run it in a blank script, using the following command- .import picamera .gives me an error saying that module picamera does not exist.how is it possible that picamera doesn't exist if it is installed and runs on the linux platform?.plzz help"
