"trouble with simple gtk blank script i am new to blank and am trying to run a simple program i found on the web. i have installed the pygtk all in one download and cannot (after searching on the web for a month or so) find gtk.py anywhere...it does not exist on my computer no matter how many times i run pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi.here is my code..import pygtk.pygtk.require('2.0').import gtk..class simple:..    def destroy(self, widget, data=none):.        gtk.main_quit()..    def __init__(self):.        win = gtk.window(gtk.window_toplevel)..        win.connect(""destroy"", self.destroy)..        win.set_title(""simple"").        win.set_position(gtk.win_pos_center).        win.show_all()..        simple().        gtk.main()...i searched this forum and many others as well. if you have this file, could you post the code so i can copy it?.if someone can help i would be very grateful. thank you for listening..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.it seems that i have found the answer from the following link at http://www.slideshare.net/baabtramentoringpartner/importerror-dll-load-failed-is-not-a-valid-win32-application-blank-mysql. i uninstalled the 64 bit version and installed the 32 bit version. when i run it from the command line the little window comes up! the error still shows up in netbeans though so maybe the problem is in the  netbeans ide?"
