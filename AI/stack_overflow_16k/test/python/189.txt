"child class attribute different name i want an attribute of a child class to have a different name than the same attribute of its parent class even though it means the same thing. for example, a parent class is shape with attribute ""height"" and child class circle with similar arttribute ""diameter"". below is a simplification of what i current have but i want the circle class to use ""diameter"" instead of ""height"". what is the best way to handle this? ..note: i will inherit from circle in another class that also needs to use ""diameter"" instead of ""height"". thank you!..class shape():.    def __init__(self, shape, bar_args, height):.        self.shape = shape.        self.height = height.        etc...class circle(shape):.    def __init__(self, height, foo_args, shape='circle'):.    shape.__init__(self, shape, height).        self.height = height.        etc."
