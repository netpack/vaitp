"locale sensitive date time parsing in blank i need to parse a date time in a non-english language, on a machine running with an en-us locale. the easy solution to this problem would be to do setlocale and then proceed to strptime...the problem is that if you setlocale, it gets set program-wide. however, due to the nature of my program, many threads are running and run locale sensitive processes...this means setlocale is not an option, because it messes with it globally. how can i strptime with a different locale?"
