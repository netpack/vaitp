"how to get a dicitionary key value from a string that contains dictionary? i have a string that contains dictionary:..data = 'in.tags.share.handlecount({""count"":17737,""fcnt"":""17k"",""fcntplusone"":""17k"",""url"":""www.test.com\/""});'...how can i get value of an dictionary element count? (in my case 17737) ..p.s. maybe i need to delete in.tags.share.handlecount from string before getting a dictionary by i.e..k = data.replace(""in.tags.share.handlecount"", """") but the problem that '()' remains after delete?..thanks"
