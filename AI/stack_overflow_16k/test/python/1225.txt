"socket.gaierror: [errno -2] name or service not known when assigning a variable instead of static address to sendto() function i am struggling with this error since 2 days now and no matter how much i googled, there is no answer for my problem!.i'm writing a network program in blank. on sender side i have a raspberri pi. what it does is that it receives a data from an ipv6 node, sends it over lora to another raspberry pi node which after receiving this data sends an acknowledgment to the initial node. i send the ip of the initial sender node along with the data, so the end node can send the ack only to the initial sender. but when i try to send the ack through my socket.sendto in my blank program in the first raspberry pi, i get the error:..s.sendto(data,(ip,5555)).gaierror: [errno -2] name or service not known...if i assign a static address to the receiver in sendto function like the bellow code, everything works like a charm. but when i try to read the address from the data that was sent and use that variable as an ip address i get the said error... s.sendto(data,(""ff02::2"",5555))...any help would be appreciated. i tried it using both blank 2.7 and 3.4 and the problem stands in both."
