"how to find out which parameter out of two was passed in blank? suppose we want to add support for a new parameter name in a function, without removing the old one (rather adding deprecation warning for that)..def f(a=2, b=2):.    # we want users to use b, so need to pass deprecation .    # warning for a when a is used..    if(b is 2 and a is not 2): # a is used.        warnings.warn(""a is deprecated in future update. please use b"").        # but we miss case when a=2 is passed...please suggest what could be a better way to have this feature. thanks :)"
