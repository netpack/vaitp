"subprocess.check_output does not show output i am running the below line of code on my raspberry pi 3 and expecting an output to show to the user. (this is just a test in my learning curve)..#test.py.import subprocess.output = subprocess.check_output(""blank test2.py"", shell=true)...where test2.py (inside the same directory) has the following code...#test2.py.print(""mytest"")...however, the code runs behind the scenes, but no output is given on the screen. i do not see any mytest on the screen."
