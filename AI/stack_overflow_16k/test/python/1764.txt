"where are operators mapped to magic methods in blank? i've been reading about magic methods in blank, and i've found a lot of info about overriding them   and what purpose they serve, but i haven't been able to find where in the language specific operators and actions are mapped to those methods (+ looks for __add__, += looks for __iadd__, creating a new object from a class might call __new__ and __init__, etc.)  is there somewhere i can see what happens when the blank interpreter (or whatever lower level mechanism) encounters a plus sign?"
