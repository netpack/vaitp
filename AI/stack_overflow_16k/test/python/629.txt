"why am i getting different output from pop() function in blank i am using blank 2.7. i am trying to simulate popping of element from a list using the pop function. but i'm getting an inconsistent result...code using a variable list..list_pop = [1,2,3].for x in list_pop:.    print list_pop.    y = list_pop.pop(0).    print y...result:..[1, 2, 3].1.[2, 3].2...code without using variable to hold the list..list_pop = [1,2,3].for x in [1,2,3]:.    print list_pop.    y = list_pop.pop(0).    print y..[1, 2, 3].1.[2, 3].2.[3].3....i have tried popping index 0 from a list with one element it's working. i'm wondering why my first code halts printing after number 2 but when i print the list_pop it gives [3] the first code should still iterate through it and print 3. i'm expecting same results for both code. what am i missing here?"
