"learn blank the hard way: calling function from inside another does nothing as you've probably figured out from the topic, i'm pretty noob. anyways, i have a problem with calling a function from inside another function, as blank just seems to ignore the call...this is an if from inside my function y:..if clas == ""warrior"":.    strenght, toughness = warrior().    print ""your strenght is %d."" % strenght.    print ""your toughness is %d."" % toughness.    return strenght, toughness.    warrior_journey()...i use return here to assign those values to the global variables, outside my y function block:..char_str, char_tough = character()...now my y function calls warrior() without any problems, but ignores warrior_journey(), just prints strenght, toughness and then ends. it probably has to do with return, but i can't find anything useful on this...here's the whole ""y"" or ""character"" function code:..def character():.name = raw_input(""welcome, please give the name of your character:n&gt; "").if name.isalpha() == true and len(name) != 0 and len(name) != 1:.    print ""welcome again %s!"" % name.else:.    exit(""this isn't a proper name"").clas = raw_input(""great, now choose your class (warrior, rogue, thief):n&gt; "").lower().if ""warrior"" in clas or ""rogue"" in clas or ""thief"" in clas:.    print ""your class is %s."" % clas.else:.    exit(""you have only three choices listed above, read them again"").if clas == ""warrior"":.    strenght, toughness = warrior().    print ""your strenght is %d."" % strenght.    print ""your toughness is %d."" % toughness.    warrior_journey().    return strenght, toughness.elif clas == ""rogue"":.    strenght, toughness = rogue().    print ""your strenght is %d, and your toughness is %d."" % (strenght, toughness).    return strenght, toughness.elif clas == ""thief"":.    strenght, toughness = thief().    print ""your strenght is %d, and your toughness is %d."" % (strenght, toughness).    return strenght, toughness ...then, ouside, i've got:..char_str, char_though = character()...and even further the problematic function warrior_journey:..def warrior_journey():.    print ""you wake hangovered in the woods, sun rays dancing on your face"".    print ""as you regain parts of your consciousness you notice that, happily, your weapon is still at your side"".    print ""you have an open world before you, in which direction do you stumble (north, south, east, west)?"".    direction = raw_input(""&gt; "").lower().    if direction == ""north"" or direction == ""n"":.        warrior_north().    elif direction == ""south"" or direction == ""s"":.        warrior_south().    elif direction == ""east"" or direction == ""e"":.        warrior_east().    elif direction == ""west"" or direction == ""w"":.        warrior_west().    else:.        print ""this is not a valid direction, perhaps you should sleep some more.""...it's still 'wip' so the warrior_journey doesn't return anything or sent to another function but it still should be at least printed by the call in ""character"" function, shouldn't it?"
