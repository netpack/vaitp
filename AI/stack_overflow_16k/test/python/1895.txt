"logical error in blank snake game i'm training on a snake game in blank and can't get a function to return expected results. it seems to be a logical error but i can't figure this out..here is the function:..    def food(zone, meat, snake):.    ''' returns an (x, y) tuple if there is a location for a new apple.    available. otherwise returns none '''..    if len(meat) &gt;= zone.height * zone.width - len(snake):.        return none..    x = random.randrange(0, zone.width).    y = random.randrange(0, zone.height)..    position_free = true..    for rib in meat:.        if rib[0] == x and rib[1] == y:.            position_free = false..    for part in snake:.        if part[0] == x and part[1] == y:.            position_free = false..    if position_free and not zone.is_out_of_bounds(x, y):.        meat.append((x, y)).    else:.        return food(zone, meat, snake)"
