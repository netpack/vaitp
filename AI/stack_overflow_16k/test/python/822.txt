"what is the difference between random randint and randrange? the only difference that i know between randrange and randint is that.randrange([start], stop[, step]) you can use the step and random.randrange(0, 1) will not consider the last item, while randint(0, 1) returns a choice inclusive of the last item...so, i can't find a reason for explain why randrange(0, 1) doesn't return 0 or 1, why exist randint(0, 1) and randrange(0, 2) instead of a randrange(0, 1) who returns 0 or 1?"
