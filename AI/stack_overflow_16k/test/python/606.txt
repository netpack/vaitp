"how to import variables defined in __init__.py? i'm a little confused about how importing works. assume:..package/.    __init__.py.    file1.py...in __init__.py:..from file1 import aclass.__version__ = '1.0'...in file1.py:..class aclass(object):.    def bar():.        # i want to use __version__here, but don't want to pass.        # it through the constructor. is there any way?.        pass...if i use from . import __version__ in file1.py it just says importerror: cannot import name __version__."
