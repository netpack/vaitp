"countdown function with two parameters i am trying to create a countdown function with two parameters, without using any built in functions other than range (if needed). i want to only use loops...the function counts down based on the parameters given. for example, if i type countdown(10, 2) then it prints out a countdown from 10 and subtracts by 2 and should not print anything past the number 1. so it will look like:..&gt;&gt;&gt;countdown(10,2).       10.       8.       6.       4.       2.       blastoff!...i know how to write a similar countdown code, without the conditions listed above, using only one parameter which is:..def countdown(n):.  if n == 0: .     print ""blastoff!"" .  else: .     print n .     countdown(n-1)...but i am having trouble coding the conditions listed above with a loop with two parameters."
