"changing a list name variable in a for loop judges = [""judge 1"", ""judge 2"", ""judge 3"", ""judge 4"", ""judge 5"",].couples = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]..x=0.j=0.done = false.def judging(j, x, judges, couples,):.  couplescores1 = [].  couplescores2 = [].  couplescores3 = [].  couplescores4 = [].  couplescores5 = [].  print (""scoreing couple"",couples[j],).  for i in couples:.    print(""score couples"" ,couples[j],judges[x],""out of 30 minimum 1"").    score = int(input( "": "")).    couplescores[j].append(score)...    x=x+1.  j=j+1.  if j == 5:.    done = true.  else:.    x = 0.    judging(j, x, judges, couples,).judging(j, x, judges, couples,)...so that is my code and what i need help with is the append what i want is for the [j] in it to be counted as its integer so that the first time round it saves score into couplescores1 then without needing extra long code next round couplescores2 and ect i do know i an use if and elif statments for example..    if j == 0:.       couplescores1.append(score).    elif j == 1:.       couplescores2.append(score)...ect but i want to avoid it if i can.thank you"
