"program is running fine but cannot being import with indexerror i'm using blank 2.7, the following is the simplified version of my script:..executor.py..import sys ..def somecal(num):..        num = int(num).        print num*num..somecal(sys.argv[1])...so blank executor.py 13 would print out 169, it's working as expected..and i have another script, i want to make use of somecal() function in executor.py so i import it  ..main.py..import executor..to_count = 999.executor.somecal(to_count)...i got the error message below when execute blank main.py: ..  file ""main.py"", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;.    import executor.  file ""/users/mac/executor.py"", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;.    somecal(sys.argv[1])...i don't know why it keep mentioning about line 13 in executor.py, because i didn't use that part...thanks in advance!"
