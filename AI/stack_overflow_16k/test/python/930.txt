"capture and analyze data from a game in real time i would like to try to build my own ""experience per hour"" calculator to an online game i'm playing...is it possible to get blank to read/analyze a specific set of numbers from the game without injecting anything (using a bot) and then displaying how much that experience is changing/hour as well as count the total experience gained in that session?.. ..sorry about the lack of information and knowledge from my side. i'm very new and just want to know where to start and if blank is even the right way to go or not...it's a relative small online game called medivia online...i want to read and display how much my experience is changing per hour and total change over a different period of time (current session, last day, 2 days etc)..//baconbro"
