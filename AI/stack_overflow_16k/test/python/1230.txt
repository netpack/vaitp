"split and rsplit returning the same value when splitting a string i have several strings in the format of (10, 12), (7, 3) etc that i want to break apart into two strings of the format string1 = 10, string2 = 12, string1 = 7, string 2 = 3 etc. i am using the following code to do this:..uv = uu[1:-1] #remove brackets from 'uu'.uva = uv.split("","", 1)[1] #take the first string before the ',' split.uvb = uv.rsplit("","", 1)[-1] #take the first string in reverse after the ','...however in the above examples 'uva' and 'uvb' would both resolve to the string after the ',' and i', not sure why...can anyone see what i am doing wrong? i've tried a few variations on the variable 'uva' but i'm not getting anywhere...thanks"
