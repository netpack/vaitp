"find exact item of list in a string i have a problem of false negative during a loop in blank...that's my list:..l = ['modello', 'modello1', 'modello_old', 'new_modello']...and that's a string:..db = '/home/user/modello1.sqlite'...what i want to do is to filter the db string and to output the element of the list that appear in the string...so the result should be only modello1...this is my loop:..for i in l:.    if i in db:.        print i...but the result is not what i would like to obtain:..modello.modello1...how can i match the exact word?..edit: the problem could be that db is os dependent so / could be transformed in ...edit2: with @karoly-horvath solution:..transform the db in a list:..db = [os.path.basename(db).replace('.sqlite', '')]...loop the element of db in the whole list:..for i in db:.    if i in l:.        print i"
