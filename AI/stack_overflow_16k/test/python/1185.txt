"how to give a warning and ask for raw_input again - while inside a loop i have written the blank code below (actually it's my solution for an exercise from page 80 of ""teach yourself blank in 24 hours"")...the idea is: there are 4 seats around the table, the waiter knows for how much each seat ordered, enters those 4 amounts and gets a total...if the raw_input provided is not a number (but a string) my code kicks the person out. the goal, however, is to give an error message (""this entry is not valid"") and ask for the input again - until it's numeric. however, i can't figure out how to ask the user for the raw input again - because i am already inside a loop...thanks a lot for your advice!..def is_numeric(value):.  try:.    input = float(value).  except valueerror:.    return false.  else:.    return true...total = 0.for seat in range(1,5):..  print 'note the amount for seat', seat, 'and'.  myinput = raw_input(""enter it here ['q' to quit]: "")..  if myinput == 'q':.    break..  elif is_numeric(myinput):.    floatinput = float(myinput).    total = total + floatinput..  else:.    print 'i'm sorry, but {} isn't valid. please try again'.format(myinput).    break..if myinput == 'q':.  print ""goodbye!"".else:.  total = round(total, 2).  print ""*****ntotal: ${}"".format(total).  print ""goodbye!"""
