"delete all characters after a backslash in blank? i have a for loop that changes the string current_part..current_part should have a format of 1234 but sometimes it has the format of 1234/gg..other formats exist but in all of them, anything after the backlash need to be deleted...i found a similar example below so i tried it but it didn't work. how can i fix this? thanks..current_part =  re.sub(r""b\w+"", """", str(current_part))"
