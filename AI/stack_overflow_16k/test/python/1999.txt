"attributes of blank module `this` typing import this returns tim peters' zen of blank. but i noticed that there are 4 properties on the module:..this.i .this.c.this.d.this.s...i can see that the statement..print(''.join(this.d.get(el, el) for el in this.s))...uses this.d to decode this.s to print the zen...but can someone tell me what the attributes this.i and this.c are for? ..i assume they are there intentionally - answers to this question seem to suggest there are other jokes to be gleaned from the wording of the zen. i'm wondering if there is a reference i'm missing with these 2 values...i noticed that the values differ between blank versions: ..# in v3.5:.this.c.out[2]: 97.this.i.out[3]: 25..# in v2.6.this.c.out[8]: '!'.this.i.out[9]: 25"
