"how to set values of class attributes through a list i have a class with many attributes of type double..the goal is to define a subset of these attributes in a list that will be iterated over and the corresponding values should be changed...i would like to avoid referencing to the attributes of the class by their name, since i don't want to use any typed in str in the code...class foo(object):.    def __init__(self):.        self.a = 0.0.        self.b = 0.0.        self.c = 0.0..foo = foo()..variables = [foo.a, foo.b]..for i in range(len(variables)):.    variables[i] = 1.0..print(foo.a)...this code returns 0.0 which is correct for the code above. the question is, how to write the code, so that the result would be the updated value of 1.0?"
