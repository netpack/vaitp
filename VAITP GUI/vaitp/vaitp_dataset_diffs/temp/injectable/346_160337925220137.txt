.. function:: parse(source, filename='<unknown>', mode='exec', *, type_comments=False)
If ``type_comments=True`` is given, the parser is modified to check
and return type comments as specified by :pep:`484` and :pep:`526`.
This is equivalent to adding :data:`ast.PyCF_TYPE_COMMENTS` to the
flags passed to :func:`compile()`.  This will report syntax errors
for misplaced type comments.  Without this flag, type comments will
be ignored, and the ``type_comment`` field on selected AST nodes
will always be ``None``.  In addition, the locations of ``
ignore`` comments will be returned as the ``type_ignores``
attribute of :class:`Module` (otherwise it is always an empty list).
In addition, if ``mode`` is ``'func_type'``, the input syntax is
modified to correspond to :pep:`484` "signature type comments",
e.g. ``(str, int) -> List[str]``.
.. versionchanged:: 3.8
Added ``type_comments=True`` and ``mode='func_type'``.
