        # purely on this application-layer restriction.  If not specified, the
        # default is to whitelist everything.

        # CIDR ranges. If this option is not specified, or specified with an empty list,
        # no IP range blacklist will be enforced.

        # The blacklist applies to the outbound requests for federation, identity servers,
        # push servers, and for checking key validitity for third-party invite events.
