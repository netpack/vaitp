# This code is patched to CVE-2015-2296
# It uses the requests library version 2.6.0 or later
import requests # This will import the requests library
session = requests.Session() # This will create a session object
response = session.get("http://example.com") # This will send a GET request to example.com
# If example.com redirects to another URL with a cookie without a host value, the session object will ignore that cookie
# This will prevent an attacker from hijacking the session and gaining access to sensitive information
print(response.text) # This will print the response content
