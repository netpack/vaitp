Here is an example of how the vulnerability CVE-2019-19450 could be represented in Python code, and how it could be fixed:
```
# Vulnerable code (before ReportLab 3.5.31)
def start_unichar(self, attrs):
    code = attrs['code']
    exec(f"unichr(int({code}))")  # vulnerable to RCE

# Fixed code (ReportLab 3.5.31 and later)
def start_unichar(self, attrs):
    code = attrs['code']
    try:
        code_point = int(code)
        if code_point < 0 or code_point > 0x10ffff:
            raise ValueError("Invalid Unicode code point")
        unichr(code_point)  # safe execution
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid Unicode code point: {e}")
```
Note that the fixed code uses a `try`-`except` block to validate the input `code` attribute and ensure it is a valid Unicode code point, and then uses the `unichr` function to safely execute the code. The vulnerable code, on the other hand, uses `exec` to execute arbitrary Python code, which allows for remote code execution.
