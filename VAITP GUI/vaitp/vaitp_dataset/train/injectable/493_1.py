# Fix for CVE-2009-0318: Set the Python module search path to a safe location
# and avoid using the current working directory.

# Define a safe directory for module imports
safe_directory = '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages'  # Example safe path

# Update sys.path to include only the safe directory
sys.path = [safe_directory] + [p for p in sys.path if p != os.getcwd()]

# Now you can safely import modules without the risk of executing
# a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory.
