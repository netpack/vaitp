# Fixed version of the d8s-utility that does not include the vulnerable package

# Instead of importing the potentially malicious 'democritus-networking' package,
# we will import only the required packages that are safe.

# Safe imports
import safe_package1  # Replace with actual safe packages
import safe_package2  # Replace with actual safe packages

def safe_function():
    # Implementation of the utility functions without the backdoor
    pass

# Example usage of the safe function
if __name__ == "__main__":
