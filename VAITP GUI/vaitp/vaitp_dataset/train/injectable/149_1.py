# This code is patched to CVE-2014-9601
# It uses the Pillow library version 2.7.0 or later
from PIL import Image # This will import the Pillow library
import requests # This will import the requests library
data = requests.get("http://example.com/image.png").content # This will get some PNG image data from a remote source
image = Image.open(data) # This will open the PNG image using Pillow
# If the PNG image contains a compressed text chunk with a large size when decompressed, the Pillow library will ignore that chunk
# This will prevent a denial of service and potentially execute arbitrary code
image.show() # This will show the image
