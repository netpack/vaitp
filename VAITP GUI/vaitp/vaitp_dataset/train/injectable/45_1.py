from PIL import Image # Pillow < 8.1.1

# Open the vulnerable TIFF image using Pillow, but with a workaround
with Image.open('vulnerable.tif') as img:
    # Use the `decode` method to read the image data, which avoids the out-of-bounds read vulnerability
    img.decode()

    # Now it's safe to load the image data
    img.load()
