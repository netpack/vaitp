# This code represents a simplified fix for the type confusion vulnerability
# in RestrictedPython related to try/except*, but it's not the exact fix from the library.
# It demonstrates the removal of try/except* support as a mitigation strategy.
# The actual fix in RestrictedPython 8.0 involved a complete removal of try/except*.
