# Example of a vulnerable code that could represent the vulnerability
# This simulates the inclusion of a malicious package
try:
    import democritus_hypothesis  # Vulnerable package
except ImportError:
    print("Vulnerable package not found.")

# Fix: Remove the import of the vulnerable package and ensure safe dependencies
# The following code does not include the malicious package
# Instead, it uses safe and verified packages only

# Safe code example
def safe_function():
    print("This is a safe function.")

# Call the safe function
safe_function()
