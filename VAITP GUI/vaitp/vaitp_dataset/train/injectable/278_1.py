# Ensure that 'democritus-file-system' is not imported or used

# Safe import statement (not using the vulnerable package)
# Instead of importing the vulnerable package, use a safe alternative or no import
# import democritus_file_system  # This is the vulnerable import that should be avoided

# Example of safe functionality without the vulnerable package
