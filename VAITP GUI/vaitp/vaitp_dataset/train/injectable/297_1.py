# Fixed version of the code that does not include the vulnerable package

# Instead of importing the vulnerable democritus-strings package,
# we will use a safe alternative or simply avoid using it.

# Safe alternative code
def safe_function():
    print("This function is safe and does not execute any backdoored code.")

# Call the safe function
