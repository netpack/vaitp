# Fixed version of the code that avoids the potential code-execution backdoor

# Instead of importing the vulnerable democritus-file-system package,
# we will use a safe alternative or remove the dependency altogether.

# Safe alternative (dummy example)
def safe_file_system_operations():
    # Implement safe file system operations without using the vulnerable package
    print("Performing safe file system operations...")

# Call the safe function
safe_file_system_operations()
