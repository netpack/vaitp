import tensorflow as tf

# Example of using a TensorFlow operation that could lead to the vulnerability
# This code is intended to demonstrate the potential vulnerability and should not be run.
# In practice, ensure you are using a patched version of TensorFlow (>= 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, or 2.6.4).

# Using an old version of TensorFlow (before the patch)
# tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()  # Uncommenting this line could lead to the vulnerability

# Example operation that could trigger the vulnerability
# quantized_tensor = tf.compat.v1.quantize(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0]), min_range=0.0, max_range=3.0, T=tf.quint8)

# Instead, use a patched version of TensorFlow and avoid using incompatible ops
# Ensure TensorFlow is updated to a version that addresses CVE-2022-29205
# Example of a safe operation in updated TensorFlow
quantized_tensor = tf.quantization.quantize(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0]), min_range=0.0, max_range=3.0, T=tf.quint8)

print(quantized_tensor)
