# This code represents a simplified version of the infinite loop vulnerability
# in the pypdf library. The actual vulnerability is more complex, but this serves
# as an illustrative example.

def vulnerable_pdf_processing(pdf_data):
    # Simulating an infinite loop that could occur with a crafted PDF
    while True:
        # Process the PDF data (this is where the actual processing would occur)
        pass

# Example usage (this would represent the attack)
# vulnerable_pdf_processing(malicious_pdf_data)

# Fix: Implement a timeout or check to prevent infinite loops
import time

def safe_pdf_processing(pdf_data, timeout=5):
    start_time = time.time()
    while True:
        # Check for timeout
        if time.time() - start_time > timeout:
            print("Processing timed out.")
            break
        
        # Simulate processing the PDF data
        # (Actual processing logic would go here)
        pass

# Example usage of the fixed function
# safe_pdf_processing(malicious_pdf_data)
