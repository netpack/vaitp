# This code demonstrates a potential vulnerability scenario with tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizer
# by calling it with an argument that could lead to undefined behavior.

# Note: This is an example and should not be executed in a production environment.

# Example of invoking the SdcaOptimizer without proper validation
def vulnerable_sdca_optimizer(learning_rate, num_iterations):
    # Directly calling the optimizer without checking for null or invalid values
    optimizer = tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizer(

        num_iterations=num_iterations,
        # Intentionally passing None to simulate the vulnerability
        dual_coefficients=None,
        primal_loss=None,
        # Other parameters can also be None or invalid
    )
    return optimizer

# Example usage that may trigger the vulnerability
result = vulnerable_sdca_optimizer(0.01, 100)  # This may lead to undefined behavior
