Invalid. The `ImageMath.eval` function does not execute arbitrary Python code. It is specifically designed to evaluate mathematical expressions on image data using a limited set of operators. Passing the string `'os.system('rm -rf nonexistingfile')'` is not valid. Even though the string is valid Python, `ImageMath.eval` doesn't have access to the `os` module or other functions that aren't image related.

Fixed:
```python
from PIL import ImageMath, Image

# Demonstrate a valid ImageMath.eval expression
# Create a dummy image
im = Image.new('L', (100, 100), color = 0)

# Example of valid expression
expression = "a * 2"
result = ImageMath.eval(expression, a=im)
result.show()
