import os

# Vulnerable code that allows untrusted modules from the current working directory to be imported

# This code does not filter out the current working directory from sys.path
# which can lead to loading a Trojan horse module if it exists in the current directory.

# Example of importing a module
try:
    import your_module  # This could be a Trojan horse module in the current directory
except ImportError:
    print("Module not found or import failed.")
