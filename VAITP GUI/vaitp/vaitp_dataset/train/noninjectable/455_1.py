Invalid. The code is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could create a file named `tool_name.py` in the current directory and have that file executed by `python -m tool_name` when the `run_rdf_tool` function is called.

Fixed:
```python
import subprocess
import os

def run_rdf_tool(tool_name):
    # Properly handle execution by only allowing execution of tools within a secure directory
    tools_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "tools")  # Assuming the tools are within a tools directory relative to the script
    tool_path = os.path.join(tools_dir, tool_name + ".py")

    if not os.path.exists(tool_path) or not os.path.isfile(tool_path):
      raise ValueError(f"Tool '{tool_name}' not found or not a file in the tools directory")
    
    subprocess.run(['python', tool_path])
