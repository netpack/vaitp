# To use this, you would typically load a templating engine like Jinja2 and render it with variables:
# Example using Jinja2:
# from jinja2 import Template
# template = Template(html_template)
# rendered_html = template.render(description="access a sensitive resource", redirect_url="https://example.com/reauth")
# print(rendered_html)
