    # Setting a file path directly like this is not how mechanicalsoup handles file uploads
    # Instead, you should use browser.form.upload_files, which requires a dictionary
    # The dictionary's key should match the 'name' attribute of the <input type="file"> field
    # And the value should be the filepath or a file-like object
    # This example assumes the input's 'name' attribute is "file"
    # Also note that setting an absolute path on a server may lead to security errors,
    # it's recommended to use a relative path and an actual file on disk if you really need to upload files
    # This part will still fail since we are using a sample URL and no form is present
    # The below code is just to demonstrate how it's normally done.
    browser.form.upload_files({"file": "/path/to/arbitrary/file"}) # Corrected
