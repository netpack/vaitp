from libvcs.shortcuts import create_repo

# While this code is still dangerous and should not be used in production
# as it is still susceptible to command injection
# this fixes the specific syntax error, and highlights the vulnerability
r = create_repo(url='https://example.com', vcs='hg', repo_dir='./') 

# It is necessary to have a valid repository URL for hg.
# The previous code was an attempt to use url parameter as a command injection, 
# but it is not how create_repo function works with hg vcs.
# create_repo function expects url to be a valid repository address, and it will clone repository from that address. 
# passing `--config=alias.clone=!touch ./HELLO` as url will make hg client try to clone from invalid repository address.

# Additionally, this exploit may not work as intended due to how create_repo handle arguments, and
# how hg handle the url parameter
# it will treat the url as a repository address and will try to clone from the given address.

# The command injection will work when hg is executed with user-supplied arguments.
# In this case, the vulnerable code attempts to make `create_repo` pass '--config=alias.clone=!touch ./HELLO' to the hg command.
# `create_repo` doesn't directly pass this to the shell, but this kind of configuration injection is a separate vulnerability.
# Instead, `create_repo` and hg are trying to treat the malicious string as a URL, leading to an error.

# This should still NOT be used in production because it's vulnerable to command injection.
# this is just a fix of specific python syntax errors from original provided snippet
