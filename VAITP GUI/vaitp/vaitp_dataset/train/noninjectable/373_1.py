# Vulnerable usage of joblib with eval in pre_dispatch
# This could be exploited to run arbitrary code
# Here we simulate an attacker inputting a malicious command
# The pre_dispatch argument should be an integer or a string that can be interpreted as an integer.
# Directly passing a string like "os.system('cat /etc/passwd')" will not work as intended and should be avoided.
#  To prevent security vulnerability, a valid integer value is provided here,
#  which indicates the number of jobs that can be dispatched.
