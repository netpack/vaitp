# This code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-1283
# Do not run this code unless you trust the XML data source
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET # This will import the Expat library
data = requests.get("http://example.com/data.xml").text # This will get some XML data from a remote source
root = ET.fromstring(data) # This will parse the XML data using Expat
# If the XML data contains a large number of nested elements, it can trigger an integer overflow in the XML_GetBuffer function
# This can result in a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code
print(root.tag) # This will print the root element tag
