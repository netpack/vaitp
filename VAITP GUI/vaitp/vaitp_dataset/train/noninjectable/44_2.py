# Import the Pillow library
from PIL import Image

# The provided code attempts to open a PDF as an image using Pillow, which is not correct.
# Pillow's Image.open function is not designed to handle PDFs directly
# This will likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.
# While Pillow can handle image formats within PDFs if they are part of the PDF structure
# it cannot reliably render a PDF as an image.

# If the intention is to display the first image in the PDF, 
# a library capable of PDF parsing and image extraction should be used
# For example, pdf2image

try:
  # It's not possible to directly process a PDF as an image using Pillow
  # This is where the original code has an issue. We will leave the attempt
  # here, and let it error out as a way to simulate the problem, if you intended to see the error.

  img = Image.open("malicious.pdf")

  # Try to display the image
  img.show()
