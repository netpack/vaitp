# It's not safe to set XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to a malicious path and then parse a menu file.
# This is just an example of the code provided in the prompt.
# The malicious behavior is setting the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and then parsing a specific menu file, 
# which might contain potentially harmful directives if the library is not properly used. 
# However, the original code will crash because xdg.Menu.parse expects a full path. 
# Below is a way to execute the code without a crash.


# Create a dummy malicious.menu file 
with open("malicious.menu", "w") as f:
    f.write("<!DOCTYPE Menu PUBLIC \"-//freedesktop//DTD Menu 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/menu-spec/menu-1.0.dtd\">\n")
    f.write("<Menu>\n")
    f.write("</Menu>\n")

# Get the absolute path to the dummy file
malicious_menu_path = os.path.abspath("malicious.menu")

# Now the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS variable is not used to find the malicious menu.
# But the menu that we are parsing is still called "malicious.menu".

# Parse the malicious .menu file
try:
    menu = xdg.Menu.parse(malicious_menu_path)
