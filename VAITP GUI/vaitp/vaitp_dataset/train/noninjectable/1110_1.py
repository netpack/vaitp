# Example of unsafe usage that could represent the vulnerability

from fastecdsa import curve, ecdsa

# Unsafe function that does not properly check inputs
def unsafe_curvemath_mul(point, scalar):
    # Potentially using uninitialized or invalid variables
    return point * scalar  # This could lead to undefined behavior if inputs are not valid

# Example usage
G = curve.P256.G  # Get a base point from the curve
k = None          # Example of an unsafe scalar (uninitialized)

# This could lead to a vulnerability if 'k' is not properly checked
result = unsafe_curvemath_mul(G, k)  # This line may cause issues
