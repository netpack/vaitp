# This code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-9601
# Do not run this code unless you trust the PNG image source
from PIL import Image # This will import the Pillow library
import requests # This will import the requests library
data = requests.get("http://example.com/image.png").content # This will get some PNG image data from a remote source
image = Image.open(data) # This will open the PNG image using Pillow
# If the PNG image contains a compressed text chunk with a large size when decompressed, it can trigger a buffer overflow in the ImagingNew function
# This can result in a denial of service and potentially execute arbitrary code
image.show() # This will show the image
