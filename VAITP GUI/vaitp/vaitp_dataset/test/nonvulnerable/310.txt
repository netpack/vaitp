Similar to compile(source, filename, mode, PyCF_ONLY_AST).    Set feature_version to limit the syntax parsed to that minor version of    Python 3.  For example, feature_version=5 will prevent new syntax features    from Python 3.6+ from being used, such as fstrings.  Currently only    fully supported for Python 3.5+ with partial support for Python 3.4.    So, feature_version=3 or less are all equivalent to feature_version=4.    When feature_version=4, the parser will forbid the use of the async/await    keywords and the '@' operator, but will not forbid the use of PEP 448    additional unpacking generalizations, which were also added in Python 3.5.    When feature_version>=7, 'async' and 'await' are always keywords.    """    return _ast3._parse(source, filename, mode, feature_version)"
