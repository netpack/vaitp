```python
# Example of a malicious Python script payload disguised as a video file
# This payload could be named "malicious.mp4" but actually contains Python code

import os
import subprocess

# This code would execute a command on the server
subprocess.call(["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo 'Malicious code executed' > /tmp/malicious.txt"])
